Abstract = {The initially happy and rewarding quest of the human mind in
   understanding itself and the universe was thwarted by unexpectedly
   fierce opposition. The clouds on the horizon turned into an
   existentially threatening thunderstorm. All our human intuitions turned
   out to be untenable. The nature of reality and consciousnesses is as
   elusive as ever. Against this backdrop, our modern post-truth world is
   infused with ignorance and anti-intellectualism. ``My ignorance is as
   good as your knowledge.{''} Conspiracy theories abound. Trench wars are
   fought along social, political, and religious delimitations. Most
   tragically, we have reached a level of technological prowess, lacking
   any signs of collective intelligence, which is resulting in the
   systematic and rampant destruction of the biosphere. This book is an
   invitation to reevaluate everything-mixing imagination with critical
   thinking. Could there be something we don't yet know about ourselves and
   the universe, the knowledge of which could change everything? Before
   addressing this question, notions of collective intelligence,
   self-organization, scientific utilitarianism, and radical
   open-mindedness are explored.

Abstract = {After twenty-five years of political unrest, in 1814 some Europeans were
   not willing to accept the peace and order Louis XVIII imposed on them.
   Instead, these men of action turned to extra-legal (conspiracies) and
   clandestine (secret societies) activities, fighting violently against
   the restored political system. Faithful to the legacies of the
   Revolution and the Counter-revolution, they also fought among
   themselves, adapting to changing political practices to impose their
   ideas. This passion led them across Europe, particularly into Italy and
   Spain.
   Francois Husson, a former officer in Napoleon, launched in 1820 a
   subversive activity places in for several months at the center of all
   planned maneuvers in France and Spain. This man sent by Parisian
   director of the Carbonari Committee to liberal elites of the Peninsula,
   will commit himself unreservedly to the victory of the ``Sainte-Alliance
   des Peuples.{''} His exceptional life, highlighted when you explore the
   archives, allows to understand the motivations and contradictions of
   this character who was, despite himself, originally a founding act of
   the Spanish republicanism : The dramatic episode of martires de la
   Libertad Espanola (Tarifa, 1824).},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed debates about so-called ``cancel culture{''}
   and more broadly about online accountability practices. Here we revisit
   this topic through a study of YouTube ``drama,{''} a hybrid genre where
   creators provide commentary on the scandals, scams, and feuds between
   YouTube celebrities. Drawing on cultural studies scholarship, and based
   on qualitative interviews and content analysis, we argue that YouTube
   drama embodies a range of cultural and moral negotiations that take
   place on social media platforms. We conceptualize accountability
   practices on YouTube as an ongoing ``platform drama{''} in which
   creators engage in perpetual and highly visible power struggles with
   celebrities, audiences, legacy media, other creators, and YouTube
   itself. Within the context of this ``platform drama,{''} structural
   issues and interpersonal conflicts become blurred, as do accountability
   practices and monetized spectacles. We analyze ``cancelation{''} on
   YouTube as a ritualistic practice in which structural tensions are
   publicly negotiated and performed, even as accountability itself remains
   largely elusive.},

Journal = {SYNTHESE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {To understand lying, we naturally focus on small scale lies involving
   one speaker, one listener, one assertion. This methodology confers
   artificial plausibility upon the requirement that liars intend to
   deceive. For it excludes principal-agent conflicts that emerge from
   linguistic division of labor. When an employee lies for her boss, she
   need not inherit his motive to deceive. She displays loyalty even if her
   lie does not deceive. Focus on a single lie in isolation also blinds us
   to tactical deceptions such as telling a lie which is intended to be
   caught to advance another lie. Many of these complexities arise from
   situations that approximate common knowledge without quite crystallizing
   into this uniform transparency.},

Title = {On the problem of an NKVD residentura (residency) in the Ghetto of
   Warsaw, 1941-1942},
Journal = {PAMIEC I SPRAWIEDLIWOSC},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {2},
Number = {8},
Pages = {197-216},
Abstract = {One of the most surprising aspects of the history of the Ghetto of
   Warsaw was that it constituted for some time a relatively safe refuge
   for anti-German conspiracies. By the end of 1941, a rumor appeared that
   the Ghetto had become a seat of the NKVD. Historians hotly debate this
   information. This article, an extension of a paper given during the 2003
   conference on ``The Holocaust and Intelligence{''} and a part of a
   larger project on ``The Holocaust, Communism, and the Jews of
   Warsaw,{''} examines the issue of the Ghetto residentura.
   From the beginning of the war, the Jews participated in numerous
   underground organizations in Poland. Almost all leftist conspiracies
   created their centers in Warsaw and had their cells in its Ghetto. After
   the German attack against the Soviet Union, Polish communists
   intensified their activities. In January 1942, they were invited to the
   newly established Polish Workers' Party, which also grew quickly in the
   Ghetto of Warsaw.
   The resistance led by the Polish Government-in-Exile kept an eye on the
   leftist groups. In 1943, it established the Civic Anticommunist
   Committee (Spo.eczny Komitet Antykomunistyczny). Its archive includes
   documents produced by Polish underground intelligence institutions
   active from 1939. The earliest report, from October 13, 1941, describes
   the activities of Colonel Glebov in the Ghetto of Warsaw. Previously, on
   September 6, 1941, General Stefan Grot-Rowecki, Commander-in-Chief of
   the Home Army, informed his supervisors in London that a number of
   Soviet parachutists were spotted in German-occupied Poland and that an
   NKVD Major Klebov hid in the Ghetto. Another document from the
   ``strictly confidential personal papers{''} of Stanis.aw Miko.ajczyk, a
   Deputy Prime Minister of the Government-in-Exile, from September 20,
   1941, describes `` the activities of the Comintern's agents on the
   Polish territories,{''}including a certain ``Klebow/Clebow/
   Glebow.{''}In May 1942, Polish resistance reported on a Red Army
   Commissar Klimkov working in Warsaw. After the destruction of the Ghetto
   of Warsaw in May 1943, new information about an NKVD residentura
   appeared. It included Jewish survivors but operated mostly on the
   outskirts of Warsaw and was dominated by Russians and Poles.
   Considering all the contextual elements of Warsaw's situation in 1940
   and 1941, it is likely that NKVD agents operated in the Ghetto. The
   intelligence operations in the Ghetto of Warsaw constitute a legitimate
   issue worthy of further study. Systematic research in the Russian
   archives can present a completely new picture of the Jewish communist
   resistance in Warsaw only sketched in this article.},

Abstract = {The study examines how truth-tellers and truth-telling can be cultivated
   in the context of post-truth politics in the U.S. Following Foucault, it
   is not concerned with examining the problem of truth, with the
   philosophical question of how truth is determined, but with the problem
   of truth-tellers or truth-telling as a practical activity of
   self-improvement. To this end, the study traces the emergence and nature
   of post-truth politics in the U.S. and analyzes its relation to patterns
   of fascist propaganda and the psychological appeal of authoritarian
   leaders through a psycho-social perspective. To counter the nature and
   ubiquity of post-truth politics, the unrelenting flow of lies,
   disinformation, and conspiracy theories disseminated by the far-right
   news and information ecosystem, the author argues that educators can
   help students recognize truth-tellers and become truth-tellers
   themselves by employing certain pedagogical strategies, informed by
   Foucault's analysis of parrhesia, that can equip them to criticize and
   resist post-truth propaganda and demagogues.},

Abstract = {In this article we present the emergence of a consumer community
   resisting a national mythology that milk is a central constituent of a
   healthy life style. This unfolds in a contemporary consumptionscape in
   which the consumer body and health is the subject of a number of
   moralisms and counter moralisms. The case is an example of how
   commercial and official (moral) definitions of health and collective
   identity are reinterpreted in the establishment of a counter-mythology.
   This counter-mythology contests an alleged conspiracy between industry
   and public health authorities. Dairy producers have expropriated the
   structural mythological ties between milk and the nurturing aspects of
   family, a process which is underpinned by medical discourses that point
   to the connection between health and milk consumption. It explores the
   formation of a counter consumer mythology as it unfolds in the
   interaction between self-proclaimed experts and consumer-to-consumer
   communication. We detect four stages in what we suggest is a recursive,
   for example, non-linear, process of consumer community formation.
   Finally, the emergent mythologies and moralism from these processes are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the role of the Irish defence forces in 1969-70 as
   the Irish state reacted to the emergence of the Northern troubles.
   Ireland had never envisaged using its army to take by force what Britain
   would not concede through negotiation. In the absence of an obvious
   external threat, and because of the legacy of the 1924 army mutiny, the
   state maintained only very small and ill-equipped forces, trained
   exclusively for conventional warfare and actively discouraged from any
   strategic or tactical study of Northern Ireland. The gun-running plans
   and other clandestine schemes promoted by an army intelligence officer
   and disclosed in the 1970 arms crisis were correctly interpreted in
   London as a conspiracy led by two ambitious ministers impatient at the
   relative restraint of government policy, rather than as the secret
   element of a two-pronged Irish policy of overt reasonableness and covert
   destabilisation of Northern Ireland. The article also maintains that
   there was no possibility at any point of a military coup against the
   Lynch government.},

Journal = {AFRICA},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {75},
Number = {4},
Pages = {467-487},
Abstract = {The second, or informal, economy developed later in Lubumbashi (DRC)
   than it had in Kinshasa. The Katanga metropolis, long protected from the
   process of informalization thanks to its large industrial complexes,
   suffered seriously from the crisis of the 1990s which led to the
   collapse of the mining industry and, more generally, of the whole
   salaried sector. After a brief history of the city and of the state of
   play of the informal economy, this article attempts a detailed analysis
   of this economy's lexicon. Expressions newly created from Swahili,
   French and other languages provide an excellent point of entry into the
   concrete practices of this sector, as well as the representations and
   morality on which such practices are based. Strongly associated with
   expressions of energy, cunning and conspiracy, the vocabulary emerging
   from the second economy bears witness to the appreciation of the
   `anti-hero' and demonstrates the inception of a new moral economy in
   which the state and the powerful have become targets of legitimate
   predation based on the principle of redistribution.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the appeal of different populist parties in the
   Netherlands should be understood against the backdrop of class dynamics
   in the Dutch economy. Changes in the structure of capital accumulation
   have led to a rise in precarious working conditions, and real estate
   increasingly functions as an investment opportunity, causing housing
   prices to skyrocket. The resulting political-economic crisis dynamic
   constitutes fruitful ground for populist opposition voices. Adopting
   Ernesto Laclau's framework, the article analyzes the 2021 election
   programs of three populist parties to trace the contingent articulations
   of economic demands in wider constructions of ``the people.{''} Radical
   right-wing populist parties, such as Partij voor de Vrijheid and Forum
   voor Democratie articulate class demands as part of broader populist
   projects based on xenophobic exclusions or ``globalist{''} conspiracy
   theories. On the left, the Socialist Party constructs a more classical
   opposition between workers and capitalists. The article is theoretically
   innovative insofar as it shows how populist reason and contingent class
   dynamics can be considered from a comprehensive perspective.},

Abstract = {The reliability of sources presents a major obstacle to the history of
   military opposition. The paucity of direct sources necessitates the use
   of police archives, or literary reconstructions like that of Charles
   Nodier. But only a number of historians acknowledge the existence of a
   ``conspiracy novel{''}-a ``fact{''} that accords too much importance to
   direct testimony. To reopen this field of research, I propose using
   individual case studies-here, the example of the sejour of general
   Argoud on the island of Oleron in 1802. By comparing the reports of
   administrative authorities, police sources, the personal dossier of the
   General, with those of other military figures of the period on the
   island, one can trace the portrait of an anti-notable, whose traits are
   negative compared with the social image that the Bonapartist regime
   tried to mould of the superior officer. This portrait that can be
   compared with that of other military opponents of the regime raises
   other questions, most notably that of the nature of the regime being
   opposed.},

Pages = {88-100},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As the millennium approaches, the wave of antimodernism that has brought
   violent movements of religious nationalism in its wake around the world
   has arrived at America's shores. In the United States, attacks on
   abortion clinics, the killing of abortion clinic staff, and the
   destructive acts of members of Christian militia movements are chilling
   examples of assaults on the legitimacy of modern social and political
   institutions, based on the theological frameworks of reconstruction
   theology and Christian Identity thinking. These examples of Christian
   militancy present a religious perception of warfare and struggle in what
   is perhaps the most modern of twentieth-century societies. The secular
   political order of America is imagined to be trapped in vast satanic
   conspiracies involving spiritual and personal control. This perception
   provides Christian activists with both the justification and the
   obligation to use violent means to fulfill their understanding of the
   country's Christian mission-and at the same time offers a formidable
   critique of Enlightenment society and a reassertion of the primacy of
   religion in public life.},

   transformation of resource-based enterprises: A principal-agent
   perspective},
Journal = {SYSTEMS ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 2},
Abstract = {In this work, by constructing a principal-agent model, we analyze the
   intrinsic causes of collusion between the government and enterprises,
   particularly through the central and local governments and
   resource-based enterprises. The analysis has been conducted by
   introducing the public as a third-party monitoring body to explore the
   positive role of public participation in preventing collusion between
   the government and enterprises, and henceforth entailing model analysis
   and validation with certain examples. The green transformation of
   resource-based enterprises is an effective way for their sustainable
   development, besides being an inevitable requirement for China's
   high-quality economic development and ecological civilization
   construction in the new era. In this perspective, our study reveals
   that: (1) Government-enterprise collusion is motivated by the central
   government's improper assessment and incentive mechanism, besides the
   information deficit between the central government and the colluding
   parties. (2) The conditions for government-enterprise collusion in
   development remain on the resource-based enterprises and local
   governments that face fewer expected penalties than expected benefits,
   thus resulting in lower collusion risks. (3) Public participation in
   monitoring can effectively combat the willingness of the local
   governments and resource-based enterprises to collude and significantly
   increase the level of effort of both parties in the green transition.
   (4) Public monitoring increases the probability of collusion detection,
   and prompt detection improves the timeliness and effectiveness of
   punishment. The findings from this study can provide a scientific basis
   for improving the regulatory system, thus improving public participation
   and strengthening the penal system.},

Abstract = {The study unpacks some of the frames of reference that people use to
   explain and understand Covid-19 in Zimbabwe. The study used a
   qualitative research approach to explore participants' frames of
   reference. A phenomenological research design was adopted. Purposive
   sampling was used to select research participants, whilst two online
   focus group discussions were held. Data were collected through the use
   of semi-structured interview questions, which were administered online.
   The study revealed five salient themes as frames of reference, each with
   its own sub-themes. These are religion, politics, race, the rural-urban
   dichotomy, and age. The study concluded that people use their frames of
   reference to understand pandemics. Certain myths about Covid-19 emanate
   from people's frames of reference, without any scientific basis. It was
   also noted that frames of reference give rise to the construction and
   perpetuation of misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories.
   It is recommended that stakeholders take a systematic and integrated
   approach which appeals to all people's frames of reference when
   disseminating information.},

Abstract = {Armand-Marc comte de Montmorin (1746-1792) was the last foreign minister
   (1787-1789) of the old regime and the first of the constitutional
   monarchy (1789-1791). Descended from a prominent Auvergnat aristocratic
   family, he held a very close relationship with the dauphin who became
   king in 1774. Montmorin's diplomatic career began with royal support,
   first as minister to Treves (1775-1778), then as ambassador to Madrid
   (1778-1784). In 1787, Louis XVI named him to head the foreign ministry
   as successor to the comte de Vergennes. The outbreak of revolution led
   to his involvement in domestic affairs. He dedicated his life after 1789
   to saving the Crown, urging the royal couple to adopt the newly emerging
   constitution. Montmorin resigned his office in October 1791; thereafter,
   he was engaged in various conspiracies. In August 1792, following the
   overthrow of the monarchy, the Legislative Assembly arrested, tried and
   convicted him of treason. Held in l'Abbaye prison, he was one of those
   massacred on September 2. His late career provides a unique window into
   the chaos and confusion of the early Revolution},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that the A/(A) over bar distinction is an
   epiphenomenon that emerges from independently necessary properties of
   Merge and the interpretive components. A true explanation of the A/(A)
   over bar distinction requires that the distinction between the two
   classes of structures must emerge from a conspiracy of independently
   motivated principles and that the distinction should explain why the
   contrasts between A- and A-constructions are precisely the ones they
   are. I argue that certain moved constituents must be structurally
   altered on the way to their landing sites; otherwise, they will
   interfere with Case and agreement relations. I propose that an optional
   instance of Merge, late attachment of a prepositional head to the moved
   DP, insulates that DP from Case and agreement, but has consequences for
   what an insulated DP can antecede and/or license. Insulation is
   optional, but limited by independently motivated interface requirements
   that determine its distribution. The distribution of insulation explains
   why A- and (A) over bar -structures differ in just the ways they do and
   not in other ways.},

Abstract = {Margaret Murray (1863-1963) was a major figure in the creation of
   professional archaeology, president of the Folklore Society, and
   advocate for women's rights. Her popular legacy today is the concept of
   the ``witch-cult,{''} a hidden ancient religion persecuted as
   witchcraft. Murray's witch-cult not only inspired Neopaganism but is
   foundational for author H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. These modern
   myths cast a long shadow on not only fantastical literature but on
   paranormal beliefs, preserving outdated elements of Victorian
   archaeology in popular culture concerned with alternative archaeology
   and the occult.},

Title = {DO COLLEGE ATHLETES GET NIL? UNREASONABLE RESTRAINTS ON PLAYER ACCESS TO
   SPORTS BRANDING MARKETS},
Journal = {UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-104},
Abstract = {Name, image, and likeness ({''}NIL{''}) laws for college athletes have
   replaced the NCAA's amateurism model. While they improve athletes'
   economic rights, the twenty-five state NIL laws in my study show that
   pay restrictions vary widely. New Mexico has four pay restrictions
   compared to forty-five in Illinois. Common restrictions protect a
   school's intellectual property rights, authorize schools to approve NIL
   deals, and prohibit certain athlete activities and sponsorships.
   Many restrictions advance a reasonable institutional interest, but
   Illinois and Mississippi over-regulate NIL rights. Their laws authorize
   schools to be paid market value as a condition for approving an
   athlete's use of school marks and logos. Illinois and Mississippi also
   bar athletes and NIL sponsors from suing schools for unfair competition
   and business torts.
   Division I universities in Illinois are the most vulnerable schools for
   an antitrust test case. Using athletic department revenue data from
   seven public schools (2016-2019), I show that they had sluggish revenue
   growth for corporate sponsorships, advertising, and licensed products.
   This constitutes a relevant market in which athletes compete directly
   against schools for NIL deals. Furthermore, these schools behaved like a
   market-restricting conspiracy by holding private meetings to draft the
   nation's most restrictive NIL law. Former NCAA athletes at Illinois and
   Northwestern who are now state lawmakers advanced this school conspiracy
   by amending a K-12 school truancy bill to introduce the Student-Athlete
   Endorsement Rights Act. The law unreasonably protects these schools'
   licensing and sponsorship markets-a conclusion supported by comparisons
   to other states and demonstrated by applying an antitrust analysis to
   Illinois's most severe restraints on athlete pay.
   My analysis relates to player antitrust litigation that began in the
   1970s. The NCAA and schools prevailed in these lawsuits for decades.
   But, O'Bannon v. NCAA, 802 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir. 2015), and NCAA v.
   Alston, 141 S. Ct. 2141 (2021), turned this tide in favor of athletes.
   Illinois's Student-Athlete Endorsement Rights Act ignores this seismic
   shift in litigation while legislating NIL rights that provide nil access
   to courts to enforce them.
   Overall, my study shows that most state NIL laws advance economic rights
   for college athletes. But half the states have no NIL laws. I recommend
   that lawmakers in states with NIL laws scale back the most onerous
   restrictions for pay. Unless a federal NIL law is enacted, this
   state-law hodgepodge means that schools will compete for athletes on
   uneven terms, further destabilizing athletic competition between NCAA
   Division I schools.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that ignorance, rather than being a result or
   representation of false beliefs or misinformation, is a compensatory
   epistemic adaptation of complex rhetoric systems. A rhetoric system is
   here defined as a set of interconnected rhetorical elements (beliefs,
   arguments, commonplaces {[}loci communes], meanings, and texts) that
   cohere into a self-organized system that is thoroughly ``about{''} its
   contexts-meaning that its own boundaries and relations are both
   constrained and enabled by the contexts in which it exists. Ignorance,
   as described here, is epistemic management that preserves the boundaries
   and relations of a rhetoric system, and is a way of dealing with
   information that runs counter to one's beliefs. Ignorance is also
   productive, in that it produces new knowledge that works to make
   rhetoric systems more resistant to potential destabilization. To
   elaborate these points, the paper examines discourse about the
   phenomenon of global climate change, which illustrates how individuals
   productively counter information as a way of preserving beliefs. As the
   paper argues, ignorance is neither a cognitive nor epistemological
   failure, but rather is a result of the dynamic and continuous process of
   enforcing epistemic and rhetorical boundaries.},

Abstract = {Three predominant explanations have been offered for the success of
   Donald Trump: first, that increased Republican support was based on a
   backlash against Democratic centrists and ``elites{''} who had abandoned
   the working class by advocating neoliberal economic policies; second,
   that Trump and his supporters used racism, sexism, xenophobia and other
   ``dog whistles{''} to create a backlash among white voters; and third,
   that support for Trump was based on misinformation, conspiracy theories,
   and propaganda promoted by various media and online outlets. While all
   three interpretations reflect some degree of accuracy, the common
   threads are that Trump supporters are seen as victims or underdogs,
   struggling against powerful ``top dogs{''} who pose an existential
   threat to their livelihoods, culture, and social standing. In this
   article, we first address this question of underdogs versus top dogs,
   using the framework presented by William Dugger and other
   institutionalist economics to describe the consequences of liberal
   capitalism. We then ask whether these categories of ``elite{''} and
   ``populist{''} are mutually exclusive and all inclusive. We conclude by
   offering some thoughts on whether use of this terminology has muddled
   the basic understanding of the economic transformation that the United
   States is experiencing at this present time.},

Abstract = {The robbery of Viennese shoe manufacturer Josef Merstallinger on 4 July
   1882 led to a political trial of social radicals the following year.
   When Merstallinger's assailants were arrested, they admitted to the
   crime and professed to have carried it out to raise funds for the
   radical socialist movement. In response, the police arrested dozens of
   radical activists and eventually charged twenty-nine people with crimes
   including high treason. The authorities, including the chief of the
   Vienna police and state's attorney, characterized the robbery as part of
   an international anarchist conspiracy that threatened violent revolution
   against the basis of Austrian and European civilization. The trial was
   thus intended to cripple the radical organization and demonstrate the
   dangers socialist politics posed to the public. A counternarrative for
   the defendants stressed the relative harmlessness of the radical
   movement, general harmony of Austrian social relations, and rights of
   the accused to free speech and to protection from arbitrary treatment by
   the police. A public jury trial suggested the greater persuasiveness of
   the latter narrative, as the jury acquitted the defendants of all
   charges except those directly related to the robbery.},

Title = {Considering attitudinal uncertainty in the climate change skepticism
   continuum},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this paper we present an empirically driven language to discuss
   climate change skepticism. We conceptualize skeptic/skepticism as an
   umbrella term that includes those who actively reject climate science
   and those who are uncertain about climate change. We propose four
   categories for better empirical analysis of climate skepticism:
   epistemic deniers, epistemic doubters (borrowing from Capstick and
   Pidgeon 2014), attribution deniers, and attribution doubters (borrowing
   from Rahmstorf 2004). Using a unique dataset of surveys (n = 1000) and
   interviews (n = 33) with residents of the U.S. Pacific Northwest who are
   skeptical about climate change, we compare those four groups across
   several predictors and demographic variables (age, race, gender,
   political ideology, religiosity, income, education, and level of trust
   in science) and outcome variables (environmental concern, policy
   support, and conspiracy ideation (adherence to the belief that climate
   change is a ``hoax{''}). We demonstrate the importance of considering
   attitudinal uncertainty in the analysis of climate skepticism by
   providing evidence for the presence of a continuum of thought wherein
   epistemic deniers and attribution doubters make up the two ends of a
   continuum with more complicated distinctions between epistemic doubters
   and attribution deniers.},

Abstract = {Background: Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing
   infectious diseases. Early success brought widespread acceptance and
   mass vaccination campaigns have greatly reduced the incidence of many
   diseases in numerous geographic regions.
   Objectives: To study the perspective of health professionals regard to
   barriers and solution for vaccination program in a district of South
   Kerala.
   Materials and Methods: A qualitative study design was done using free
   listing technique for both barriers and solutions. The data was entered
   into notepad and was transferred to Visual Anthropac software trial
   version. The software helped to generate ten important free lists of
   barriers and solutions with percentage, rank and Smith S value.
   Results: The present study had discussed regarding trust of western
   countries promoting vaccination and conspiracy theories related to them.
   The work of antivaccine lobby globally was debated. The controversy of
   MMR Autism and political will of different countries were deliberated.
   The role of media especially impact social media and internet had paved
   pathway for swift spread of contents.
   Conclusion: Major interventions should be planned systematically by the
   government to address barriers for immunization. Strengthening
   Information education and communication (IEC) over digital media using
   appropriate technology should be engrossed for sustaining vaccine
   coverage.},

Abstract = {Since the Coronavirus health emergency was declared, many are the fake
   news that have circulated around this topic, including rumors,
   conspiracy theories and myths. According to the World Economic Forum,
   fake news is one of the threats in today's societies, since this type of
   information circulates fast and is often inaccurate and misleading.
   Moreover, fake-news are far more shared than evidence-based news among
   social media users and thus, this can potentially lead to decisions that
   do not consider the individual's best interest. Drawing from this
   evidence, the present study aims at comparing the type of tweets and
   Sina Weibo posts regarding COVID-19 that contain either false or
   scientific veracious information from February 6 and 7 of 2020. To that
   end 1923 messages from each social media were retrieved, classified and
   compared. Results from this analysis show that there is more false news
   published and shared on Twitter than in Sina Weibo, at the same time
   science-based evidence is more shared on Twitter than in Weibo but less
   than false news. This stresses the need to find effective practices to
   limit the circulation of false information.},

Abstract = {Who was responsible for the murder of Sennacherib? This question
   fascinated Assyriologists for most of the twentieth century, until a new
   interpretation of an obscure, fragmentary letter convinced many that a
   disenfranchised elder son of Sennacherib, Urad-Mullissu, had hatched the
   conspiracy. Since the (re)publication of this text in 1980 by Simo
   Parpola, near consensus has developed about these events. In this paper
   I reexamine the issue and revive the theory that Esarhaddon,
   Sennacherib's son and successor, may have been behind the assassination,
   rather than his elder brother. I do not question the coherence of
   Parpola's interpretation, but I suggest that the field may place undue
   confidence in a single broken, decontextualized letter. More
   importantly, the evidence implicating Esarhaddon is ample. I extend six
   arguments that point toward Esarhaddon's guilt, most of which are
   derived from Esarhaddon's own account of events in his famous Nineveh A
   inscription. I do not propose that we can establish Esarhaddon's guilt
   conclusively at this remove, but I conclude that the weight of this
   evidence equals, if not surpasses, that which points to a plot concocted
   by Urad-Mullissu.},

Title = {Neutrino diagnostics of ultrahigh energy cosmic ray protons},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {79},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The energy at which cosmic rays from extra-galactic sources begin to
   dominate over those from galactic sources is an important open question
   in astroparticle physics. A natural candidate is the energy at the
   ``ankle{''} in the approximately power-law energy spectrum which is
   indicative of a crossover from a falling galactic component to a flatter
   extra-galactic component. The transition can occur without such
   flattening but this requires some degree of conspiracy of the spectral
   shapes and normalizations of the two components. Nevertheless, it has
   been argued that extra-galactic sources of cosmic ray protons that
   undergo interactions on the CMB can reproduce the energy spectrum below
   the ankle if the crossover energy is as low as the ``second knee{''} in
   the spectrum. This low crossover model is constrained by direct
   measurements by the Pierre Auger Observatory, which indicate a heavier
   composition at these energies. We demonstrate that upper limits on the
   cosmic diffuse neutrino flux provide a complementary constraint on the
   proton fraction in ultra-high energy extra-galactic cosmic rays and
   forthcoming data from IceCube will provide a definitive test of this
   model.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on four strategies of onset reduction employed by a
   single child (4;0-4;14) acquiring Polish: deletion, coalescence,
   metathesis, and gemination. Deletion and coalescence occur in
   word-initial onsets while metathesis and gemination are restricted to
   word-medial position. The data, which constitute an intriguing
   `conspiracy' case (Kisseberth, 1970), are analysed within OPTIMALITY
   THEORY (henceforth, OT; Prince \& Smolensky, 1993/2004; McCarthy \&
   Prince, 1995) in which all surface-true `processes' are motivated
   through the interaction of ranked and violable constraints. The OT
   account makes it possible to envisage the four strategies as different
   surface responses to the undominated {*}COMPLEX(Onset) which militates
   against onset clusters. The choice of a particular strategy as well as
   its restriction to a particular word id position is not random but
   follows from the interplay between {*}COMPLEX(Onset), sonority-based
   syllable structure constraints (Margin Hierarchy, CONTACT LAW),
   context-sensitive markedness constraints (CODA CONDITION,
   {*}Nasal-Fricative) and faithfulness constraints. The present study
   confirms previous sonority-based findings, supplies further evidence for
   universal sonority mechanisms from word-medial clusters, and points to
   the coexistence of child-specific and abstract adult-based phonological
   strategies in the child's system.},

Abstract = {Through an examination of the policing of dissident French refugees in
   London between 1760 and 1790, this article contends that recent
   historians have tended to over-emphasize the reforming nature of the
   Bourbon government in the decades prior to the French Revolution,
   especially under Louis XVI, and overlooked the more repressive and
   `despotic' aspects of the regime. It reveals that the Paris police or
   French secret agents adopted a variety of clandestine methods in their
   attempts to silence dissident exiles, including attempts at kidnap, and
   allegedly murder. As much of this police activity was reported in the
   British press and French printed texts, both before and during the
   French Revolution, and several of the exiles were celebrated writers or
   future revolutionary leaders, it was widely known among informed
   contemporaries. The article therefore contends that the French
   revolutionaries' allegations of despotism and suspicions of monarchic
   conspiracies were more deeply rooted in experience than recent
   historiography has tended to suggest. At the same time, reports of the
   attempts of the `despotic' French government to suppress the activities
   of Frenchmen on British soil helped to reinforce a British national
   identity based on the celebration of the liberties France lacked.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the coverage of the suffrage movement in Scottish
   newspapers during the First World War. Suspension of militant action and
   a re-focus on women's war work did not mean the complete disappearance
   of the suffrage campaign from newspapers. However, while militant and
   non-militant organisations received press coverage for their war work,
   there were also stories associating suffragettes with the peace effortor
   even conspiracies against the state. Volunteers at the Scottish Women's
   Hospitals were approvingly described as suffragettes' but the
   appellation retained negative connotations when used about peace
   campaigners. Brave suffragette battalions' were reported to be arriving
   in France, but at the same time a politician painted the Germans as the
   suffragettes of Europe'. Whilst editors wrote enthusiastically of
   women's contribution to the war effort, jokes about suffragettes
   continued to provide light relief. Editorials made the connection
   between women's war work and achievement of the vote. However, not all
   readers were happy with this point of view, with some correspondents
   attacking what they saw as the suffrage organisations' opportunistic use
   of war work and abandonment of working women.},

Abstract = {Vaccination is an effective public health tool for reducing morbidity
   and mortality caused by infectious diseases. However, increasing numbers
   of parents question the safety of vaccines or refuse to vaccinate their
   children outright. The Internet is playing a significant role in the
   growing voice of the anti-vaccination movement as a growing number of
   people use the Internet to obtain health information, including
   information about vaccines. Given the role the Internet plays in
   providing vaccination-related communication, coupled with limited
   research in this area, this study focused on the social media platform
   Pinterest, analyzing 800 vaccine-related pins through a quantitative
   content analysis. The majority of the pins were anti-vaccine, and most
   were original posts as opposed to repins. Concerns about vaccine safety
   and side effects were oft-repeated themes, as was the concept of
   conspiracy theory. Pro-vaccine pins elicited consistently more
   engagement than anti-vaccine pins. Health educators and public health
   organizations should be aware of these dynamics, since a successful
   health communication campaign should start with an understanding of what
   and how publics communicate about the topic at hand. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {The last deputies to be sent on mission by the National Convention
   received their marching orders in a very specific context, subsequent to
   the Paris uprising of 13 Vendemiaire Year IV. That is why I refer to the
   `missions of Vendemiaire'. They were few in number, the best known being
   Louis-Stanislas Freron, sent to the departements around Marseilles. The
   focus here is on Jacques Reverchon, who carried out an identical mission
   in the greater Lyons area. Their powers were extensive: purging the
   newly elected authorities, rehabilitating the local revolutionary
   officials disarmed in the spring, reenacting the emergency laws
   constraining the emigres and refractory priests. These powers were bound
   to be ambiguous at a time of transition between revolutionary and
   constitutional government; but as an extension of the regime of public
   safety, they kept the balance of decision-making clearly on the side of
   the executive. The ultimate justification of the survival of the
   revolutionary regime was the discovery of a `grand royalist conspiracy'
   with national ramifications (the Companions of Jesus, the Companions of
   the Sun). In the process, these missions bear witness to the
   impossibility of terminating the Revolution and implementing a true
   amnesty.},

Abstract = {Mothers and children are as inseparable as two sides of a coin. Their
   relationship is unique and special, based on love and utmost care.
   However, there is a fixed notion about how an `ideal' and `perfect
   mother' should be in our society, as motherhood is inextricably linked
   to rigid gender roles in typically patriarchal societies. Over the
   years, movies have served as an effective platform to challenge and
   dismantle patriarchal structures, promote gender equality and empower
   women. They have depicted a mother's struggle in society and highlighted
   themes such as discrimination, abuse, suppression, resilience,
   sacrifice, and their journey to self-discovery. Within this paradigm,
   through the movie Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway by Ashima Chibber, the paper
   highlights the struggles of Debika, the central character, who grapples
   with the injustice meted out to her due to the rigid patriarchal mindset
   of her in-laws and the cultural conflicts and conspiracies she is
   subject to in Norway. The paper applies the theories of J.W. Berry, R.W.
   Connell and Sara Ruddick to elucidate the pain and agony of a distraught
   Bengali mother as also her power of endurance, grit and determination in
   a hostile environment.},

Abstract = {This work seeks to analyze the Dostoevsky's criticism of slavophiles and
   westernists ideologies, and how that critical conception is designed as
   a cri-tique of modernity, Russian novelist was convicted for taking part
   in a revolutionary conspiracy against the czar, and this experience as a
   prisoner left deep marks in his literary trajectory. Dostoevsky anchored
   his literary production in a religious vocabu-lary aquired through the
   contact with the Russian peasents while imprisoned. Thus, the writer's
   interpreation regarding the Christianity of the Russian will be vital to
   the composition of his future works and will redefine his political,
   philosophical, religious and artistic positions. Starting from the
   influence of the Pochvennichestvo (the native soil movement),
   considering it the only al ve able to articulate an oposition to
   Slavophilism and Westernism, the novelist will announce his defense of
   the Christianity of the Russian peasant people. Therefore, the native
   soil movement is one of the most important aspects for understanding the
   influence between politics, philosophy, religion and art in the
   Dostoevsky's work. but formulated in the terms of a modern discourse.

Title = {Fact-Checking Practices by Canadian Adults During an Era of
   Misinformation and Disinformation},
Journal = {GLOBAL MEDIA JOURNAL-CANADIAN EDITION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {119-142},
Abstract = {Since 2016, the term ``fake news{''} has become incorrectly synonymous
   with the concepts of misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, and
   even conspiracy theories, leading to the assumption that they are
   interchangeable (Guess \& Lyons, 2020). Fact-checking can be viewed in
   two ways: fact-checking conducted by fact-checking organizations -
   third-party or otherwise - and an independent person fact-checking
   information they have come across, using a fact-checking website, or
   their own methods. We surveyed 99 Canadian adults (aged 18-64) on how
   they define and practice fact-checking using an open-ended, qualitative
   method. The study results reveal that Canadians engage in a diverse
   range of fact-checking behaviors. Specifically, we found 10 distinct
   approaches to fact-checking that are also consistent with how these
   participants defined factchecking, with the most common four being:
   Google and cross-referencing, credibility of source, different
   perspectives, and skeptical/anti-mainstream. The findings of this study
   provide Canadian researchers, educators, and policy makers with a
   greater sense of clarity on the issue of fact-checking practices within
   Canada, and consequently, provide promising practices for how to engage
   in fact-checking.},

Title = {Unraveling non-Hermitian pumping: Emergent spectral singularities and
   anomalous responses},

Abstract = {Within the expanding field of non-Hermitian physics, non-Hermitian
   pumping has emerged as a key phenomenon, epitomized through the skin
   effect via extensive boundary mode accumulation modifying the
   conventional Bloch picture. Beyond redefining bulk-boundary
   correspondences, we show that non-Hermitian pumping induces an
   unprecedented type of spectral topology: It admits a classification in
   terms of graph topology, which is distinct from conventional topological
   classifications of the eigenstate or energy Riemann surface. Each
   topological class is characterized by a conformally invariant
   configuration of spectral branching singularities, with gap-preserving
   transitions giving rise to emergent band geometry and Berry curvature
   discontinuities physically manifested as anomalous response kinks By
   placing all Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattice Hamiltonians on equal
   footing, our comprehensive framework also enables the first analytic
   construction of topological phase diagrams in the presence of multiple
   nonreciprocal coupling scales, as prototypically demonstrated for the
   extended non-Hermitian Chern and Kitaev models. Based on general
   algebraic geometry properties of the energy dispersion, our framework
   can be directly generalized to multiple bands, dimensions, and even
   interacting systems. Overall, it reveals the conspiracy of band
   representations, spectral topology, and complex geometry as it unfolds
   in directly measurable quantities.},

Abstract = {In the case of the riot of the `Bundschuh' in Untergrombach in 1502,
   recent research was able to correct numerous misunderstandings, while
   the real causes of this uproar are still unexplained. A new approach can
   be given by the `Domkapitelsprotokolle', the records of the chapter of
   the cathedral in Speyer. Aside from indications concerning the events in
   the course of the conspiracy, these records describe the requests of
   numerous villages on both banks of the Rhine asking for cash loans, the
   respite of the `Zehnt' and the delivery of grain. These requests are
   directly connected with the impacts of crop failure in 1501 and 1502 and
   they prove the hunger crisis the groups of small peasants and rural
   workers were facing in those villages. Methodically, we try to connect
   the disruptive event itself, i.e. the distress of the common man and the
   partially high demands on the village communities to handle the
   situation, with the reactions of the cathedral chapter of Speyer and to
   assess it by considering in particular the ethical categories of
   `Nahrung' (aliment) and `Notdurft'(necessity) as the oldest sources of
   paternalistic rule. It is to be stated that the chapter's rule failed
   massively.},

Title = {White paranoia: Michael Haneke's <i>Cache</i> reflected through Alain
   Robbe-Grillet's novel <i>La Jalousie</i>},
Journal = {STUDIES IN FRENCH CINEMA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Inspired by Alain Robbe-Grillet's novel La Jalousie (1957), the essay
   contends that Michael Haneke's Cache (2005) takes its viewers inside a
   postcolonial white paranoia which is, arguably, the root cause of the
   exclusion, segregation and racist discrimination that many immigrants
   from the former colonies - and their children - are experiencing in
   contemporary France. It suggests that the entire film be read as the
   protagonist's paranoid vision that imagines white privileges to be
   menaced by some non-white conspiracy. His obsession, which hinges on a
   fear of a reversal of the power inherent in `the gaze', as brought out
   in the central `stalking plot', informs the entire film's narration and
   audiovisual make-up and explains, among other things, the serial
   repetitions and variations of certain settings and objects as the
   protagonist's desperate attempt to create order in a threatening world.
   The construction of the film, however, also allows Haneke to critically
   comment upon his protagonist's paranoia and demonstrate its
   ill-foundedness, for instance by pointing to a possible `banal
   conviviality' (Paul Gilroy) between people of different ethnicities,
   cultures and religions.},

Abstract = {If historiography is ordered by a series of thematic and methodological
   turns, then it is not hard to demonstrate that there has in recent years
   been a turn towards revolutionary histories of South Asia. Scholars have
   begun to transcend the limitations of Gandhian frameworks in search of
   more dynamic understandings of Indian pasts that factor in the role of
   violence, subterfuge and conspiracy in South Asian anti-colonial
   struggles. But what happens when new methodologies and narratives begin
   to destabilise or even invert longstanding historical readings that have
   been the basis for generations of academic knowledge of the past? When,
   and under what political and institutional conditions, are fresh
   interpretations of history sayable? Can historical trajectories or
   interpretations be quickly turned or must they evolve slowly? This paper
   is a self-reflexive critique of the ways in which radical histories
   canor cannotbe written in the post-colonial moment, with reference to
   the compulsions brought to bear in the writing of revolutionary history.
   This article considers these historiographical issues alongside
   compelling evidence of the involvement of Jawaharlal and Motilal Nehru
   in key aspects of the revolutionary actions of the Hindustan Socialist
   Republican Association.},

Journal = {IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {A trusted third party (TTP) is introduced to the buyer-seller protocol
   to guarantee the transaction fairness in protocol. However, the TTP
   practically increases the cost in the buyer-seller protocol. To address
   this issue, we propose a novel buyer-seller watermarking protocol to
   eliminate the need for a TTP. By dividing the buyer's secret key into
   two primary mechanisms: the buyer's watermark, embedded in digital
   content, and the transaction number produced by the seller; the seller
   can verify buyer's watermark without decryption. After inserting a
   digital watermark from the seller, the buyer cannot remove the watermark
   from the digital content without a watermark extraction algorithm. The
   seller cannot fabricate piracy to frame an innocent buyer. When piracy
   is found, it can be traced clearly because of the privacy homomorphism
   property. In other words, the proposed protocol can trace piracy and
   protect the customer's rights without a TTP. Therefore, the conspiracy
   problem can be solved. The proposed protocol also can protect the
   anonymity of the buyer and bind the buyer's watermark to digital
   content. Moreover, the buyer is no longer required to participate in the
   dispute resolution in our scheme.},

Abstract = {The article reviews social context of repressions during the Great
   Purge. The main focus is made on the specific features of terror's
   events, specifically - on the interpretation of social ties as a basis
   of ``counter-revolutionary organizations{''}. This interpretation turned
   prisoners' relationships with neighbors, colleagues and personal friends
   into acts of conspiracy.
   The author proves the struggle of the government against informal ties
   between participants of political, economical and cultural institutions.
   Political campaign against ``clans{''}, `` workingmen's cooperatives{''}
   etc. served as a basis for social politics of RCP(b) and AUCP(b) in the
   1920s-1930s. The Great Purge was aimed to deconstruct existed both
   professional and personal social relationships between Soviet citizens.
   It was a basis for production of atomized individuals and as cogs in
   state's machine.
   The destruction of existing social ties allowed the power to organize
   new social politics aimed to organize the society into productive
   ``collectivity{''}. Pressure against other forms of association whether
   they were territorial, based on friendship and even kinship, was
   proclaimed to be the war against ``gruppovschina{''}. The purpose of
   total collectivization of the society required terror and repressions.},

Title = {The Role of Ideological Discourse in Genocidal Mobilization in the XX
   Century},
Journal = {STUDIA SOCJOLOGICZNE},
Year = {2012},
Number = {1},
Pages = {177-198},
Abstract = {Aside from it being a crime, genocide is a very important subject of
   social sciences. The aim of the paper is to prove the thesis, that
   ideological discourses (not: ideologies) are an important part of
   genocidal mobilization. Ideological discourse establishes not only
   cultural myths (the codes of popular culture) that define what is normal
   in social life, but also institutions, habituses, social roles, etc.
   Therefore discourse plays direct and indirect role in mobilization. This
   article is based on critical discourse analysis theory, historical
   sociology paradigm and genocide studies. Legal definition of genocide
   does not easily lend itself to empirical and historical research.
   Therefore the author proposes the new definition of genocide and the
   list of genocides. There are seven main ideological discourses, which
   spurred genocidal mobilization in the XX century: (1) nationalist
   discourse, (2) Realpolitik discourse, (3) racist discourse, (4)
   medical/epidemiological discourse, (5) fundamentalist religious
   discourse, (6) conspiracy discourse and (7) discourse of usefulness and
   parasitism. These discourses are constructed as social texts and
   immediately translated into social constructs. The paper explores these
   discourses, that were crucial for the formation of modern genocides.},

Abstract = {One possible fate of information lost to black holes is its preservation
   in black hole remnants. It is argued that a type of effective field
   theory describes such remnants (generically referred to as informons).
   The general structure of such a theory is investigated and the infinite
   pair production problem is revisited. A toy model for remnants clarifies
   some of the basic issues; in particular, infinite remnant production is
   not suppressed simply by the large internal volumes as proposed in
   cornucopion scenarios. Criteria for avoiding infinite production are
   stated in terms of couplings in the effective theory. Such instabilities
   remain a problem barring what would be described in that theory as a
   strong coupling conspiracy. The relation to Euclidean calculations of
   cornucopion production is sketched, and potential flaws in that analysis
   are outlined. However, it is quite plausible that pair production of
   ordinary black holes (e.g., Reissner-Nordstrom or others) is suppressed
   due to strong effective couplings. It also remains an open possibility
   that a microsopic dynamics can be found yielding an appropriate strongly
   coupled effective theory of neutral informons without infinite pair
   production.},

Abstract = {This article discusses Article 6 of the International Law Commission's
   (ILC) draft articles on crimes against humanity, which deals with
   criminalization of crimes against humanity in national law. The
   provision uses neutral and generic terms to describe criminal
   responsibility. This is appropriate for a treaty like the one which
   could result from the ILC articles, where it would be left to state
   parties to enact legislation and to align criminal responsibility for
   crimes against humanity to existing legal concepts in domestic law.
   Article 6 is a broad provision, yet it leaves a few gaps. This
   contribution suggests the insertion and explicit recognition of
   conspiracy as entailing criminal responsibility for crimes against
   humanity. Moreover, it proposes a modification of the superior orders
   defence, allowing reliance on the defence for non-manifestly unlawful
   orders. The clause on liability of legal persons is welcomed, whereas
   the provision on superior responsibility is criticized. The latter,
   mirroring Article 28 of the International Criminal Court's (ICC)
   Statute, is at the moment vague and unclear. Thus, drafters are
   encouraged to adopt a `splitting solution', recognizing a number of
   separate superior responsibility concepts.},

Abstract = {Purpose - People with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are known to have
   difficulties in their social communication and interaction. The internet
   is a twenty-first century phenomenon that provides such individuals with
   a world in which they can exist without the awkwardness of face-to-face
   contact. The purpose of this paper is to start to illustrate the high
   risks that can occur when the internet is used as the main forum for
   interaction in individuals who are socially impaired.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides a brief summary of
   literature in relation to ASD and risk of offending behaviour followed
   by a case study of a young man with a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome who
   was convicted of conspiracy to murder.
   Findings - This paper concludes that possible deficits in central
   coherence, theory of mind and social skills, combined with extensive
   periods of time spent alone on the internet forums and a late diagnosis
   of ASD, may place individuals at risk of committing a serious offence.
   Originality/value - This paper highlights the difficulties that people
   with Autism may have in separating fantasy from reality and the high
   level of risk that can occur as a result.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we advance a new approach to the intergenerational
   transmission of Holocaust experiences, by focusing on attachment theory.
   The approach is used as a framework for interpretation of the results of
   three studies on Holocaust survivors and their offspring, from different
   countries (The Netherlands, Canada, and Israel), and based on different
   conceptual approaches and methods of data collection (quantitative as
   well as qualitative). The literature is divided with regard to the
   extent and depth of long-term effects of the Holocaust. Attachment
   theory allows the integration of the phenomena of attachment,
   separation, and loss, which appear to be core concepts in the three
   studies presented here. The notion of insecure-ambivalent attachment
   sheds some light on the observed preoccupation with issues of attachment
   and separation in the second generation. Furthermore, the theme of ``the
   conspiracy of silence{''} is discussed in the context of attachment
   disorganisation. Attachment theory transcends the traditional boundaries
   between clinical and nonclinical interpretations, in stressing the
   continuous and cumulative nature of favourable and unfavourable
   child-rearing circumstances. In this context, insecure attachment should
   be regarded as coping with suboptimal childrearing environments.},

Abstract = {Using a sample of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2007 to 2020, we
   explore the impact of common institutional owners on M \& A activities.
   Our results strongly support the ``synergy governance{''} view,
   according to which common institutional owners perform more actively and
   effectively in monitoring against bad M \& As and improving M \& A
   quality, especially for investors who have closer peer linkages, greater
   industry power, and longer-term holdings. The mechanism test finds that
   in firms with poorer information environment, vaguer industry
   information and lower governance level, common institutional owners have
   a more significant inhibitory effect on bad M \& As, confirming that
   they do have information advantages and supervisory advantages. Overall,
   our research explores the positive side of common institutional
   investors.},

Pages = {121-145},
Abstract = {This article deals with Habsburg efforts to eliminate the Ottoman naval
   threat by employing clandestine measures and undertaking covert
   operations. Realizing the danger that the Ottoman fleet and corsairs
   created for their defenses, the Habsburg secret service dispatched a
   number of go-betweens in order to remind Uluc Ali of his Christian past
   and obligations to his true monarch and thus convince him to switch
   allegiances. The Habsburgs also tried to arrange the assassination of
   this dangerous corsair who reached the zenith of his power as the
   Ottoman Grand Admiral. While the efficiency of Habsburg secret service
   demonstrate us the strength of circum-Mediterranean information
   gathering mechanisms and epistolary networks, the attempts of
   assassination and defection point to an understudied aspect of
   inter-imperial rivalries: secret diplomacy.},

Abstract = {Conservative religious ideologies have been linked to vaccine hesitancy.
   Yet, little is known about how paranormal beliefs relate to vaccine
   confidence and uptake. We hypothesize that paranormal beliefs will be
   negatively related to both confidence and uptake due to their
   association with lower levels of trust in science and a greater
   acceptance of conspiratorial beliefs. We test this hypothesis using a
   new nationally representative sample of U.S. adults fielded in May and
   June of 2021 by NORC. Using regression models with a sample of 1,734, we
   find that paranormal beliefs are negatively associated with general
   vaccine confidence, COVID-19 vaccine confidence, and COVID-19 vaccine
   uptake. These associations are partially or fully attenuated net of
   trust in science and conspiratorial belief. Although not a focus of the
   study, we also find that Christian nationalism's negative association
   with the outcomes is fully accounted for by measures of trust in science
   and conspiratorial beliefs.},

Abstract = {Judges are increasingly using ``implicit bias{''} instructions in jury
   trials in an effort to reduce the influence of jurors' biases on
   judgment. In this article, we report on findings from a large-scale mock
   jury study that tests the impact of implicit bias instructions on
   judgment in a case where defendant race was varied (Black or White).
   Using an experimental design, we collected and analyzed quantitative and
   qualitative data at the individual and group levels obtained from 120
   small groups who viewed a simulated federal drug conspiracy trial and
   then deliberated to determine a verdict. We find that while participants
   were sensitized to the importance of being unbiased, implicit bias
   instructions had no measurable impact on verdict outcomes relative to
   the standard instructions. Our analysis of the deliberations, however,
   reveals that those who heard the implicit bias instructions were more
   likely to discuss the issue of bias, potentially with both ameliorative
   and harmful effects on the defendant. Most significantly, we identified
   multiple instances where, in an effort to avoid bias, participants who
   heard the implicit bias instructions interfered with their own or other
   participants' appropriate assessments of witness credibility.},

Abstract = {Thomas More's Utopia, a book that will be 500 years old next year, is
   astonishingly radical stuff. Not many lord chancellors of England have
   denounced private property, advocated a form of communism and described
   the current social order as a ``conspiracy of the rich.{''} Such men,
   the book announces, are ``greedy, unscrupulous and useless.{''} There
   are a great number of noblemen, More complains, who live like drones on
   the labour of others. Tenants are evicted so that ``one insatiable
   glutton and accursed plague of his native land{''} may consolidate his
   fields. Monarchs, he argues, would do well to swear at their
   inauguration never to have more than 1,000lbs of gold in their coffers.
   Perhaps this is one reason why Utopia is not bedside reading in
   Buckingham Palace. Instead of being worshipped, gold and silver should,
   he suggests, be used to make chamber pots. War is fit only for beasts,
   and standing armies should be disbanded. Labour should be reduced to a
   minimum, though the TUC might balk at the suggestion that workers would
   use some of their leisure time to attend public lectures before
   daybreak.},

Title = {``Who will take the blame?{''}: Understanding the reasons why Romanian
   mothers decline HPV vaccination for their daughters},
Journal = {VACCINE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {30},
Number = {48},
Pages = {6789-6793},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {Because Romania has the highest incidence of cervical cancer in Europe,
   in 2008 a HPV vaccination campaign was introduced targeting 10-11 year
   old girls. However, only 2.5\% of the eligible girls were given parental
   for vaccination. Campaign failure makes it important to look for
   possible reasons and investigate mothers' attitudes and perceptions of
   the HPV vaccine. Three focus groups and 11 interviews were conducted
   with mothers from urban areas. Data were transcribed verbatim and
   analysed with thematic analysis.
   Results show as main reasons for not vaccinating their daughters
   perceiving the vaccine as risky, the belief that the vaccine represents
   an experiment that uses their daughters as guinea pigs, the belief that
   the vaccine embodies a conspiracy theory that aims to reduce the world's
   population and general mistrust in the ineffective health system.
   Mothers stated they would need clear, factual information about the HPV
   vaccine and its link to cervical cancer in order to motivate them to
   accept it for their daughters.
   The study offers insight into the beliefs and attitudes towards the
   vaccine and provides ideas for structuring future health communication
   campaigns regarding the HPV vaccine. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic, and the social and economic instability that
   followed, has given new life to conspirituality and far-right ideology
   in so-called Australia. This article discusses how politico-spiritual
   communities invested in both conspiracy theories and New Age
   spirituality have pieced together settler narratives about a New World
   Order and external threats to Western society from far-right and white
   supremacist Christian ideology circulated via new media. Using
   anti-colonial discourse analysis, we elucidate the undercurrent of white
   supremacist ideology in the Australian anti-vax movement, and highlight
   the misuse of Indigeneity in far-right and anti-vax narratives. We
   discuss how these narratives are settler-colonial and how
   conspiritualists co-opt and perform Indigeneity as a form of settler
   nativism. As a case study, we analyse the use of the term sovereignty by
   settlers attached to Muckadda Camp-a camp of `Original Sovereigns'
   occupying the lawn outside Old Parliament house from December 2021 to
   February 2022. Using Indigenous critique from both new media and
   academia, we argue that although settlers may perform Indigeneity, they
   are exercising white supremacist settler narratives, and not Indigenous
   sovereignty.},

Abstract = {Denial and conspiracy theorist ideas also find room in the field of
   history. This is what we today call pseudo-history, which is generally
   undertaken by people without methodological training in the historical
   field and often inspired by political and/or religious prejudice. This
   article examines the arguments presented by a non-academic
   pseudo-historical trend in Valencia, which denies the process of
   migration, repopulation and colonisation of the Kingdom of Valencia,
   founded by King James I in the 13th century, after the conquest of Sarq
   al Andalus by Catalonia and Aragon. They argue for the social, human,
   cultural and linguistic continuity of a `Valencian people and language'
   dating back to the Iberian and Roman periods, which during the Andalusi
   period remained as a `Mozarab' majority that acted as a transmission
   belt for this Christian people and language to the 21st century. The
   text examines two works written by different authors, and flags out
   their inconsistencies, lack of basic knowledge of medieval history and
   frequent internal contradictions, and emphasises the total lack of
   evidence, both written and archaeological, for their arguments, which
   are as a rule dismissed with expressions such as `it is easier to think
   that...'(1).},

Abstract = {Social media is internet-based technology and an electronic form of
   communication that facilitates sharing of ideas, documents, and personal
   information. Twitter is a microblogging platform and is the most
   effective social service for posting microblogs and likings, commenting,
   sharing, and communicating with others. The problem we are shedding
   light on in this paper is the misuse of bots on Twitter. The purpose of
   bots is to automate specific repetitive tasks instead of human
   interaction. However, bots are misused to influence people's minds by
   spreading rumors and conspiracy related to controversial topics. In this
   paper, we initiate a new benchmark created on a 1.5M Twitter profile. We
   train different supervised machine learning on our benchmark to detect
   bots on Twitter. In addition to increasing benchmark scalability,
   various autofeature selections are utilized to identify the most
   influential features and remove the less influential ones. Furthermore,
   over-/ under-sampling is applied to reduce the imbalance effect on the
   benchmark. Finally, our benchmark compared with other stateof-the-art
   benchmarks and achieved a 6\% higher area under the curve than other
   datasets in the case of generalization, improving the model performance
   by at least 2\% by applying over-/undersampling.},

Abstract = {Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brasilian government
   has undergone a significant political dispute over the use of
   hydroxychloroquine as a measure to confront the disease and contested
   scientific and healthcare organisations findings related to the drug's
   effectiveness. In this article, we seek to understand the manner in
   which an illiberal populist government and the supporters thereof refer
   to scientific discourse during the pandemic, with a focus on the debates
   on Brasilian far-right networks on Twitter. Using a mixed methodology
   with statistical methods, social media analysis, natural language
   processing and qualitative content analysis, this study seeks to
   investigate which sources and stakeholders were referenced and the
   narratives that structured the arguments of far-right supporters who
   defended the use of hydroxychloroquine. The results highlight the use of
   sources that are ideologically aligned to the right and a
   reconfiguration of scientific authority that was supported by illiberal
   values. Among the main discourses, we observed an epistemic challenge
   with a partisan bias, which led to the scientific authority legitimising
   some arguments and discrediting others. We also identified the spread of
   conspiracy theories that reflected the epistemic challenge, in addition
   to conservative, revivalist and individualistic postures.},

Title = {Climate Change Denial among Radical Right-Wing Supporters},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {The linkage between political right-wing orientation and climate change
   denial is extensively studied. However, previous research has almost
   exclusively focused on the mainstream right, which differs from the far
   right (radical and extreme) in some important domains. Thus, we
   investigated correlates of climate change denial among supporters of a
   radical right-wing party (Sweden Democrats, N = 2216), a mainstream
   right-wing party (the Conservative Party, Moderaterna, N = 634), and a
   mainstream center-left party (Social Democrats, N = 548) in Sweden.
   Across the analyses, distrust of public service media (Swedish
   Television, SVT), socioeconomic right-wing attitudes, and antifeminist
   attitudes outperformed the effects of anti-immigration attitudes and
   political distrust in explaining climate change denial, perhaps because
   of a lesser distinguishing capability of the latter mentioned variables.
   For example, virtually all Sweden Democrat supporters oppose
   immigration. Furthermore, the effects of party support, conservative
   ideologies, and belief in conspiracies were relatively weak, and
   vanished or substantially weakened in the full models. Our results
   suggest that socioeconomic attitudes (characteristic for the mainstream
   right) and exclusionary sociocultural attitudes and institutional
   distrust (characteristic for the contemporary European radical right)
   are important predictors of climate change denial, and more important
   than party support per se.},

Abstract = {December 21, 2018, marked the 30th anniversary of the Lockerbie Air
   Disaster. Despite this lengthy passage of time, the case remains highly
   contentious and active. A quick search on the topic reveals a host of
   possible conspiracy theories and cover-ups, many conflicting narratives
   and possibilities, and, for many, a strong feeling that the sentencing
   of Abdelbasset al-Megrahi represented a miscarriage of justice. While
   there have been many political books and articles on Lockerbie,
   surprisingly to date there have been no scholarly papers on its literary
   representations. This article, therefore, considers the ways in which
   the Lockerbie Air Disaster has been considered in fiction, drama, and
   poetry since 1988, surveying what has been published, as well as
   examining some of the motivations behind these. As will be demonstrated,
   some common threads run through these literary texts: namely, a
   frustration with the slowness of the ongoing criminal case and the
   perception that justice has still to be served. As will be demonstrated,
   many of the Lockerbie texts therefore contain inherent, politically
   charged provocations, sending out reminders that many aspects of the
   case have still to be accounted for in the public domain.},

Title = {Secure Information Sharing System for Online Patient Networks},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2019},
Abstract = {Recently, privacy emerged as a hot issue again, as the General Data
   Protection Regulation (GDPR) of EU has become enforceable since May 25,
   2018. This paper deals with the problem of health information sharing on
   a website securely and with preserving privacy. In the context of
   patient networks (such as PatientsLikeMe' or CureTogether'), we propose
   the model Secure Information Sharing System (SISS) with the main method
   of group key cryptosystem. SISS addresses important problems of group
   key systems. (1) The new developed equations for encryption and
   decryption can eliminate the rekeying and redistribution process for
   every membership-change of the group, keeping the security requirements.
   (2) The new 3D Stereoscopic Image Mobile Security Technology with AR
   (augmented reality) solves the problem of conspiracy by group members.
   (3) SISS uses the reversed one-way hash chain to guarantee forward
   secrecy and backward accessibility (security requirements for
   information sharing in a group). We conduct a security analysis of SISS
   according to group information sharing secrecy and an experiment on its
   performance. Consequently, although current IT paradigm is changing to
   be more and more complicated', overlapped', and virtualized', SISS makes
   it possible to securely share sensitive information from collaborative
   work.},

Number = {3},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to verbal crimes, the qualification of which
   requires the cooperation of lawyers and linguists. Linguists are
   directly involved into qualification of verbal crimes such as
   conspiracy, incitement, threat, insult, etc. The use of language always
   contains the potential of ``natural insult{''}, a violation of
   conventional rules. This violation effects not the same perlocutionary
   result. The legal definition of insult is essentially an appeal to
   linguistic flair. Insult is mostly associated with the use of a
   particular obscene (invective) lexicon. Any media text that contains
   allegations about people or institutions can be challenged in court,
   that is, it can be considered as an insult. Therefore, any media text
   that is not initially intended as a conflict can cause a conflict. This
   is supported by the language itself. The specificity of the studied
   problem area led to the hermeneutic approach, focused on interpretation
   and explanation; the method of linguistic deduction and induction.
   Interpretative approach, based on the assumption that the values do not
   exist in isolation, are not contained in words and sentences, not
   extracted from them, but understood by the recipient on the basis of the
   speech features and context, was extremely relevant.},

Abstract = {Truth claims pervade the world: assertions that a speaker wishes to
   persuade an audience are true or at least plausible. But how to judge?
   Much proposed knowledge has uncertain legitimacy, evaluated through
   assumptions of how the world operates or by the reputation of its
   sponsor. In other words, plausibility and credibility shape our
   judgments. As students of conspiracy theories recognize, many
   ``facts{''} are available, too many to be easily judged as to their
   accuracy. Facts are promiscuous. As judges of likelihood, we conclude
   that some are false, others true, and still others taken out of context.
   Further, knowledge is never complete and so we must consider error and
   ignorance (a field of epistemology labeled agnotology) as well as
   accuracy and awareness. In this article I examine four critical
   allegations made about United States President Barack Obama: that he was
   born in Kenya, that he is Muslim, that he engaged in oral sex with
   another man, and that he is a socialist. While each of these claims may
   be false, they are false in different ways in light of the different
   criteria and strategies by which we weigh uncertainty.},

Title = {Security and Cross-Border Political Crime: The Formation of

Abstract = {``Sicherheit und grenzubergreifende politische Kriminalitat: Die
   Formierung transnationaler Sicherheitsregime in Europa im 18. und 19.
   Jahrhundert{''}. This contribution proposes to observe Foucault's
   concept of the security dispositive from the angle of transnational
   security and criminal law regimes. Since the late 18th century security
   and securitization became not only a prime category and field of
   national policies and discourses but were increasingly influenced by
   transnational issues and cross-border security threats (or narratives)
   such as international crime, transnational political violence and
   international conspiracies. This was accompanied by the formation of
   transnational security regimes, which concerned cross-border security
   policies, discourses and legal norms in the fields of extradition,
   political asylum, and police cooperation, with a variety of different
   actors: states, police organizations, experts, international
   organizations. These transnational security regimes and their respective
   fields were characterized by complex interdependencies and interactions
   as well as by legal pluralism, flexibility, fragmentation, collisions,
   and Entrecht/ichung, transgressing national security and extending
   securitization to indefinite ``global{''} security spaces. Though this
   could be interpreted as an ``international security dispositive{''} it
   as well challenges Foucault's concept which, in the end, should be
   substituted by the historical model of ``transnational security
   regimes{''}.},

   institutional forefront of the advanced societies, when four decades ago
   analysts of the penal scene were convinced it had entered into
   irremediable decline. Building on my book Punishing the Poor: The
   Neoliberal Government of Social Insecurity, I argue that (1) the
   expansion and glorification of the police, the courts, and the
   penitentiary are a response not to crime trends but to diffusing social
   insecurity; that (2) we need to reconnect social policies and penal
   policies and treat them as two modalities of poverty policy to grasp the
   new politics of urban marginality; and that (3) the simultaneous and
   converging deployment of restrictive ``workfare{''} and expansive
   ``prisonfare{''} partakes of the forging of the neoliberal state. After
   spotlighting key differences between the American and the European road
   to the penalization of poverty, I adapt Bourdieu's concept of
   ``bureaucratic field{''} to capture the symbolic import of punishment as
   a means of reality production and I stress the contingent nature of
   penal resurgence, against conspiracy theories and the functionalist
   vision shared by Marxist and Foucaultian analysts.},

Journal = {DICKENS STUDIES ANNUAL},

Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {223-251},
Abstract = {Readings of Dickens's historical novel, Barnaby Rudge (1840-41), have
   typically regarded its late-eighteenth-century plot, which includes an
   account of the Gordon Riots, as allegorizing the civil unrest of the
   1830s and early 1840s. Critics have thus tended to address the ambitious
   and unruly apprentice, Sim Tappertit, and his conspiracy of disaffected
   adolescents, in the contexts of Chartism, Trade Unionism, the revived
   Protestant Association of Dickens's own period, or the socio-economic
   conditions of Victorian London. But the name of Tappertit's secret
   society, ``the `Prentice Knights,{''} its ideology and symbolism, also
   gesture towards an alternative, historical framework: the seasonal
   festivities and chivalric fantasies associated with apprentice culture,
   from Mediaeval and Early Modern England to Dickens's own time. Linking
   Sim Tappertit both to George Barnwell, apprentice-protagonist of George
   Lillo's The London Merchant (1731), and back to the citizen drama of the
   Elizabethan and Jacobean stages, in plays such as Dekker's The
   Shoemaker's Holiday (1599) and Beaumont's The Knight of the Burning
   Pestle (1607), this article illuminates the actions and characterization
   of Sim Tappertit and his `Prentice Knights with reference to the social
   and literary history of apprentice misrule.},

Abstract = {In 2010, Kelly Greenhill published her highly acclaimed book Weapons of
   Mass Migration: Forced Displacement, Coercion, and Foreign Policy. In
   this article, I focus on the uses and implications of Greenhill's theory
   and specifically the metaphor Greenhill uses in place of ``coercive
   engineered migration{''}-{''}weapons of mass migration.{''} The metaphor
   unmistakably links refugees to ``weapons of mass destruction.{''} This
   should not be dismissed as just a phrase, considering that metaphors are
   one of the fundamental elements of thinking in international relations.
   Inquiring into the utility of the metaphor, I argue that associating
   refugees with weapons (1) weaponizes the metaphor against refugees, (2)
   frames the problem and possible solutions in a restrictive, securitized
   way that should be questioned, and (3) even undermines one of four
   policy options Greenhill her-self proposes. After highlighting the
   merits of Greenhill's analysis and its embrace among far-right
   ideologues and conspiracy theorists, using Paul Chilton and George
   Lakoff's delineation of three utilities of metaphors in foreign policy,
   I analyze the ``weapons of mass migration{''} metaphor. The article ends
   with a discussion of possible ways to mitigate the metaphor's effects
   and discusses alternative metaphors.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the financial collapse of Slovenia's Catholic
   Church, a scandal which resulted in the deposition of the country's
   archbishops, and its impact on religious belief and on the relations
   within the Slovenian Catholic establishment and community. Trust in the
   Church and religious participation have dropped markedly in Slovenia
   over recent years. While there are no significant changes in religious
   belief, other religious indicators continue to reflect an ongoing
   moderate trend towards secularisation that is characteristic of Slovenia
   in the post-socialist era. The public discourse of the Church's
   leadership and lay Catholics reveals tensions on the reasons behind the
   fall of the Church's financial empire and on the question of
   responsibility in the removal of Slovenia's archbishops. Two general
   types of reactions were identified in a content analysis of texts from a
   five-month period after the last depositions. Views within the Slovene
   Catholic Church, which uphold the institution's traditional stance, tend
   to explain these developments as part of a conspiracy against the
   Church. Others that are more open and reflective are critical towards
   the actions of the Church and demand change from within the institution.},

Abstract = {Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a revolutionary in two senses. Obviously, his
   role in the conspiracy to overthrow Hitler, when it was discovered,
   stamped him as a political revolutionary. Beyond that, however,
   Bonhoeffer was a theological revolutionary in that he repudiated and
   refuted the prevailing Lutheran-Hegelian-Rankean Geschichtsbild, i.e.,
   image of German history, that had become paradigmatic for his class, the
   so-called Bildungstnirgertum, the highly educated upper middle class.
   Central to this image was the idea of the Creator God as essentially a
   ``warrior{''} God who realized the history of salvation via the power
   struggles of nation states. Bonhoeffer, in his confrontation with the
   Third Reich, came to the conclusion that its evil triumph had a great
   deal to do with the image of history that underpinned it. This article
   traces the evolution of the doctrine of the Power State rooted as it was
   in Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms or realms, and shows how
   Bonhoeffer via his reflections expressed in the fragments known as
   Ethics, overturned that doctrine and thereby wrought an
   intellectual-historical achievement of immense significance not only for
   Germany, but also for the modem world.},

Abstract = {Extremist parties have become important political actors in the European
   Parliament and participate in national or regional coalitions. Spanish
   party Vox defends a combination of tradition, conservatism, nationalism,
   liberalism, and far-right values. Vox became the third force of the
   Spanish Parliament growing rapidly amid the harsh social measures taken
   by the Spanish Government. Without the editorial control of traditional
   media, far-right discourse is highly prominent on social media also for
   Vox. The objective of this research is to define the political strategy
   implemented by Vox on Twitter during the first lockdown in Spain. The
   research applies framing analysis in three phases: open coding and axial
   coding to subsamples and a final framing analysis on a sample of 6095
   tweets. Results show three main frames. Anti-elitism is defined as
   victimhood and anti-vox conspiracy. Essentialism is defined as moral,
   national essentialism, and public order. And finally, Criminal
   Government, the new frame accusing the government. This study suggests
   that Vox combines the populist, liberal and conservative discourses to
   deny the government's legitimacy and to turn into an alternative option,
   although their party dubiously is.},

Abstract = {The transnational anti-gender movement often has a strong connection to
   conservative religious organisations. However, even if the anti-gender
   movement is easy to recognise in Sweden, it is impossible for it to
   propagate significant opposition to gender mainstreaming and gender
   studies by using the Church as a reference due to white Swedish people's
   established and neo-colonial image of Sweden as exceptional, secular,
   modern, and a gender equal and tolerant nation. The aim of this article
   is to analyse how a transnational anti-gender discourse transforms and
   produces fear in a Swedish context. In focus is the editorial writer
   forSvenska Dagbladet, one of Sweden's most influential newspapers, Ivar
   Arpi and his critical articles and expressions in social media on gender
   studies and gender mainstreaming. The material shows that instead of
   connecting to religion in order to dismiss gender studies, gender
   studies is understood as the religion and conspiracy of our time,
   governing the state and its citizens. Drawing on Sara Ahmed, I argue
   that it is possible to follow how words and discourses act inaffective
   ways and how gender studies, gender ideology and gender mainstreaming
   become a single body that inspires fear.},

Title = {Comic Political Theology in Shakespeare's <i>Richard II</i> and the
   Glorious Revolution of 1688},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Recent critics who have challenged or revised Ernst Kantorowicz's
   seminal reading of Shakespeare's Richard II as ``the tragedy of the
   King's Two Bodies{''} share a common impulse to reject the tragic vision
   of political theology (inherited from Carl Schmitt) and imagine more
   affirmative, rational, and democratic alternatives. The first half of
   this essay returns to Richard II to uncover an overlooked model for a
   comedic political theology located not in King Richard's decline, but in
   Henry IV's ascension, particularly in the subplot of Aumerle's failed
   conspiracy. These scenes challenge Schmittian political theology in two
   ways. First, the moment of sovereign decision is temporally displaced;
   second, this displacement enables a political resolution through a
   distributed and participatory form of fiction-making, which enacts at a
   practical level, while it simultaneously obscures, the operations of
   constituent and constituted power. The second half of the essay tests
   the broader applicability of these concepts by examining the legal
   reasoning and narrative techniques of the 1689 English Bill of Rights, a
   text which reflects both displaced temporality and distributed
   participatory performance by assiduously avoiding any decisive location
   of political sovereignty-whether in the monarchs or the parliament.},

Title = {``Victims of feminism{''}: exploring networked misogyny and \#MeToo in
   the manosphere},
Journal = {FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1392-1408},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {The manosphere is a detached set of websites and social media groups
   united by the belief that men are oppressed victims of feminism. Even
   though the manosphere has existed since the early 2000s, its activities
   have been arguably influenced and increased by the perceived need for
   counterbalancing the growth of online feminist discourses, such as those
   conveyed by \#MeToo. By applying the theoretical lens of networked
   misogyny, this article explores the following research question: How is
   the \#MeToo debate framed and discussed in the manosphere? The question
   is addressed through a qualitative thematic analysis of 12 articles and
   641 comments about \#MeToo written on the websites Return of Kings and A
   Voice for Men, which are part of the groups Pick-Up Artists and Men's
   Right Movement, respectively. The analysis highlights some dominant
   themes: first, criticism and verbal abuse against women; second,
   dismissal of rape and description of \#MeToo as a feminist conspiracy;
   third, perceived victimization of men and a desire to reestablish
   patriarchal values. This suggests that the manosphere is not a
   homogeneous network but a cluster of misogynist networks characterized
   by different viewpoints and degrees of violence, and entangled with
   racist, homophobic, and far-right ideologies.},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurship, defined as executive deal making, involves four core
   activities: venture selecting, planning, executing, and assessing. These
   activities can be supported in a computerized gaming simulation to
   achieve cost-effective learning by doing, to study strategic processes,
   and to assess business education. Computerized gaming simulations give
   objective scores and can be comprehensive, flexible, and easy to
   administer. They should game pedagogically important processes and model
   pedagogically incidental ones. DEAL is a computerized business gaming
   simulation designed to test the concept of gaming all markets
   (resources, products money, and interpersonal relationships) in a
   multi-industry setting. Instructor configurable, network cognizant, and
   activity driven, it includes five instructor-configurable industries and
   seven participant-selectable roles. Being computer assisted, DEAL is
   generally very different from other computerized entrepreneurship gaming
   simulations, which are either computer based or computer controlled.
   DEAL incorporates all four core entrepreneurship activities and reveals
   the developmental stages of emerging organizations. DEAL resolves with
   computer assistance problems of participant antagonisms and
   conspiracies. A gaming simulation should be evaluated on the extent it
   games defining processes with administrative ease. Gaming simulations
   should have greater value in assessing entrepreneurship education than
   in facilitating it.},

Title = {Stories worth sharing - why do people spread news online?},
Journal = {ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 19},
Abstract = {Purpose-The insidious proliferation of online misinformation represents
   a significant societal problem. With a wealth of research dedicated to
   the topic, it is still unclear what determines fake news sharing. This
   paper comparatively examines fake and accurate news sharing in a novel
   experimental setting that manipulates news about
   terrorism.Design/methodology/approach-The authors follow an extended
   version of the uses-and-gratification framework for news sharing,
   complemented by variables commonly employed in fake news rebuttal
   studies.Findings-Logistic regression and classification trees revealed
   worry about the topic, media literacy, information-seeking and
   conservatism as significant predictors of willingness to share news
   online. No significant association was found for general analytical
   thinking, journalism skepticism, conspiracy ideation,
   uses-and-gratification motives or pass-time coping strategies.Practical
   implications-The current results broaden and expand the literature
   examining beliefs in and sharing of misinformation, highlighting the
   role of media literacy in protecting the public against the spread of
   fake news.Originality/value-This is, to the authors' knowledge, the
   first study to integrate a breadth of theoretically and empirically
   driven predictors of fake news sharing within a single experimental
   framework.},

Title = {Technological Transformation Processes and Resistance-On the Conflict
   Potential of 5G Using the Example of 5G Network Expansion in Germany},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The expansion of fifth-generation wireless technology (5G) has been
   assigned the significance of a `key technology' in connection with
   technological advances in the context of the digitalization of
   societies, which is a central goal of current governments in leading
   industrialized nations. As with other large-scale infrastructure
   projects such as the expansion of renewable energies as part of the
   energy transition in Germany, the plans for implementation are meeting
   with great resistance from the population, sometimes resulting in arson
   attacks on 5G transmission masts. Current research on 5G focuses
   primarily on technical-economic, health-related and, in the context of
   the COVID-19 pandemic, increasingly conspiracy-theoretical aspects,
   while questions of acceptance or conflict potential have received little
   attention to date. This article aims to address this research gap and,
   on the basis of a conflict-theoretical perspective according to
   Dahrendorf combined with a socio-economic contextualization in the sense
   of Bourdieu, approaches the question of the extent to which social
   conflict has already progressed and what regulatory possibilities
   socio-economic contexts assume in terms of significance. For this
   purpose, about 70 identifiable internet presences of citizens'
   initiatives against 5G were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated.},

Abstract = {In the present article we propose an analysis of the different senses
   that acquired the discourses on the Argentine-Chilean integration that
   circulated in the norpatagonian press, from the conformation of the
   ALALC until the end of the self-named ``Argentine Revolution{''}. To do
   this we resort to the most influential newspaper in a region whose
   territory was crossed by a multiplicity of processes that are linked
   early to Chile. In this sense we can mention the continuous movement of
   workers, goods and capital, from one side of the Andes mountain range,
   which has not only economic importance, but also shaped a substantial
   social and cultural contribution to the region. However, this close link
   has also awakened historical fears of territorial nationalism, which
   gave life to the most varied conspiracy theories. In summary, the
   tension between the deepening of ties across the Andes and the fears of
   the ``expansionist neighbor,{''} made up of the Patagonian space,
   together with the characteristics of a period marked by growing
   insecurity of society and the Argentine State, constitutes a scenario
   which was also conducive to the study of the polysemy deployed during
   those years by integrationist discourses.},

Abstract = {On June 1911, the journalist and employer in the Public Debt
   Administration, Zeki Bey, is assassinated. The trial, following this
   murder is largely covered by an ottoman newspaper, Mecheroutiette,
   published in Paris, in both French and Turkish. His chief director, the
   general Cherif Pacha, is one of the most prominent figures of the
   political opposition to the Young Turks' regime and leader of the
   Ottoman Radical Party. This criminal affair arouses lively debates among
   Ottoman citizens and divides the public opinion. On the one hand, there
   are claims of a premeditated crime planned by the party in power in
   order to eliminate any embarrassing voice. According to this version,
   the victim had at his disposal documents compromising the government's
   financial practices. On the other hand, the defense lawyers deny any
   conspiracy plot or political motivations behind this case. The analysis
   of this affair informs us about political situation in the early 20th
   century in the Ottoman Empire and reveals us the tensions undermining
   its social stability. In this study the Macedonian city of Serres in
   appears as a training ground for the fedais, or hired killers at the
   service of the Union and Progress Committee.},

Abstract = {QAnon, a group of conspiracy theorists dedicated to the overthrow of the
   deep state and the facilitation of the rapture, has been growing in
   strength and prominence since its inception in 2017. Originally started
   as an anonymous post on a message board, the collective has increased in
   membership, geographic footprint, and ideological reach. QAnon initiates
   have also expanded their repertoire of tactics, evolving from online
   chatter to rallies and, finally, to violent attacks, leading law
   enforcement to opine that the group may incite incidents of domestic
   terrorism. Although this outcome is possible, predictions of this kind
   have less merit unless supported by systematic analysis of the evidence.
   This essay attempts to address this need by providing an empirically
   grounded prediction of the future of QAnon. Specifically, it summarizes
   the results of comparative case analyses, which consists of examining
   groups and collectives that are comparable to QAnon on key factors and
   applying their trajectories to QAnon. Case comparisons indicate that
   QAnon may continue to grow in membership size and regional presence. In
   addition, QAnon members may persist in their use of violence, leading to
   an increase in the number and severity of their attacks.},

Title = {First principle study of inducing superconductivity in α-graphyne by
   hole-doping and biaxial tensile strain},

Abstract = {First-principle calculations within Eliashberg theory framework have
   been utilized to investigate theoretically the effect of hole-doping
   along with applying strain on superconductivity in alpha-graphyne and
   graphene as a benchmark. We show how the electronic properties,
   electron-phonon interaction strength and superconducting critical
   temperature T-c of alpha-graphyne and graphene are affected by
   hole-doping and biaxial tensile strain. Although, intrinsic
   alpha-graphyne is semi-metal but it is found that increasing hole doped
   concentration of 12.5-25\% changes its electronic properties from metal
   to semiconductor with a band gap energy of 0.46 eV. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that it is not possible to induce superconductivity in
   alpha-graphyne by the conspiracy of 12.5\% hole-doping and critical
   strain (8\%) contrary to 12.5\% hole-doped graphene under critical
   strain (12\%) which becomes superconductor with T-c similar to 12 K. It
   seems that the presence of C equivalent to C bond suppresses the effect
   of strain significantly and hole-doping slightly on improving
   electron-phonon coupling constant and T-c in contrast to graphene. (C)

Title = {Themes and Evolution of Misinformation During the Early Phases of the
   COVID-19 Outbreak in China-An Application of the Crisis and Emergency
   Risk Communication Model},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Social media has enabled misinformation to circulate with ease around
   the world during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
   This study applies the Crisis and Emergency Risk and Communication model
   (CERC) to understand the themes and evolution of misinformation on the
   Internet during the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, when
   the epidemic developed rapidly with mysteries. Drawing on 470
   misinformation rated as false by three leading Chinese fact-checking
   platforms between 1 January and 3 February 2020, the analysis
   demonstrated five major misinformation themes surrounding COVID-19:
   prevention and treatment, crisis situation updates, authority action and
   policy, disease information, and conspiracy. Further trend analyses
   found that misinformation emerged only after the nationwide recognition
   of the crisis, and appeared to evolve relating to crisis stages,
   government policies, and media reports. This study is the first to apply
   the CERC model to investigate the primary themes of misinformation and
   their evolution. It provides a standard typology for crisis-related
   misinformation and illuminates how misinformation of a particular topic
   emerges. This study has significant theoretical and practical
   implications for strategic misinformation management.},

Title = {Monetizing disinformation in the attention economy: The case of
   genetically modified organisms (GMOs)},
Journal = {EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-18},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The ubiquity of social media has created both opportunities and
   challenges for businesses and societies. For product brands, ideas, or
   campaigns to gain traction on social media platforms, they need to
   capture attention. This is often accomplished by creating and
   disseminating compelling information, even disinformation, on these
   platforms. Strategies that drive this attention economy are often not
   obvious. The monetization of disinformation is explored here through a
   case study on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the analysis of
   a dataset of 94,993 unique online articles. When combined these methods
   allow for the evaluation and exploration of various tactics that
   contribute to the evolving GMO narrative and their potential application
   to other topics. Preliminary results suggest that a small group of
   alternative health and pro-conspiracy sites received more total
   engagements on social media than sites commonly regarded as media
   outlets on the topic of GMOs. Other externalities observed include
   continued social and political controversy that surround the GMO topic
   as well as the growth of additional product and marketing approaches
   such as ``non-GMO{''} verification. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Title = {<i>La Republica de Venecia</i> ... (1617) and the <i>Castigo esemplare
   de' Calunniatori</i> (1618): a literary and political contest between
   Francisco de Quevedo and Giacomo Castellani?},
Journal = {PERINOLA-REVISTA DE INVESTIGACION QUEVEDIANA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {37+},
Abstract = {This report aims to show the proceeding by which the Hispano-Venetian
   political and literary debate, born as a consecuence of successful
   Boccalini's Pietra di paragone politico, reduces itself to a sharp
   personal controversy between Francisco de Quevedo and Giacomo Castellani
   with their ``avisos de Parnaso{''} titled La Republica de Venecia llega
   al Parnaso ... and the Castigo esemplare de' calunniatori respectively.
   After drawing the rippled cultural and political panorama that gave rise
   to the intense para-literature between pro-Savoyard and philo-Spanish
   where the two above-mentioned libels are inserted, this work attentively
   analyses the three texts written by Castellani as an answer to the
   anti-Venetian aviso ascribed to Quevedo: Annotationi, Allegatione and
   Castigo esemplare .... In this way it comes to underline, first of all,
   its declared anti-Spanish purpose and, secondly, its progressive
   transformation in a personal attack against Francisco de Quevedo.
   Finally it ends by proving the presence in Castellani's pamphlet, behind
   an effective satirical and parodical texture, of a real denunciation of
   Quevedo's involvement in the culminant event of the early seventeenth
   century Hispano-Venetian dispute: the conspiracy of Venice of 1618

Abstract = {The U.S. Department of Justice has prosecuted over 1600 criminal
   antitrust (price-fixing and related) cases since 1970. Yet we know
   precious little about the true genesis of these investigations. This
   paper uses the vector-autoregression methodology to examine the dynamic
   interrelationships between the various criminal and civil antitrust
   enforcement variables. A key result is that the number of criminal
   prosecutions increases in the years immediately following an increase in
   the number of civil cases, suggesting that merger reviews and other
   civil investigations may alert the antitrust authorities to criminal
   antitrust activities. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first
   econometric analysis that demonstrates the quantitative size of this
   effect and the time lags in the relationship. Other findings include
   important dynamic interrelationships between grand jury investigations,
   the number of individuals and corporations prosecuted, and criminal
   cases, indicating that information unearthed during a given criminal
   investigation and prosecution often reveals information about other
   conspiracies leading to future investigations and prosecutions. Finally,
   the number of criminal cases prosecuted increases following an economic
   downturn. We relate this increase to the literature, which points to
   cartel instability during economic downturns.},

Abstract = {How does social media facilitate deliberation and collective remembering
   of past revolutions amid protests in democratizing contexts? To explore
   this question, I performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of a
   unique archive of tweets posted during Moldova's Twitter Revolution in
   2009. The research revealed that Twitter enabled users living in Moldova
   and Romania to connect online, share information, and chat about the
   meanings of revolution, civil society activism, and resistance to state
   oppression, all while providing updates to Western media and warning the
   public about human rights abuses. Also, the research uncovered that the
   \#pman audiences from Moldova and Romania framed the protest
   differently. Whereas the Moldovans regarded it as a demonstration
   against election fraud, the Romanian twitterers framed the events as an
   anti-communist uprising analogous to the 1989 Revolution, which they
   mythologized to extract useful strategies for action communicated to the
   Moldovan activists. Moreover, twitterers from both countries engaged in
   a transborder conversation about unionism and national identity. Despite
   Twitter's documented positive impact on political engagement and Western
   media reporting, it simultaneously contributed to misinformation through
   the circulation of rumors, conspiracy theories, and calls for violence.},

Abstract = {Introduction. This study explores the COVID-19 information experiences
   of people at the outbreak of the pandemic in the United States.
   Methods. The research data from 1,979 participants was collected through
   an online qualitative survey.
   Analysis. A phenomenological approach was utilised to gain a deeper
   understanding of the COVID-19 information experiences. Cross tabulation
   was also used; however, the outcome is primarily qualitative.
   Results. Three types of information experiences were identified, i.e.,
   good, bad, and notable. The good information experiences indicated
   people's appreciation for factual information, state government or local
   news, and information about the collective well-being of people. The bad
   information experiences illustrated people's concerns about
   misinformation, fake news, and conspiracy theories, information coming
   from President Trump and his administration, health-related information,
   and information politics. The notable information experiences
   highlighted people's positive outlook on information and their concerns
   about information uncertainty, the politics of information, and
   coronaphobia.
   Conclusions. Findings suggest that information can significantly
   influence people's feelings, moods, emotions, and experiences in
   polarising ways, and highlights implications for managing people's
   well-being in times of mass misinformation and fake news.},

Title = {Mainstream media use for far-right mobilisation on the alt-tech online
   platform Gab},
Journal = {MEDIA CULTURE \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 15},
Abstract = {Far-right movements tend to have an ambivalent relationship with
   mainstream media. On the one hand, they often express animosity towards
   traditional media, accusing them of spreading `fake news' and being part
   of a hostile conspiracy against ordinary (white) people. On the other
   hand, this often antagonist perception of the media does not stop
   far-right actors from using mainstream reporting for their ideological
   online messaging. This contradictory relationship is situated in a
   broader societal context shaped by, among other factors, widespread
   mistrust towards the media, an increasingly polarised media landscape
   and the recent proliferation of a hyper-partisan online media ecosystem
   at the far-right fringes. Against this contextual backdrop, this
   multimethod study analyses over 45,000 posts from Australian users of
   the far-right alt-tech online platform Gab to examine the use of
   mainstream media sources for their ideological messaging. This is
   complemented by a qualitative in-depth analysis of 298 posts that share
   mainstream media content, identifying posting patterns of incorporating
   or reframing mainstream media outputs that seek to communicate far-right
   ideologies within the ideologically charged online community on Gab.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the formation of the image of the
   ``ecclesiastic-monarchist underground{''} and ``True Orthodox church{''}
   as reflected in the documents and photographs produced by the Soviet
   secret police during the late-1920s to the late-1950s. The concept of
   the ``True Orthodox church{''}, as an incrimination in criminal cases
   against religious believers, was developed on the pages of penal files,
   agent-operational files, secret reports and manuals of the secret
   police. It, however, oftentimes had little in common with the historical
   phenomenon of the catacomb True Orthodox church. The Soviet system
   framed popular religious traditions as political resistance and
   counterrevolutionary conspiracy in visual terms, a process in which the
   secret police too played an important role. The research integrates into
   the scholarship previously unknown archival documents, photographs,
   charts and photocollages pertaining to criminal cases against the
   alleged followers of the True Orthodox church. The analysis of this
   visual material discloses the internal mechanisms of knowledge
   production, when the secret police photograph served as a kind of
   ``ideological blueprint{''} and when it was subject to manipulation, the
   purpose of which was to expose the enemy and to prove the crime.},

Abstract = {The article examines local variations of the theonym Khyzyr-Ilyas in
   Tatar traditions, stable combinations with this name and also highlights
   parallels in other Turkic languages. In the corpus of material extracted
   from the field records of the author collected in the folklore and
   dialectological expeditions the dialect and ethno-cultural features of
   this theonym prevail. The purpose of this study is the reconstruction of
   the diversion nest with the vertex word Khyzyr-Ilyas in the texts of the
   Tatar conspiracies and spells. Motivational reconstruction of linguistic
   fact is depicted in a cultural context. In the article the patron spirit
   Khyzyr-Ilyas is ambivalent but if you violate the rules of communication
   with him it can punish a person. The author distinguishes two
   motivational lines: on the one hand, the theonym Khyzyr-Ilyas lives in
   the language as a precedent name, on the other hand, in the texts of
   culture theonym is described most closely to the local variants of the
   culture of the Tatars within their own ethnocultural space. It was also
   proved that depending on the motivation of a given theonym with its
   internal form this name becomes an appeal.},

Abstract = {Based on newly available archival documents and recent literature the
   article presents an analysis of the origins and development of the
   Bilderberg meetings of transatlantic elite in 1950s-1980s. Conspiracy
   theories notwithstanding it is demonstrated that the organization of
   these meetings was a joint transnational project of European and
   American elites in which private and government structures merged and
   private initiative was interwoven with group and bureaucratic interests.
   The promotion of this project became an important part of the formation
   of the Cold War Atlantic community. Also examined on case studies basis
   are specific functions performed by the Bilderberg meetings: elite
   fraternization and networking, consensus maintenance and reinforcement,
   elite recruitment and rejuvenation. The final conclusion is that despite
   many deep changes in international and transatlantic relations since its
   establishment Bilderberg retains its importance compared to other more
   specialized and homogeneous transatlantic networks because it serves as
   a hub network of confidential contacts between all key sectors and
   national segments of transatlantic elites. Activities of Bilderberg as
   well as of other informal transnational networks present a fertile field
   for interdisciplinary studies combining methods of history, political
   science and sociology.},

Abstract = {In mid-November 2011, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi tendered his
   formal resignation to President Giorgio Napolitano. It was a humiliating
   political exit' for the controversial Italian leader who had been the
   dominant figure in Italian politics since the mid-1990s. With Italy in
   the throes of an unprecedented financial crisis, Berlusconi's squabbling
   centre-right coalition had appeared increasingly incapable of dealing
   with the economic emergency engulfing the country. To restore
   credibility, Napolitano appointed Mario Monti who quickly put together
   an emergency government. Since then, the downfall of Italy's
   longest-serving post-war prime minister has generated a good deal of
   controversy. Allegations that Berlusconi was pushed out of power by a
   cabal of domestic and international detractors have been rife both
   inside and outside Italy. But how plausible are these claims? Was
   Berlusconi brought down by a conspiracy orchestrated by Napolitano and
   instigated by Italy's EU partners? This article will address these
   questions and, to do so, it will chart the dramatic events that led to
   his downfall and examine the international and domestic contexts in
   which these events took place.},

Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {229},
Number = {A},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a proliferation of online
   misinformation and disinformation about the virus. Combating this
   `infodemic' has been identified as one of the top priorities of the
   World Health Organization, because false and misleading information can
   lead to a range of negative consequences, including the spread of false
   remedies, conspiracy theories, and xenophobia. This paper aims to combat
   the COVID-19 infodemic on multiple fronts, including determining the
   credibility of information, identifying its potential harm to society,
   and the necessity of intervention by relevant organizations. We present
   a prompt-based cur-riculum learning method to achieve this goal. The
   proposed method could overcome the challenges of data sparsity and class
   imbalance issues. Using online social media texts as input, the proposed
   model can verify content from multiple perspectives by answering a
   series of questions concerning the text's reliability. Experi-ments
   revealed the effectiveness of prompt tuning and curriculum learning in
   assessing the reliability of COVID-19-related text. The proposed method
   outperforms typical text classification methods, including fastText and
   BERT. In addition, the proposed method is robust to the hyperparameter
   settings, making it more applicable with limited infrastructure
   resources.},

Abstract = {Indonesia has been facing a serious threat from fake news and hate
   speech which is wildly disseminated through social media. As the largest
   Muslim-majority country in the world, health issues and their link to
   religion are one of the most discussed topics on social media in this
   country. The aim of this study is to introduce a strategy to
   counterbalance fake news on vaccine issues. This research employed a
   mixed-method approach that used content of analysis data obtained from
   social media monitoring. In addition, semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with 15 participants from various sectors related to vaccine
   issues. Monitoring of six female Facebook users in anti-vaccine groups
   revealed that the top five topics discussed in Indonesia were halal
   certification, conspiracy, adverse effects, adjuvants, and vaccine
   substitution. This research recommends a communication strategy to
   counterbalance fake news on the vaccine, employing both medical
   professionals and trusted, influential members of the religious
   community to educate the public. They should have a strong background in
   medical issues and understand Islamic perspectives. The involvement of
   Ulama (Islamic religious leaders) is important and needed to explain
   that vaccines do not violate religious law.},

Journal = {NAUCHNYI DIALOG},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The article deals with the religious culture of the peasants of the
   Nizhny Novgorod province in the XVIII-XIX centuries. Particular
   attention is paid to the analysis of the materials of the investigations
   in cases of ``divination{''}. Definitions of the concepts ``magic
   deeds{''}, ``folk Orthodoxy{''}, ``folk religiosity{''} are given. The
   gender and age composition of those accused of divination is
   characterized. It is proved that both men and women were engaged in
   magical practices. Most of the defendants were over 34 years old. A
   classification of the ``magic{''} deeds of the Nizhny Novgorod province
   is proposed. The subject of litigation was healing practices (quackery),
   the use of conspiracies to resolve vital situations (search for loss, a
   fair decision, etc.), obtaining predictions (fortunetellers and
   hysterical women), the use of objects and special spells for one's own
   benefit, as well as found cases related to social behavior - flight,
   desertion, attempts to get rid of the owner or the coming punishment.
   The conclusion is made about the prevalence of ``magic{''} practices
   related to the health of a person or livestock. The author's
   reconstruction of the circumstances of life that led the accused to the
   investigation is presented.},

Title = {Medical Students and SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination: Attitude and Behaviors},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Since physicians play a key role in vaccination, the initial training of
   medical students (MS) should aim to help shape their attitude in this
   regard. The beginning of vaccination programs against severe acute
   respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an excellent time to
   assess the attitudes held by both medical and non-medical students
   regarding vaccination. A 51- to 53-item questionnaire including the
   Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale was administered to 1971 students
   (49.21\% male; 34.86\% MS); two career-related questions were also
   addressed to the MS. The majority of surveyed students indicated a
   desire to get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, with more medical than
   non-medical students planning to get vaccinated (91.99\% vs. 59.42\%).
   The most common concern about SARS-CoV-2 infection was the risk of
   passing on the disease to elderly relatives. While conspiracy theories
   regarding the COVID-19 vaccine are less popular among MS, both groups
   indicated concerns that vaccines may cause autism is equally common
   (similar to 5\%). Further studies exploring social attitudes towards the
   SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are a necessary first step to optimizing vaccination
   programs and achieving herd immunity.},

Abstract = {In theory, a fully functional quantum computer could break the
   cryptographic protocols that underwrite cybersecurity everywhere, which
   would be disastrous for national security, global trade, and civil
   society. Quantum cryptography, conversely, promises an unprecedented
   level of security, yet this benefit comes with some danger: revisionist
   actors with impenetrable communications might be able to conduct
   surprise attacks and covert conspiracies. In reality, neither of these
   threat scenarios are likely. Intelligence advantage in political
   competition depends on the interaction of technological infrastructure
   with organizational institutions. Robust cryptosystems can be undermined
   by poor organizational coordination, and careful security policy can
   compensate for technical vulnerabilities. Scientific innovation in
   quantum technology only affects one of these dimensions while
   potentially complicating the other. Even if the formidable engineering
   challenges of quantum computing can be overcome, signals intelligence
   collectors will still have to analyze a vast number of decrypts and
   deliver timely and relevant judgments to interested decision makers. The
   quantum networks of tomorrow, similarly, will provide little protection
   for complex organizations that have weak operations security practices.
   In the practice of intelligence, we should expect classical politics to
   dominate quantum computing.},

Abstract = {This article examines the debates around anarchist restriction that
   shaped the eventual passage of the Immigration Act of 1903 and argues
   that domestically oriented conceptions of national security are both
   challenged and constituted by transnational and international processes
   and currents. While discussions of transnational immigration control
   became important features of both scholarly discourse and popular debate
   in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 2001, these discussions were not
   new. Similar debates about immigration policy, security, and civil
   liberties shaped discussions between the mid-1880s and early 1900s, when
   an unprecedented wave of attacks against heads of state fed rumors of
   wide-ranging conspiracies, and reports of anarchist outrages in cities
   far and wide spread fear. Anarchist exclusion was far more than an
   example of a rising nativist tide raising all boats and excluding a
   widening spectrum of undesirable aliens. Such measures set the
   foundation for restriction based on political beliefs and associations
   that, over subsequent decades, would become critical to suppressing
   political dissent. Consequently, understanding how the fear of anarchist
   violence helped shape the contours of the domestic and diplomatic
   debates over anarchist restriction is critical as these old questions of
   transnational immigration control reemerge.},

Abstract = {Black men who have sex with men (MSM) contract HIV at disproportionately
   high rates, and National HIV/AIDS Strategy goals to reduce HIV incidence
   cannot be successful without improved HIV prevention among racial
   minority MSM. A total of 210 Black MSM from three cities (Cleveland,
   Miami, and Milwaukee) completed measures assessing their sexual behavior
   and demographic characteristics, as well as AIDS-specific psychosocial
   scales, broader contextual domains, and substance use. Nearly 50\% of
   men reported recent unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), often with
   non-main partners, with partners not known to be HIV seroconcordant, or
   with multiple partners. Thirty-seven percent of men reported being HIV
   positive. In multiple regression analyses, higher levels of unprotected
   behavior were predicted by weaker perceived peer norms for condom use,
   weaker risk reduction behavioral intentions, being HIV negative, and
   recent use of marijuana, cocaine/crack, and poppers. Greater number of
   UAI partners was associated with weaker perceived peer condom use norms,
   lower risk reduction intentions, illicit use of prescribed opiates, and
   fewer AIDS conspiracy beliefs. These findings suggest important factors
   that should be targeted in HIV prevention programs for Black MSM.},

   Essex and fictional construction of history},
Journal = {ETUDES EPISTEME},
Year = {2009},
Number = {16},
Abstract = {The 1601 conspiracy of the Earl of Essex could be seen as a minor
   historical event and yet, the Earl is one of the most important figures
   of the end of Elizabeth I's reign, both from a literary and historical
   viewpoint. He was often represented in literary works (before and after
   his death), and his role in English history was also determined by
   literary representations of his heroism and then of his political role.
   That is the reason why Essex is important to both literary critics and
   historians in their analysis of that period, because he is part of an
   English cultural history. In the sixteenth century, Essex's heroism
   first appeared in literary works that celebrated his military feats and
   / or were dedicated to him. Then, after 1601, he was given a more
   political dimension. For ideological writers such as Fulke Greville,
   George Chapman or Samuel Daniel, he became an political exemplum. As is
   obvious in numerous dramatic works that do not necessarily mention him,
   the Earl of Essex is emblematic of that period, in the sense that he
   represents an individual power threatening the power of the State.},

Abstract = {In 2007, Thailand enacted the National Health Act, which contains the
   Advance Directive (Section 12). Even though the Act was enacted nearly
   sixteen years ago, physicians have not fully adopted it, limiting the
   number of patients who can benefit from the Advance Directive. Thai
   culture values the role of extended family in end-of-life planning,
   which is frequently marked by a conspiracy of silence (inability to
   discuss end-of-life issues), so patients may have limited opportunities
   to participate in decisionmaking and care planning. Thailand introduced
   a Palliative Care Policy in 2014. The inclusion of palliative care in
   the health service plan is the most crucial factor for palliative care
   provision. Through health inspections, the Ministry of Public Health
   supervises, monitors, and evaluates the management of the National
   Palliative Care Program. Advance Care Planning (ACP) and three other
   major KPIs were to be included in health inspections by 2020. In 2021,
   the Office of the National Health Commission implemented ACP, including
   the formation of (a) a committee to create a national ACP form and
   standard operating procedures and (b) a steering committee to oversee
   the nationwide implementation of ACP.},

Abstract = {Anthroposophy is the spiritual and esoteric current conceived by the
   Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) after his experience in
   the Theosophical Society established by Helena Petrovna Blavatski
   (1831-1891). This paper focuses on the digital ethnography and the
   content analysis of a sample of independent anthroposophical social
   network production, analysing the 2021 Facebook posts of ten users
   selected on the basis of the cohesion and pre-eminence principle. Moving
   from these data and from the theoretical premises of independent Italian
   anthroposophy, I aim to discuss the epistemological status of its
   peculiar epidemiological counter-narrative, its socio-political
   implications and the role of conspiracy narratives within the
   contemporary spirituality frame. The specific feature emerging from the
   analysis is that of a narrative in which political power - mediumistic
   in its very nature - would be nothing more than an automaton acting for
   global economic elites, in their turn being tools in the hands of
   supernatural hindering entities. In this perspective, the social network
   production conveys a complex set of paradigmatic narratives in which the
   dynamics of re-sharing and amplification feed not only the internal
   semantic circuit, but also the offline social environment the actors
   belong to.},

Month = {AUG 26},
Abstract = {One June 15, 2021, infectious disease authorities from around the world
   participated in a joint webinar to share experiences and lessons learned
   in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the overriding goals of the
   conference ``COVID-19 Lessons Learned: A Global Perspective{''} was to
   provide documentation of worldwide COVID-19 response strategies, in
   order to combat the plethora of misinformation and conspiracy theories
   that are being actively disseminated. This misinformation is having a
   profound negative impact on controlling the pandemic in many countries.
   Misinformation which was addressed in the conference included
   challenging the seriousness of COVID-19 infections, a refusal to
   recognize aerosolization as the major mechanism of spread, a belief that
   schools can be opened safely without implementation of extensive control
   strategies, and that masks and vaccines are not effective. A second goal
   was the identification of common strategies between nations. Common
   strategies included the implementation of a range of closures, mask
   mandates, travel bans and the need for expanded testing. But of utmost
   importance there was recognition of the need to implement a coordinated
   national strategy, which is depoliticized and led by scientists.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {This study investigates patterns of lay perception of economics, and in
   particular the place of conspiratorial thinking regarding the economic
   domain. We devised four types of accounts in the economic domain, over a
   range of questions regarding different aspects of the economy: the
   classical neo-liberal economic view (which we labeled Econ101), and the
   Conspiracy view (the destructive outcomes of economy are due to small
   and powerful groups who are manipulating the markets), to which we added
   the Government malfunction view (failures in the economy are due to the
   authorities), and the Bad Invisible Hand view (the invisible hand may go
   wrong, and the equilibrium reached by its doings may be undesirable).
   The last two views are the ones most strongly endorsed by our
   respondents, in the US, Israel and Switzer-land. The pattern of
   inter-correlations between the four accounts, and that between each and
   the psycho-social variables we examined, exhibits two clusters, Econ101
   vs. the other three views of economy. This corresponds to a general
   opposition between people who trust the neoliberal economic system, and
   those opposed to it. What sets economic conspiratorial thinking apart
   are its links with other conspirational beliefs and with paranormal
   beliefs.},

Abstract = {Diffusion unhealthy elements like Israiliyyat, tradition has dominated
   Da(c)if and Maudu(c) empty spaces of Tafsir. The diffusions is not only
   the stories of previous nations. Even violate the sanctity of the
   glorious individuals such as the past Apostles and the Prophet's
   Companions who are protected and honoured by Allah in the Qur'an.
   Thaclabah bin Hatib al-Ansariy RA was one of the individuals that had
   been involved in this conspiracy. Charges of hypocrisy against a friend
   who used to accompany Rasulullah SAW and participate in the battle of
   Badr as Tha(c)labah should be evaluated scientifically and fairly. The
   readers, researchers and enthusiasts of Tafsir knowledge should not
   fully take and accept which were served by the scholars of tafsir in
   their scriptures. This is because the books of tafsir are not fully
   reliable reference to assess the validity of the Tradition of the
   Prophet. In this regard, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said: Three things
   without narration namely al-Tafsir, al-Maghaziy and al-Malahim (Ibn
   Taymiyyah 1426h/2005m. 13: 346). Thus, each narration that violates the
   principles and ethics of Quran and authentic Sunnah need to be assessed
   intellectually without ignoring the scientific reliance.},

Abstract = {A noted specialist on nationalism and identity issues in Russia and
   Central Asia reviews three of the main geographical metanarratives
   circulating in contemporary Russia. These are teleological master ideas
   that seek to explain Russia's essence and place in the world as a
   function of its territorial size and location. All of them argue that a
   specific element gives Russia its uniqueness among nations: Russia's
   territory is larger than other countries in the world and forms a
   specific continent (Eurasianism); Russia is going higher in the universe
   (Cosmism); and Russia is going farther north (Arctism). The author
   proceeds to discuss each metanarrative in turn before outlining their
   similarities in the concluding section of the paper. These similarities
   include the shared backgrounds of their leading proponents, their basis
   in public resentment over perceived slights and injustices of the past,
   and a conviction that Russia's size and location promise a brighter
   future. More broadly, she argues that each metanarrative combines
   conspiracy theories, occult experiences of modernity, and a willingness
   to transcend political realities. Journal of Economic Literature,

Abstract = {Systemic transition in post-communist Eastern Europe resulted in high
   inflation, rapid economic changes, and increased lack of control in
   everyday life. At the same time, anti-Semitic incidents were reported in
   this region after 1989. The ideological model of scapegoating (Glick
   2002; 2005) might serve as an explanation of anti-Semitic prejudice in
   post-transition Eastern Europe. The model predicts that the ideology
   defining Jews as powerful, cunning, and dangerous would gain popularity
   in times of crises and would lead to greater discrimination against
   Jews. In two nationwide representative sample studies of anti-Semitism,
   in Poland (N = 1098) and Ukraine (N = 1000), we applied the ideological
   model of scapegoating to study various forms of anti-Semitism
   (conspiracy-based belief in Jewish control and discriminatory intentions
   toward Jews). In both samples, economic deprivation led to increased
   discriminatory intentions toward Jews; however, only in the Polish
   sample was deprivation linked with higher beliefs in Jewish control
   (scapegoat-defining ideology). In Poland the rise of conspiracy beliefs
   about Jewish control partially explained the effect of deprivation on
   discriminatory intentions toward Jews. The implications of these results
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {Unlike the well known and often studied personal and literary
   relationship between Pushkin and Mickiewicz the Polish national poet's
   connection with Griboyedov does not belong to the items on the agenda of
   Slavic research. That may have to do with the fact that in spite of
   their personal knowledge, of their common friends (Bulgarin, Vyazemsky)
   and of their popularity in the contemporary literary life of Moscow and
   Petersburg both poets do not take notice of each other. The article
   departs from Stefan Chwin's statement that notwithstanding the lack of a
   genetic dependence the Polish romantic tale ``Konrad Wallenrod{''} and
   the Russian neoclassical comedy ``Wit from woe{''} both are
   typologically connected. Written in a revolutionary atmosphere, they
   show the psychosocial phenomena of ``public conspiracy{''} (a term
   borrowed from Mickiewicz's ``Parisian lectures{''}) from a different
   point-of-view. The following article shows the problems in relation with
   Mickiewicz's stay in Russia and discuss the presumable reasons of the
   mutual absence of interest and attention. The comparative analysis takes
   aim to deliver further analogies and differences between both works and
   the circumstances of their production and reception.},

Abstract = {This study explored the differences in COVID-19 vaccination readiness
   based on the 7C model and its association with vaccine acceptance among
   foreign-born immigrants, Japan-born immigrants, and locals in Japan. A
   cross-sectional survey was conducted in October 2021 (n = 3,690). Our
   results show that COVID-19 vaccination readiness, acceptance, and their
   relationship differ according to migratory status and nativity.
   Immigrant participants reported higher general vaccination readiness and
   acceptability for vaccination against COVID-19 than the Japanese
   participants, but had lower vaccination coverage, particularly among
   those born in Japan. The psychological determinants of Japan-born
   immigrants were more similar to those of Japanese participants than
   those of foreign-born immigrants. The effects of con-fidence,
   complacency, and constraints on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were strong
   among all three groups. However, the role of collective responsibility
   and conspiracy varied by migratory status. This study highlighted the
   importance of culturally tailored interventions in vaccine delivery to
   immigrants.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

   Tormay},
Journal = {HUNGARIAN CULTURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {15-41},
Abstract = {A Hungarian writer who became a prominent public figure in the Horthy
   era, Cecile Tormay's (1875-1937) fame and success was principally due to
   her memoir, Buidoso konyv {[}'The Hiding Book'], a work published in
   1920-21 that depicts the two Hungarian revolutions following World War
   I. This popular work enjoyed several editions during the interwar period
   and was translated into English and French for propaganda purposes.
   After World War II, Bujdoso konyv was among the first works banned by
   Hungarian authorities for its anti-Semitism. Hailed as the most notable
   female author of the interwar period, Tormay's name rose anew after the
   fall of socialism in 1989. Fueled by the official biography written two
   years after her death in the Horthy era by the conservative professor of
   literature, Janos Hankiss, a revival in the cult surrounding Tormay's
   work has taken place in recent years. Hankiss portrayed Tormay as a
   woman of Hungarian noble descent whose deeds were motivated by sheer
   patriotism. This paper contends that Cecile Tormay was embraced by the
   interwar elite for her active role in the counter-revolutionary
   conspiracy against the First Hungarian Republic.},

Volume = {16},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many anonymous conference key distribution protocols have been proposed
   in order to have conference participants make unbiased decisions without
   influence from unknown pressures. However, most of the previously
   proposed protocols do not provide forward secrecy, therefore if a
   conference chairman's private key is compromised, the conference keys
   distributed by the conference chairman in the past may be compromised,
   and adversaries can decrypt those ciphertext that have been transmitted
   over a public channel after encrypting with these compromised conference
   keys. This paper proposes a new anonymous conference key distribution
   protocol with the conference chairman's forward secrecy which means that
   the compromise of a conference chairman's private key cannot result in
   the compromise of conference keys distributed by the conference chairman
   in the past. A one way hash. function is used to protect each conference
   participant's common key shared with the conference chairman and to hide
   the identities of the conference participants. Under the Bilinear
   Diffle-Hellman (BDH) and One-way hash (OWH) cryptographic assumptions,
   the identities of conference participants are anonymous to each other,
   and even anonymous to the unattended ones. Furthermore, the proposed
   protocol is secure against impersonation and conspiracy attacks.},

Abstract = {A fictional account of the life and death of Sergei Kirov, Fridrikh
   Ermler's two-part film The Great Citizen (1937 and 1939) appears unusual
   due to its lack of action and its fetishization of the spoken word. As
   an instance of what Ermler called ``conversational cinema,{''} the film
   defines the outer limit of verbosity and immobility in socialist realist
   film. The movie's hero Shakhov mediates between Stalin and the Soviet
   masses; as a result, the conflict between Shakhov and the Trotskyist
   opposition represents a struggle between authentic and corrupt
   linguistic mediation in the film. By appropriating the myth of the
   Russian writer's martyrdom, The Great Citizen depicts Shakhov's demise,
   not merely as the result of a Trotskyist conspiracy, but more
   importantly as the necessary guarantor of the truth of Shakhov's words.
   Ermler's film reconfigures the writer's role in Russian society by
   inverting the hierarchy of the written and the spoken word, thus
   subjugating the myth of the martyred writer to the aesthetic and
   ideological goals of socialist realism. The Great Citizen demonstrates
   the importance of Kirov's martyrdom within Stalinist mythology and
   figures as a paradigmatic work of socialist realist film.},

Abstract = {The essay focuses on A. S. Pushkin's last fairy tale, which he wrote in
   1834, during the ``Boldin autumn{''} period. Researchers have offered
   diverse interpretations to this complex and enigmatic text that embraces
   Russian folk themes interlaced with both western European and eastern
   imagery. Suggested rationalizations of ``The Tale of the Golden
   Cockerel{''} have relied on Theodor Benfey's ``indianist theory{''} or
   on the local identity context, while other numerous diverse
   interpretations have pointed to conspiracy theories, the ideas of
   freemasonry, dystopianism, and the criticism of the absolutist rule.
   Still others saw this fairy tale as a covert autobiography, or a display
   of disguised eroticism in the spirit of the folk laughter culture, or as
   being influenced by the ideas of Islam, or as hinting at Russian mystic
   and ecstatic sectarianism. Having endeavored to examine the sources of
   ``The Tale of the Golden Cockerel{''}, the author approaches it based on
   the comparative-historical method with the help of literary
   anthropology. According to L. L. Selivanova, the great poet composed
   what would be accepted as a genuine Russian folk fairy tale by
   creatively reworking all the available western and eastern material,
   Russian lubok culture, and even literary hoaxes.},

Abstract = {We explored the contribution and effectiveness of state and non-state
   institutions in rural development efforts in highlands (Khyber
   Pakhtunkhwa {[}KPK] province) of Pakistan. This study employed
   mixed-methods research design and data were collected from 300 household
   heads, randomly selected from six villages from two purposively selected
   districts Mansehra and Nowshehra. Findings showed people in KPK were
   deprived of due to conflicts, conspiracies and terrorism, poor
   governance, small landholdings and subsistence farming followed by
   sluggish marketing system, insufficient education and training for
   people, and inadequate employment opportunities. Regarding contribution,
   non-state institutions had more contribution as compared to state
   institutions. T-test analysis showed that the non-state institutions had
   an effective provision of agricultural extension and forestry advisory
   services, education, health services in remote areas, skill development,
   and provision of microcredit schemes. The results of F-test statistics
   showed highly significant difference among the perceived effectiveness
   of rural development activities of different types of non-state actors
   (localite, cosmopolite, and religious/faith-based) working in the
   research area. This study recommends state-owned rural development
   departments revisit their working mechanism and develop synergistic
   working relationship with the non-state institutions in discharging
   rural development efforts.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to explain why the Roman dictatorship, which had
   served as a positive model of constitutional emergency government until
   the French Revolution, acquired a negative meaning during the Revolution
   itself. Both Montesquieu and Rousseau regarded the dictatorship as a
   legitimate institution, necessary to protect the republic in times of
   crisis. For the French revolutionaries, the word `dictatorship' acquired
   negative connotations: it became a rhetorical tool for accusing their
   political opponents of authoritarian rule. This article argues that Carl
   Schmitt's distinction between commissarial and sovereign dictatorship is
   unhelpful for understanding why the dictatorship was rejected by the
   French revolutionaries. Instead, it shows that it was the early
   identification with Montesquieu'saristocraticdictatorship, which caused
   the delegates of the National Assembly to reject it as a threat to
   popular sovereignty. The exception was Marat, who proposed to establish
   apopulardictatorship a la Rousseau to purge the state from
   counterrevolutionary forces. However, Marat's proposal found little
   support with his fellow-Jacobins, as it allowed the Girondins to accuse
   them of a conspiracy against the Convention. This caused the Jacobins to
   reject the dictatorship altogether and to propose alternative models of
   emergency government.},

Title = {Internal screening and dielectric engineering in magic-angle twisted
   bilayer graphene},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},

Abstract = {Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MA-tBLG) has appeared as a tunable
   testing ground to investigate the conspiracy of electronic interactions,
   band structure, and lattice degrees of freedom to yield exotic quantum
   many-body ground states in a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac material
   framework. While the impact of external parameters such as doping or
   magnetic field can be conveniently modified and analyzed, the
   all-surface nature of the quasi-2D electron gas combined with its
   intricate internal properties pose a challenging task to characterize
   the quintessential nature of the different insulating and
   superconducting states found in experiments. We analyze the interplay of
   internal screening and dielectric environment on the intrinsic
   electronic interaction profile of MA-tBLG. We find that interlayer
   coupling generically enhances the internal screening. The influence of
   the dielectric environment on the effective interaction strength depends
   decisively on the electronic state of MA-tBLG. Thus, we propose the
   experimental tailoring of the dielectric environment, e.g., by varying
   the capping layer composition and thickness, as a promising pursuit to
   provide further evidence for resolving the hidden nature of the quantum
   many-body states in MA-tBLG.},

Abstract = {In the years preceding Mexican independance, science and technology were
   privileged domains of the Enlightenment. But along side the enlightened
   institutional reforms in this field, the Inquisition exercised a strict
   surveillance on intellectuals. Coming from Guadeloupe after passing
   through several Spanish colonies, Esteban Morel, a French doctor living
   in New Spain, was the victim of the repression against French residents
   after the war between the Republic and Spain. An innovative mine owner,
   and the man who introduced inoculation into the viceroyalty (1779), he
   belonged to the enlightened circles of the colonial capital,
   contributing to the debats in the local press as well as to mining
   activities, the first source of wealth in the country. Influenced by the
   writings of Voltaire and Buffon, a deist and probably a free mason, he
   was exceptionally dangerous, for his influence extended to the very
   entourage of the Viceroy. Beyond this particular case, the dossier that
   the Inquisition mounted against Morel beginning in 1781 illustrates the
   subtle ways that the Enlightenment entered Mexico, and the resistance
   which it encountered no less than the violent repression in religious
   matters, that increased with the fear of a revolutionary conspiracy in
   1794.},

Journal = {PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING},
Year = {2023},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to explain the relationship
   among education, likelihood to vaccinate for COVID-19, and trust in
   healthcare providers among patients living with diabetes in the American
   South. Methods: Explanatory iterative sequential mixed methods design
   combined retrospective chart review, self-report surveys, and
   qualitative interviews.Results: Analysis of covariance revealed that
   severity of diabetes was not linked to vaccine acceptance. Overall,
   patients reported higher likelihood to vaccinate if their healthcare
   providers strongly recommend the vaccine. People with ``some college{''}
   education reported lowest likelihood to vaccinate, before and after
   their healthcare providers' strong recommendation. Integrated analysis
   revealed the complexity of patient-provider trust and vaccination
   decisions.Conclusions: In the context of COVID vaccination, particularly
   as conspiracy theories entered the mainstream, measures of trust in the
   system may be a clearer indicator of vaccine decision making than trust
   in personal physician.Practice implications: The nonlinear relationship
   between education and likelihood to vaccinate challenges providers to
   talk to patients about knowledge and understanding beyond a superficial,
   quantitative screening question about education. Health systems and
   public health officials need to find strategies to build trusting
   relationships for patients across systems, such as community health
   workers.},

Title = {FRESH FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION WITH COMPETITION AND DIFFERENTIATED
   FRESHNESS PRESERVATION METHODS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY},
Abstract = {For a secondary supply chain consisting of a supplier and two competing
   retailers, freshness spoilage rate, competitive behavior and market
   capacity constraint are introduced into the traditional
   demand-substitution model. Under different preservation methods such as
   chilling and freezing, the Gounod double oligopoly game and the
   conspiracy game competition mod-els between retailers are constructed
   with the benchmark of the centralized decision-making. The optimal sales
   price and ordering decision are secured, and the influence of market
   volume, freshness deterioration rate and demand substitution rate on the
   optimal decision is analyzed under different compe-tition models.
   Meanwhile, an optimal revenue coordination contract is con-structed to
   maximize the benefits of each subject in the fresh supply chain. The
   results show that the optimal sales price and optimal order quantity are
   positively correlated with the respective market volume and demand
   substitu-tion rate, but negatively correlated with the deterioration
   rate of goods. The optimal coordination degree of the proposed
   revenue-sharing contract is 100\%, which indicates that this contract
   can effectively coordinate the interests of all parties in the fresh
   supply chain and achieve the overall optimal supply chain.},

Abstract = {Media coverage of protests following the murder of George Floyd on May
   26, 2020, tended to ascribe to the demonstrations two faces: One,
   presented by organizers and supporters, was a decentralized movement for
   peaceful change; the other was a violent conspiracy for the disruption
   of order. Good analysis has flowed into the question of domestic media
   bias in the coverage of Summer 2020's historical events. Less attention,
   however, has been directed to the ways foreign media covered the
   protests. One of the most powerful voices in framing the story of the
   protests to a global audience was Russia's statesponsored media behemoth
   RT. And nowhere was RT's particular take on the demonstrations more
   pronounced than its Arabic-language broadcast RT Arabic or RT3. Through
   the lens of discourse analysis, I focus on a small sample of
   quintessential reports to explore how RT3 covered Summer 2020's
   momentous events, what their reporting tells us about Kremlin
   disinformation strategies, and how RT3's coverage of the protests
   factors into the Kremlin's greater geopolitical agenda vis-a-vis the
   Middle East and North Africa.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Social crisis situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic provide a fertile
   ground for radical actors and social movements to strengthen their
   radical mobilization-mainly using social media. In light of the
   deplatforming efforts of social media platforms that forced radical
   actors to establish new channels to continue their discourses and the
   recent crisis that opened a discursive opportunity structure, we
   investigate how radical actors use Telegram for mobilization. Based on a
   longitudinal manual content analysis of 13,371 messages from 188 German
   Telegram channels of the Querdenken movement, conspiracy, and far-right
   actors, we examine mobilization strategies (namely direct appeals and
   populist blame game) and their success (retransmission) between March
   2020 and December 2021. We found that both offline and online appeals
   and the use of anti-elitism increased significantly over time. The use
   of direct and indirect mobilization attempts is related to the
   ideological background of the actors, with direct appeals being favored
   by the Querdenken movement. Furthermore, the results shed light on the
   mechanisms of radical mobilization on Telegram, showing that both direct
   appeals and the populist blame game are successful strategies for
   radical actors because they increase message retransmission.},

Abstract = {Freemasonic activity in the Ottoman lands saw an unprecedented growth
   and dynamism in the final phase of Ottoman history particularly
   benefitting from its close association with the Young Turk movement and
   its political apparatus, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP).
   Ottoman freemasonry was led to a new level of popularity with a great
   deal of public visibility, a consequence of which was the formation of
   the Ottoman Grand Orient as a national organization for the first time
   in the Ottoman lands. Despite the ensuing controversial accusations and
   conspiracy theories against the freemasonic institution which became
   commonplace during the period in question, it occupied a place within
   the Ottoman state and society which it had never attained before. This
   made it possible for the Ottoman freemasons to integrate themselves to
   the universal fraternal discourse of the freemasonic philosophy during a
   last attempt of the Ottoman administration to keep its remaining lands
   intact. The intention of this article is to create a window within the
   broader picture of the socio-political environment of the time with a
   view to the position and involvement of freemasonry in which its
   association with the CUP often stands out as a major factor.},

Abstract = {This article is about the experiences of three Chinese men who were
   involved in smuggling between India and China during the Second World
   War. Chen Mengzhao's rise as a leading figure in India-China smuggling
   in Calcutta uncovers the hidden links between the black markets in India
   and China during the Second World War. Gao Wenjie disguised himself as a
   Chinese army officer and utilized this fake identity to facilitate his
   smuggling business. Wang Li-an was sent to Calcutta to undertake
   smuggling for a Chinese government department. In telling these stories,
   this article argues that most smuggling in modern India and China was
   undertaken in transnational contexts that resulted in transnational
   effects. Ironically, the Nationalist government's state-building project
   to contain India-China smuggling ended by facilitating it. This project
   was further perceived by the British authorities as a Chinese conspiracy
   against India's sovereignty. The misunderstanding between the Chinese
   and British authorities led to the end of Chinese immigration to India
   in 1945. Overall, this article provides a new perspective to make sense
   of the tensions between the Chinese, Indian, and British governments
   during the Second World War.},

Abstract = {Police-suspect interactions (PSIs) are a site for negotiating power. In
   the Nigerian context, scholarly investigations from the pragmatic and
   discourse analytical ambits have probed how investigating police
   officers (IPOs) enact and sustain power in PSIs. However, the place of
   the suspect in Nigerian policing has not enjoyed sufficient scholarly
   investigation. This study investigates how suspects deploy discursive
   devices to resist IPOs' powers, with a view to describing the
   implication of such resistance for the language of interrogation in
   Ibadan, Nigeria. Fairclough's perspective on power relations serves as
   the theoretical anchor for the study. Twenty interrogation sessions were
   audio recorded at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence
   Department (SCIID), Ibadan, Oyo State. Of these, eight interrogation
   sessions, two cases each of kidnapping, affray, conspiracy and
   defamation of character were selected for analysis. The analysis of
   selected data reveals that suspects are not usually at the mercy of IPOs
   during PSIs; they resist police powers by deploying topic control to
   construct avoidance, positive self, denial through alternatives,
   concealment and interrogatives to challenge IPOs so as to avoid
   incrimination. The study recommends further suspect-related studies to
   further establish the place of the suspect in PSIs.},

Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {An intellectually charitable understanding of populism might begin by
   recognizing that, since populist citizens tend to be politically
   uninformed and lacking in higher education, populist ideas are likely to
   be inarticulate reproductions of the tacit assumptions undergirding
   non-populist or ``mainstream{''} culture rather than stemming from
   explicit theoretical constructs, such as an apotheosis of the unity or
   the will of ``the people.{''} What features of our ambient culture,
   then, could explain the simplistic and combative approach that populists
   seem to take to politics and policy, their impatience with political
   debate and deliberation, their willingness to set aside democratic legal
   forms and political norms, their nationalism, their personalization of
   politics, their inclination toward conspiracy theorizing, their fondness
   for fringe sources of information, and their suspicion of political,
   scientific, and media elites? Using focus group and survey data, we can
   understand these populist traits as reflections of the culture of
   ``democratic technocracy{''}: a regime in which we, the people, are
   assumed capable of rendering sound judgments about how to solve our
   social and economic problems. Whether or not this assumption is
   warranted, its cultural dominance seems likely to generate the ideas
   that populist citizens apparently take for granted.},

Abstract = {This themed issue poses questions concerning financial cuts and their
   impact on contemporary society and the arts. It presents a collection of
   perspectives, in particular from Greece, in order to examine artistic
   and aesthetic practices. It explores how society is being transformed
   into a post-democracy and how citizens are becoming post-citizens. These
   transformations will have implications in the redefinition of both
   post-democracy and post-citizenship as two oppositional forces, which
   may no longer be reconcilable and could lead to insurrectional and
   repressive politics. The role that art plays and will play in shaping
   these discourses by presenting alternative imaginaries to the narratives
   of the body politic will have to be evaluated in a context of aesthetic
   concurrence and conspiracy of art. But if the artists are transformed
   into post-citizens - it may be safe to assume that as post-artists their
   contributions will be more free - or totally freed - from the restraints
   and bonds of national and supranational institutions, leading de facto
   to the production of counter narratives and imaginaries that will be
   perceived by the post-democracies' body politic as insurrectional art.},

Abstract = {Since the alleged conspiracy by the U.S. and U.K. governments to invade
   Iraq in 2003, the national security state in both countries has been
   subjected to intense scrutiny by news organizations around the world.
   This scrutiny has been fueled in part by what some describe as the
   development of a networked fourth estate (Benkler 2011) involving ad hoc
   alliances between professional journalists, citizen journalists,
   hackers, and leakers. On the surface, this attention challenges radical
   conceptions of a power elite remaining in the shadows and impervious to
   accountability exercised through the media. Amid cultural chaos (McNair
   2005) and seemingly ubiquitous displays of adversarial journalism
   without fear or favor, how far are powerful interests still able to
   control the agenda and manipulate outcomes? The article presents
   findings in relation to a single case study involving critical coverage
   of the national security state and a particular aspect of containment
   that emerged. It concerns how the controversies were resolved through an
   apparent spectacle of accountability that suggested a resolution
   eschewing the need for further scrutiny or sanction. The paper further
   contends that this element of story closure warrants renewed attention
   in the study of news framing and ideological power.},

Abstract = {F.M. Scherer has not effectively rebutted my subjectivist criticism of
   the standard microeconomic welfare model; Scherer's historical reference
   to what Congress (allegedly) believed is irrelevant to the theoretical
   concerns raised by subjectivism. Nor does my `'principal'' criticism of
   antitrust policy rests on `'philosophical foundations''; my principal
   criticism rests on conventional economic analysis and a detailed
   economic history of the classic antitrust cases. My conclusion that the
   electrical equipment conspiracy of the late 1950s had no significant
   effect on market prices is supported by Ralph Sultan's findings; indeed,
   it is Scherer who brutally ignores the context and misrepresents the
   general thrust of Sultan's research. Scherer's comments on OPEC confuse
   the distinction that I made between private and governmental cartels.
   Finally, the economic welfare model that Scherer embraces so
   enthusiastically at the start of his review cannot be so suddenly
   discarded when I show something inconvenient: namely, that the
   `'dominant firms'' in the classic antitrust cases did not reduce market
   output and did not raise market prices. Scherer has not come to grips
   with my central thesis that antitrust regulation has generally been
   employed to restrain the competitive market process.},

Abstract = {This article offers an analysis of three plays about Napoleon Bonaparte
   performed at the Cirque national theatre at the end of the Second
   Republic and in the early years of France's Second Empire: Bonaparte en
   Egypte by Fabrice Labrousse and Narcisse Fournier, Le Consulat et
   l'Empire by Labrousse and Albert, and La Barrie're de Clichy by Paul
   Meurice, Alexandre Dumas pe're, and Auguste Maquet. Intended for a
   mainstream audience, these mimodrames allowed Louis-Napole ` on
   Bonaparte's government to manipulate historical narratives about his
   famous uncle in order to strengthen his own power. Although based on
   historical facts, these plays about Napoleon were nonetheless subject to
   pre-performance censorship, as were all dramatic works at that time. My
   analysis highlights how the changes required by the censors altered the
   historical narrative in these plays, erasing Bonaparte's revolutionary
   origins, and minimizing any suggestion of a conspiracy against him or
   opposition to his coup d'etat. These plays created a founding myth of
   the French nation, based on a story of progress and continuity, that
   effectively silenced any suggestion of revolution or regime change.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC HISTORY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this article, we highlight the exciting and growing historical
   podcast scene in Canada. We chose a variety of podcasts to represent the
   diverse institutions, communities and individuals who are telling
   histories through this medium. To represent popular history, we looked
   at Our Fake History a project that delves into historic mythologies and
   conspiracies. For the academic perspective, we looked at Active History,
   produced by Sean Graham of Carleton University, and at the museum-based
   podcast, Kitchen Stories, from the Jewish Archives of British Columbia,
   as an example of institutionally produced media. Community podcast The
   Nameless Collective and student-run podcast 3600 secondes d'histoire
   round out our survey. Each podcast shows a different approach to telling
   history, and allowed us to explore the issue of authority. Asking the
   question, ``Can we trust historical podcasts?{''}, we examine how each
   podcasters establish their relationship to their audience, and conveys
   their expertise on the topics they discuss. Regardless of the perceived
   level of formal authority, from individual to institution supported
   podcaster, we found that trust was formed primarily through the intimate
   listening experience. Listeners are invested in keeping the podcasters
   accountable and therefore help produce trustworthy historical podcasts.},

Abstract = {Misinformation under the form of rumor, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories
   spreads on social media at alarming rates. One hypothesis is that, since
   social media are shaped by homophily, belief in misinformation may be
   more likely to thrive on those social circles that are segregated from
   the rest of the network. One possible antidote to misinformation is fact
   checking which, however, does not always stop rumors from spreading
   further, owing to selective exposure and our limited attention. What are
   the conditions under which factual verification are effective at
   containing the spreading of misinformation? Here we take into account
   the combination of selective exposure due to network segregation,
   forgetting (i.e., finite memory), and fact-checking. We consider a
   compartmental model of two interacting epidemic processes over a network
   that is segregated between gullible and skeptic users. Extensive
   simulation and mean-field analysis show that a more segregated network
   facilitates the spread of a hoax only at low forgetting rates, but has
   no effect when agents forget at faster rates. This finding may inform
   the development of mitigation techniques and raise awareness on the
   risks of uncontrolled misinformation online.},

Abstract = {After having been dormant for much of the 20th century, the concept of
   cosmopolitanism has regained some of its former rhetorical power in
   current academic and political debates. Taking Kwame Anthony Appiah and
   Robert Fine as key interlocutors, the article argues that a historically
   informed analysis of the linguistic context, in which the language of
   cosmopolitanism first emerged, can help us understand better the
   political and ideological underpinnings of the concept. In the first
   part of the article, I discuss the emergence of cosmopolitanism in the
   context of what I shall refer to as the `ismatization' of political
   language in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In the second part,
   I turn to what I consider to be a key text for understanding the
   paradoxes of cosmopolitanism: the essay Das Geheimnis des
   Kosmopolitenordens ('The Secret of the Order of the Cosmopolitans'),
   published by the German novelist, poet and publicist Christoph Martin
   Wieland in the journal Teutscher Merkur in 1788. At the end of the 18th
   century, I argue, Wieland makes a similar observation to Fine, namely
   that the `ism' connotes something doctrinal, even sectarian, and steeped
   in secrecy and conspiracy.},

Abstract = {During the special action of land reclamation (land control act) in city
   Z of province A, some Christian churches were identified as ``illegal
   constructions{''}. Based on the field research materials gathering from
   these ``illegal{''} churches in city Z, this article applies ``belief
   pattern (Xinyang Fangshi){''} as the core concept to analyze motivations
   and operations in the establishment of local Christian churches, and
   discusses the interactions between local government and Christians in
   this process from the perspective of ``land rules{''}. It can be
   inferred that the ``Church{''}, as an important element in the local
   belief pattern, which was objectified during construction and finally
   led to the ``Church Building Fever{''}, is the antecedent cause of these
   illegalized churches. Through the comparative study of four typical
   ``illegal church{''} cases, this article demonstrates that the religious
   land use has adopted informal institutions and resulted in the
   suspension of formal system and involution of local government, along
   with the ``conspiracy{''} or ``co-opetition{''} between government and
   Christian churches for shared interests, all fostering the springing -up
   of ``illegal churches{''} in varying degrees. In summary, a series of
   problems regarding ``illegal churches{''} indicates the lack of public
   order in a local society.},

Abstract = {Since September 11, 2001, the U.S. government as well as police
   departments across the United States, most notably the New York City
   Police Department (NYPD), have been collecting intelligence targeting
   Muslim American communities. The controversial surveillance practices
   include the use of confidential informants, undercover operations, and
   entrapment, and infringing upon civil rights and civil liberties in the
   name of national security. A decade before 9/11, however, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted the same practices against a
   completely different demographic-Christian Right militants, through a
   program called PATCON, short for Patriot Conspiracy. Building upon the
   concept of surveillance as social sorting (Lyon 2013) and surveillance
   and terrorism (Monahan 2012), this article will compare the histories of
   surveillance practices as undertaken by the FBI on American Christian
   Right militants with the tactics used by the NYPD on non-militant Muslim
   Americans. This article will also assess the implications of these
   programs in the context of civil rights, arguing that the legacy of
   mistrust between the respective targeted groups and the federal
   government and agencies implementing the surveillance programs has
   undermined the national security interests of the United States.},

Abstract = {In 1984, Shamir {[}1] introduced the concept of an identity-based
   cryptosystem. In this system, each user needs to visit a public key
   generation (PKG) and identify himself before joining a communication
   network. Once a user is accepted, the PKG will provide him with a secret
   key. In this way, if a user wants to communicate with others, he only
   needs to know the ``identity{''} of his communication partner and the
   public key of the PKG. There is no public file required in this system.
   However, Shamir did not succeed in constructing an identity based
   cryptosystem, but only in constructing an identity-based signature
   scheme. Meshram and Meshram {[}5] have proposed an identity-based beta
   cryptosystem, security under the generalized discrete logarithm problem
   with distinct discrete exponents in the multiplicative group of finite
   fields and integer factorization problem.
   In this paper, we propose some modification in identity-based beta
   cryptosystem based on generalized discrete logarithm problem with
   distinct discrete exponents in the multiplicative group of finite fields
   and integer factorization problem and we consider the security against a
   conspiracy of some entities in the proposed system and show the
   possibility of establishing a more secure system.},

Title = {Reflexive modernization and reconstructing the Third Way: a response to
   Mouzelis},

Abstract = {Nicos Mouzelis has made a welcome intervention into the debate over
   Third Way theory and politics. The strengths of Mouzelis' account are
   identified as being his incorporation of asymmetrical power relations
   and institutional imbalances into the theory of reflexive modernization,
   and his defence of the Left/Right dichotomy. Three interrelated
   criticisms are then made. The first is of a sociological reductionism
   which neglects the importance of ideology and politics in bringing about
   the processes of reflexive modernization underpinning the Third Way.
   Conversely, the second criticism is that Mouzelis drifts into
   voluntarism in the form of a conspiracy theory in his account of
   `cultural engineering from the top' amidst the conditions of reflexive
   modernity. Further, it is suggested that it is not with regard to
   achieving' cultural rights' against such top-down engineering that the
   Left/Right distinction endures, but rather in relation to how the role
   of the market is analyzed. Thirdly, at the level of institutional
   differentiation and power relations, Mouzelis underestimates the extent
   to which market logic is able to `colonize' other spheres of social
   life, and his regulatory proposals are insufficient to address this.},

Title = {The Interpretive Interface: Where Journalistic and Pluralistic
   Discourses (Don't) Meet},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 27},
Abstract = {This article identifies the interpretive journalistic styles and forms
   used by four Flemish digital news startups and presents a theoretical
   and empirical exploration of their potential implications on media
   pluralism. Considering the various manifestations of interpretive
   journalism (i.e., from analytical-advisory to overtly advocacy), this
   study was designed to (i) operationalize the different degrees in which
   journalists openly intervene in, and reflect upon, the construction of
   their news stories, and (ii) investigate the dynamic between the former
   and the pluralistic character of news discourse. Theoretically, this
   article draws from (i) journalism as a performative discourse and (ii)
   the concept of agonistic pluralism. Methodologically, it offers an
   empirical framework guided by three analytical focal points:
   journalistic voice, scrutiny and reflexivity. Our study identified three
   interpretive interplays: (i) a detached form of subjectivity, (ii) the
   concurrence of personal-storytelling practices and a conversational
   register and (iii) the thin line between advocacy, dogmatism and
   conspiracy. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these
   interpretive interplays on media pluralism with a specific focus on
   reflexivity as a key enabler for broad and engaging meaning-making
   processes.},

Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {98-108},
Abstract = {Publics have traditionally been conceived as sites of social
   integration. While discord, controversy, and contestation may be
   acknowledged, theorising publics and especially public spheres are
   characteristically geared toward the production of consensus and/or the
   conditions of the possibility of unified decision-making. On this view,
   publics beyond the nation-state are reduced to conceptual extensions of
   the nation-state-The move to a higher level of aggregation, imagined as
   global or international, seems to make no conceptual difference. Against
   this, I propose to conceptualize publics as sites of the constitution of
   social struggles. To this end, I introduce Nancy Fraser's concept of
   ``subaltern counterpublics,{''} previously applied exclusively to
   national contexts, to the study of global politics. With a view to
   future empirical application, I discuss three promising sites for the
   further study of subaltern counterpublics in global politics: colonial
   public spheres, transnational social activism, and the circulation of
   extreme right-wing conspiracy tropes. Taken together, I conclude, these
   three sites of inquiry provide an important corrective to a statist
   concept of the public in which the place, purpose, and direction of
   publics are always already taken for granted.},

Abstract = {Since the first cases of SARS CoV-2 emerged, the virus has spread in
   waves all over the world. As an involuntary by-product a flood of
   different stories went viral. This article does not intend to provide an
   overview of this elusive material of rumors, conspiracy theories, jokes
   and so on. Rather it tries to demonstrate the potential of narrative
   research, seeing itself as critical social analysis, in dealing with the
   pandemic. To this end, the social framework of the pandemic and the
   discourses linked to them will first be examined. From there I will
   investigate different narrative complexes growing out of these framework
   conditions and discourses. Three of them will be examined in closer
   detail: Stories can firstly be read as an expression of collective
   prejudices or as an outlet for diffuse fears; secondly, they can be a
   symbolic expression of tendencies towards cleavage within a society or,
   thirdly, they can be powerful instruments at the highest level of
   international politics. All three levels ultimately interact or meet in
   everyday storytelling. We are dealing here with a complex, mutual
   relationship between a virus, the stories circulating about it and the
   society confronted with both.},

Title = {A Blockchain-Based Secure Multi-Party Computation Scheme with Multi-Key
   Fully Homomorphic Proxy Re-Encryption},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {At present, secure multi-party computing is an effective solution for
   organizations and institutions that want to derive greater value and
   benefit from the collaborative computing of their data. Most current
   secure multi-party computing solutions use encryption schemes that are
   not resistant to quantum attacks, which is a security risk in today's
   quickly growing quantum computing, and, when obtaining results, the
   result querier needs to collect the private keys of multiple data owners
   to jointly decrypt them, or there needs to be an interaction between the
   data owner and the querier during the decryption process. Based on the
   NTRU cryptosystem, which is resistant to quantum computing attacks and
   has a simple and easy-to-implement structure, and combined with
   multi-key fully homomorphic encryption (MKFHE) and proxy re-encryption,
   this paper proposes a secure multi-party computing scheme based on
   NTRU-type multi-key fully homomorphic proxy re-encryption in the
   blockchain environment, using the blockchain as trusted storage and a
   trusted execution environment to provide data security for multi-party
   computing. The scheme meets the requirements of being verifiable,
   conspiracy-proof, individually decryptable by the querier, and resistant
   to quantum attacks.},

   rationality factor that is mostly explained by numeracy and actively
   open-minded thinking},
Journal = {INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {90},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {We conducted two studies with two goals in mind. First, we investigated
   the dimensionality of several prominent cognitive bias tasks to see
   whether a single rationality factor can explain a performance on these
   tasks. Second, we validated this factor by correlating it with a number
   of constructs from its nomological network (fluid intelligence,
   numeracy, actively open-minded thinking, conspiracy and superstitious
   thinking, personality traits) and several real-life outcomes
   (decision-outcome inventory, job and career satisfaction, peer-rated
   decisionmaking quality). Although in both studies one-factor solution
   was the most appropriate for our tasks, this factor (i.e., ``rationality
   factor{''}) was weak and only able to account for modest portion of
   variance among the tasks. Across both studies, the two strongest
   correlates of this rationality factor were numeracy and actively
   openminded thinking. We conclude that cognitive bias tasks are highly
   heterogeneous, having very little in common. What they had in common,
   however, was largely underpinned by abilities and dispositions assessed
   with numeracy and actively open-minded thinking. We discuss how our
   findings relate to the dual-process theories and offer our view on the
   place of rationality in a broader model of human intelligence.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into focus a shift in the
   communication of health-related information. Traditionally, public
   service announcements (PSAs) consisted of video or radio messages,
   posters, or billboards created by government agencies and health
   organizations to provide information about health topics. However, the
   widespread use of the internet and the growth of social media has
   changed PSA creation and dissemination in many ways. Increasingly, a
   variety of actors, including non-official sources and lay persons, have
   been using social media to disseminate PSAs or PSA-like content.
   Audiences are larger and more engaged with content, and users have the
   novel ability to interact with PSAs through shares, likes, or comments.
   While social media for health communication has many advantages, there
   are also a number of disadvantages including misinformation, conspiracy
   theories, bots, and trolls. Credibility of different sources has also
   become a topic of debate. An ongoing challenge during the pandemic has
   been reaching audiences in a crowded online environment, establishing
   authority as a trusted source, and countering misinformation. In this
   paper, we discuss how the media landscape is changing PSAs and the
   implications of these changes in the context of pandemics.},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {English playwrights were fascinated by Italy both in a positive and a
   negative way: they were drawn to Italy as a symbol of culture and
   refinement, but also as a nest of corruption and bloody conspiracies.
   Italy had the function of offering a foreign background in which
   dramatists could safely address their hostility against the English
   court. This article highlights this fascination with the darker side of
   Italy in the revision of the trial of Vittoria Accoramboni in John
   Webster's The White Devil (1612). The story of Vittoria Accoramboni was
   so famous that many writers appropriated it and re-wrote it centuries
   after the fact: Stendhal, among others, reproduced the records of the
   time to offer a historical narration of the events in his Chroniques
   Italiennes - Vittoria Accoramboni, une oeuvre du domain public (1855).
   In his turn Webster seized the story, changing some elements such as the
   setting (he replaced Gubbio with Venice, probably because this town was
   better known to the audience), fictionalizing the love relationship
   between Victoria and Duke Brachiano, emphasizing the pandering influence
   of her brother Flamineo and especially adding his own view of the trial
   and how it was conducted.},

Title = {The Perceptions of Police-Black Civilian Deadly Encounters in North
   America among Black Immigrants in a Western Canadian City},
Journal = {SOCIETIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study investigates black immigrants' perceptions of police-black
   civilian deadly encounters in North America. Twenty semi-structured,
   in-depth interviews were conducted among black immigrants in Edmonton,
   western Canada. The respondents perceived racism, police brutality,
   black criminality, gun violence and police perception of black people as
   `violent' as the causal factors in deadly encounters. There was also the
   perception of criminal injustice and conspiracy among the agents of the
   criminal justice system (CJS) in the treatment of victims and suspects.
   This study suggests that personal and media experiences can influence
   how people de/re/construct deadly encounters and the treatment of
   victims and suspects by the CJS. Findings also reveal that when members
   of a racial (immigrant) minority perceive themselves as the target of a
   discriminatory CJS, they may adopt cautious and cooperative actions
   rather than aggressive or deviant behaviour to avoid criminalization and
   victimization. The study concludes that the perception of criminal
   injustice in police deadly violence against black (minority) civilians
   could influence: (i) where (black) immigrants locate themselves within
   the CJS in North America, and (ii) how (black) immigrants perceive and
   respond to the agents of the CJS, such as the police, when they
   encounter them.},

   producing subtraction maps at the 1 degrees angular resolution between

   the Galactic disk. The resulting V-W map revealed a non-acoustic signal
   over and above the WMAP5 pixel noise, with two main properties. First,
   it possesses quadrupole power at the approximate to 1 mu K level which
   may be attributed to foreground residuals. Second, it fluctuates also at
   all values of l > 2, especially on the 1 degrees scale (200 less than or
   similar to l less than or similar to 300). The behavior is random and
   symmetrical about zero temperature with an rms approximate to 7 mu K, or
   10\% of the maximum CMB anisotropy, which would require a ``cosmic
   conspiracy{''} among the foreground components if it is a consequence of
   their existence. Both anomalies must be properly diagnosed and corrected
   if ``precision{''} cosmology is the claim. The second anomaly is,
   however, more interesting because it opens the question on whether the
   CMB anisotropy genuinely represents primordial density seeds.},

Abstract = {By combining techniques of watermarking and fingerprinting, a sound
   buyer-seller watermarking protocol can address the issue of copyright
   protection in e-commerce. In this paper, we analyze the security of two
   recent anonymous buyer-seller watermarking protocols proposed by Ju et.
   at and Choi et. at respectively, and prove that they do not provide the
   features and security as claimed. In particular, we show that i) the
   commutative cryptosystem used in Choi et. at's protocol fails to prevent
   the watermark certification authority (WCA) from discovering the
   watermark (fingerprint) chosen by the buyer; ii) for both protocols, the
   seller can discover the watermark chosen by the buyer if he colludes
   with the WCA. Hence, these protocols cannot guard against conspiracy
   attacks. We further show that these protocols only provide ``partial{''}
   anonymity, ie. the buyer's anonymity is guaranteed only if WCA is
   honest. Our results suggest that the security of these protocols must
   assume the honesty of WCA, contrary to the designers' original claim.
   Finally, we propose a new anonymous buyer-seller watermarking protocol
   which is more secure and efficient, and provides true anonymity.},

Abstract = {I have assembled a diverse sample of galaxies from the literature with
   far-ultraviolet (FUV), optical, infrared (IR), and radio luminosities to
   explore the calibration of radio-derived and IR-derived star formation
   (SF) rates and the origin of the radio-IR correlation. By comparing the
   8-1000 mum IR, which samples dust-reprocessed starlight, with direct
   stellar FUV emission, I show that the IR traces most of the SF in
   luminous similar toL({*}) galaxies but traces only a small fraction of
   the SF in faint similar to0.01 L-{*} galaxies. If radio emission were a
   perfect SF rate indicator, this effect would cause easily detectable
   curvature in the radio-IR correlation. Yet, the radio-IR correlation is
   nearly linear. This implies that the radio flux from low-luminosity
   galaxies is substantially suppressed, compared to brighter galaxies.
   This is naturally interpreted in terms of a decreasing efficiency of
   nonthermal radio emission in faint galaxies. Thus, the linearity of the
   radio-IR correlation is a conspiracy: both indicators underestimate the
   SF rate at low luminosities. SF rate calibrations that take into account
   this effect are presented, along with estimates of the random and
   systematic error associated with their use.},

Abstract = {A positive COVID-19 infection may impact physical, mental, and social
   health. Different factors may influence these impacts on different
   levels due to personal circumstances. This study aimed to explore the
   impact of a positive COVID-19 diagnosis on the physical,mental, social,
   psychological health, and lifestyle practices of an individual in the
   United Arab Emirates. A sample of 28 participants was interviewed using
   online interviews. An interview guide was created based on the coping
   strategy model and conceptual framework of coping strategies. All
   interviews were recorded; then transcribed after obtaining written
   consent from participants. The NVivo software was used for thematic
   analysis based on both identified coping models. Major themes included
   the physical effects, social effects, psychological effects, spiritual
   effects, and lifestyle effects. Emerging themes include coping
   mechanisms, trust in authorities and the health care system,
   appreciation of the role of the government, conspiracy theories, and
   media roles. This study indicates that people diagnosed with COVID-19
   have perceived very good support in terms of their physical health from
   the government and health authorities, but require social,
   psychological, and educational support during the infection period and
   post-recovery.},

Abstract = {Does the public perception of governments' coronavirus pandemic
   responses actually make a difference to their electoral fortunes? In
   this research note, we answer that question by presenting the
   preliminary results of a survey of more than 3,000 voters in Croatia and
   Serbia conducted on a dedicated mobile app and web platform directly
   preceding parliamentary elections that took place in these two countries
   during the summer of 2020. This survey was part of our larger project
   tracking political competition, public discourse, and conspiracy
   theories in Southeast Europe during the coronavirus pandemic. The
   preliminary findings presented in this research note demonstrate
   Croatian and Serbian voters were rationally retrospective and rewarded
   parties in power based on evaluations of their crisis management
   performance. We also find evidence of voters who have personally
   witnessed the health consequences of the coronavirus being more likely
   to support the parties in power. We believe this is evidence of the
   coronavirus pandemic increasing affected citizens' expectations of and
   trust in national governments where those governments respond strongly
   to the pandemic's first wave, as was the case in both Croatia and
   Serbia.},

Abstract = {In response to the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, different
   religious-immune conspiracy theories emerged to explain the increasing
   scary situation in Nigeria. Emerging multifarious narratives of the
   contagion, which are embedded in peculiar Nigerian socio-religiosity and
   religious economy, reconstructed the discourses into two complexities:
   corona disease is an invention of the devil and other dark evil forces,
   and corona disease is a sign of the end of times. The obvious
   fabrications escalated uncertainties surrounding the pandemic as well as
   generated anxiety and fears among potential believers who sermonize
   spiritual vigilance for the `final battle and journey'. Drawing insights
   from critical discourse analysis, moral panic and frame theory, this
   study explores discursive means through which the pandemic is
   represented and reconstructed as long-awaited `doomsday' warning in
   Nigerian online communities. Findings reveal instances of varying
   descriptive names, lexical derivations and discursive frames that
   reflect counter belief and quasi-religious ideologies. The study argues
   that complex religious doctrines rooted in antichrist or mark of the
   beast view, socio-religious ideologies of dominionism and
   overcommernism, cultural and personal linguistic processes have all
   contributed in shaping and institutionalizing the viral `apocalyptic'
   world-view of the outbreak.},

Title = {Campaigns Against Emanzipatory Sex Education. Statement by the Academic
   Council of the Dortmund Institute for Sex Education (isp)},
Journal = {ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SEXUALFORSCHUNG},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73+},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This contribution considers the vehement criticism of emancipatory sex
   education in childhood and adolescence in fundamental catholic and
   evangelical circles and in particular the traditionalist sections of the
   popular rightwing party AfD as well as the corresponding online news
   portals in Germany and other German-speaking countries. In the
   statement, the central key words of the opponents -{''} opinions
   cartel{''}, ``early sexualization{''}, ``gender madness{''} and
   ``indoctrination{''} are examined. It is found that ideologically-guided
   imputations, defamations and conspiracy-theoretical assumptions are
   behind these terms. This comes about according to the observations of
   the authors with the sexual-political intention of creating uncertainty
   and fear in the population and in particular amongst parents by means of
   populist disinformation. As a result, the carefully achieved progress
   regarding the recognition of the equality of all people, their dignity
   and right to decide about their own sexuality, is called into question
   and endangered. The statement makes it clear that both the
   fundamental-religious and politically right-wing groups and individuals
   do not themselves actually have either a theoretically-founded concept
   of sexuality or any scientifically-founded sex education concepts.},

Title = {Resonant excitation of black holes by massive bosonic fields and giant
   ringings},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {We consider the massive scalar field, the Proca field, and the
   Fierz-Pauli field in the Schwarzschild spacetime and we focus more
   particularly on their long-lived quasinormal modes. We show numerically
   that the associated excitation factors have a strong resonant behavior
   and we confirm this result analytically from semiclassical
   considerations based on the properties of the unstable circular
   geodesics on which a massive particle can orbit the black hole. The
   conspiracy of (i) the long-lived behavior of the quasinormal modes and
   (ii) the resonant behavior of their excitation factors induces intrinsic
   giant ringings, i. e., ringings of a huge amplitude. Such ringings,
   which are moreover slowly decaying, are directly constructed from the
   retarded Green function. If we describe the source of the black hole
   perturbation by an initial value problem with Gaussian initial data, i.
   e., if we consider the excitation of the black hole from an extrinsic
   point of view, we can show that these extraordinary ringings are still
   present. This suggests that physically realistic sources of
   perturbations should generate giant and slowly decaying ringings and
   that their existence could be used to constrain ultralight bosonic field
   theory interacting with black holes.},

Abstract = {The presence in a family of a young child with AIDS, with the exception
   of a small number of transfusion-infected children, implies almost
   necessarily the presence of infected adults, usually the mother.  The
   problem in such a situation is not that of a child with a fatal illness
   but that of an entire family.
   Our study included a sample of thirty natural caregivers.  These were
   mostly mothers but others responsible for the care of a seropositive
   child, such as fathers, aunts and grandmothers, were also included.  The
   aim of the project was to describe their perceptions of their own
   psychosocial needs.  Our results reveal that these caregivers are
   economically disadvantaged.  They do not know how to cope with stress
   and their life situation.  They are not ready to confide in others
   because of the social stigma associated with this illness.  Thus they
   participate unwittingly in the conspiracy of shame which denies them the
   aid which might help meet their needs.  However, they do see the need to
   learn how to protect themselves and other members of the family against
   both HIV and other infections and to know the course and the treatments
   associated with this disease.},

Abstract = {Information disorder involves wide-ranging content that challenges
   democratic rules and social harmony. Pseudo-media that relies on
   conspiracy theories and misleading versions of the social reality
   contribute to feeding the disinformation ecosystem by reinforcing biased
   messages with expressive patterns and polarising practices. This article
   focuses on the content published (N=1,396) by seven far-right wing
   Spanish pseudo-media. Based on qualitative and quantitative methods, it
   analyses headlines, types of text and sources, as well as the distortion
   strategies of journalistic conventions. Results show that the emotional
   component is expressed by means of polarised headlines that rely on
   clickbait to gain attention and build a particular jargon, exacerbated
   by disinformation and populist practices. The absolute dependence of
   conspicuous headlines is evidenced by the limited resources of
   pseudo-media, whose production lies in a mix of opinion text and the
   processing of online content. Plagiarism from mainstream-mainly
   conservative-media, social networks and website siblings fuel these
   outlets that play the role of the ambiguity, mimicking journalistic
   conventions and mocking them by means of disinformation practices, with
   a particular focus on reframing social issues, progressive policies and
   measures to manage the pandemic.},

Abstract = {This article argues that in the spirit of their radicalism and desire
   for greater national and international equality for India's people,
   Americans Agnes Smedley, Frank Walsh, Robert Lovett, Gilbert Roe, and
   their American radical colleagues joined forces to fight for Indian
   nationalism in the United States in both a conspicuous and effective
   manner. They created petitions for American politicians, published many
   condemnatory news articles, took to the streets in places like New York
   City, and helped Indian nationalists in their struggles against the US
   government after the Indo-German conspiracy. This article also pinpoints
   an important intersection between anti-immigration politics against
   Indians and their support for enhanced rights for India's people in the
   United States. These anti-imperialist Americans broadened their fight
   against the US government by condemning xenophobic Congressional
   legislation designed to stifle Asian immigration to the US. By standing
   in support of India's nationalism and strife against British
   imperialism, they also recognized the problems that exclusionary
   legislation would create for the Indian nationalist movement in America,
   as well as ordinary Indian immigrants who were coming to America to
   create better lives.},

Abstract = {Background - Modern health worries (MHWs) are associated with various
   indicators of negative affect, conspiracy theories, and paranormal
   beliefs in healthy individuals.
   Purpose - The current pilot study aimed to assess MHWs and indicators of
   negative affect in patients with affective disorders (N = 66), as well
   as the possible associations between MHWs and paranoid and schizophrenic
   tendencies.
   Results - Compared to somatic patients, psychiatric patients showed
   higher levels of MHWs, somatosensory amplification, health anxiety, and
   somatic symptoms. Medium level associations between MHWs and paranoid (r
   = 0.35, p < 0.01) and schizophrenic (r = 0.37, p < 0.01) tendencies were
   also revealed. Somatosensory amplification (beta = 0.452, p < 0.001) and
   paranoia (beta = 0.281, p < 0.01) significantly contributed to MHWs in
   multiple linear regression analysis (R-2 = 0.323, p < 0.001).
   Discussion - High (i.e. pathological) levels of negative affect can
   impact a number of related characteristics. Non-pathological paranoid
   tendencies might contribute to MHWs. The identification of paranoid
   tendencies seems to be relevant for the treatment of psychiatric
   patients exhibiting MHWs.
   Conclusion - Patients with affective disorders are characterized by
   higher levels of modern health worries, health anxiety, and
   somatosensory amplification. Modern health worries are associated with
   paranoid tendencies.},

Abstract = {Speaking truth to powers-that-be and overthrowing a regime of lies were
   both dissident trademarks during the Cold War era. But what if
   overreliance on such an idealized and static notion of Truth can be a
   problem in an age of post-factual politics and information warfare? In
   this essay, I first problematize the idea that truth will set us free
   and re-read Vaclav Havel's The Power of the Powerless together with a
   contemporary workthe film Camouflage by Krzysztof Zanussito find other
   foundations for political strategies, beyond the struggle for truth,
   that might transcend the post-totalitarian situation and inform our
   normative choices and political agency today. In a reality over-flooded
   with information, where spreading doubt and forging counter-narratives
   has become a weapon, and where conspiracy theories seem to gain ground,
   relying on a self-evident distinction between Truth and Lies no longer
   has the power for political mobilization. It is individual
   consciencenesting moral and political responsibility within the
   individualrather than an externally existing Truth that might prove a
   more productive compass in a world of multiple vantage points and
   continuous re-interpretations.},

Abstract = {On 11 July 1960, the governor of Katanga, Moise Tshombe, announced that
   his province would secede from the newly established Republic of Congo.
   Soon after Tshombe's announcement, the white minority government of
   apartheid South Africa was accused by some political leaders and
   commentators of having formed an unholy alliance' with the secessionist
   state of Katanga, which lasted from 1960 to 1963. This alliance,
   described contemporaneously as a conspiracy between South Africa,
   Portugal, the Central African Federation and Katanga, was understood to
   have been intended to protect southern Africa's white settler societies
   from the spread of African independence and to safeguard the region's
   mining interests. The unholy alliance hypothesis has, however, never
   been substantiated. Based on archival material from South Africa, the
   United Kingdom and the United States of America, this article examines
   the unholy alliance' between South Africa and Katanga - it asks how and
   why the South African government operated as a regional power and
   decided to support the secession of Katanga. The article concludes that
   Pretoria acted on its own in a more cautious and ad hoc manner than
   claimed by the unholy alliance hypothesis.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF NEW RELIGIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-73},
Abstract = {In January 2004 the religious community of Knutby Filadelfia gained
   notoriety in Sweden after a young woman was shot dead and a young man
   seriously wounded. One of the pastors, Helge Fossmo, the husband of the
   murdered woman, was later found guilty of incitement or conspiracy to
   murder and was sentenced to life in prison. The actual perpetuator was,
   however, one of his mistresses, who was committed to psychiatric care.
   The case became subject to extraordinary media attention, with focus on
   the congregation's charismatic head pastor, (sic)sa Waldau, and the
   innovative teachings of the group. This article is based on a narrative
   analysis of an interview in prison with the former pastor Helge Fossmo,
   as a step towards understanding the psychological, social and
   ideological forces that may have contributed to the violence in the
   Knutby case. Narratives are culturally framed and draw on cultural
   resources, are socially constructed, and become consolidated by
   repetition. The narrative of Fossmo draws upon the cultural resource of
   the ``evil cult narrative,{''} as well as the social resource of his
   therapist, whose perspective is strikingly similar to the one Fossmo
   presents.},

Abstract = {The period of 1900-1903 saw three phases of cooperation between the
   Russian Secret Service (Okhrana) and King Alexander Obrenovic of Serbia.
   It is safe to say that the Secret Service operated in Serbia as an
   extended arm of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, i.e. of its
   diplomatic mission in Belgrade. Its goal was to fortify the position of
   Russia in Serbia after King Alexander's wedding and the departure of his
   father, ex-King Milan (who abdicated in 1889 in favour of his minor
   son), from the country. The Serbian King, however, benefitted little
   from the cooperation, because he did not receive assistance from the
   Secret Service when he needed it most. Thus, the issue of conspiracy
   against his life was lightly treated throughout 1902 until his
   assassination in 1903. In the third and last period of cooperation, from
   the beginning of 1902 until the King's assassination on 11 June 1903,(I)
   the Russian ministries of Internal and Foreign Affairs forbade the
   agents to receive money from the Serbian King and relieved them of any
   duty regarding the protection of his life.},

Abstract = {In 1984, Shamir {[}1] introduced the concept of an identity-based
   cryptosystem. In this system, each user needs to visit a key
   authentication center (KAC) and identify him self before joining a
   communication network. Once a user is accepted, the KAC will provide him
   with a secret key. In this way, if a user wants to communicate with
   others, he only needs to know the ``identity{''} of his communication
   partner and the public key of the KAC. There is no public file required
   in this system. However, Shamir did not succeed in constructing an
   identity based cryptosystem, but only in constructing an identity-based
   signature scheme. Meshram and Agrawal {[}5] have proposed an id - based
   cryptosystem based on integer factoring and double discrete logarithm
   problem which uses the public key cryptosystem based on integer
   factoring and double discrete logarithm problem. In this paper, we
   propose the modification in an id based cryptosystem based on the
   integer factoring and double discrete logarithm problem and we consider
   the security against a conspiracy of some entities in the proposed
   system and show the possibility of establishing a more secure system.},

Abstract = {Due to the unprecedentedly ubiquitous wireless computer networks and
   mobile devices become prevalent, more unscrupulous technology
   hacktivists commit illegal conspiracies towards innocent victims via the
   ever growing Internet technology. Indeed, cybercrimes are relentlessly
   reported worldwide. The law enforcement agencies have the indispensable
   responsibility to crack the well-funded crime syndicate in our computer
   society. Consequently, Digital Forensics (DF) emerges and becomes the
   critical success factor to prosecute the culprit and prevent the
   associate cybercrime incidents from occurring. In the meanwhile, the
   computer society has an urgent demand for competent DF professionals to
   gather convincing digital evidences to assist indicting heinous
   perpetrators in order to allay the fears of everlasting computer crimes
   events in both private and public sectors. The research provides a vivid
   roadmap and suggested core curriculum design guidelines for higher
   education institutions to be integrated into their existing similar
   program or adopting as a groundbreaking reference model. Aserial,
   cross-discipline, and functional approach were combined in order to
   design the suggested curriculum. Furthermore, the paper is attempting to
   minimize the theorypractice gap in DF and provide a milestone for higher
   education institutions to contemplate if necessary.},

Title = {BACK TO ISLAM? WOMEN'S SEXUALITIES AND BODY-POLITICS IN MUSLIM CENTRAL

Journal = {HAWWA},

Pages = {181-213},
Abstract = {In this paper I examine the commonly held assumption that the
   developments we witnessed in Central Asian societies since the
   disintegration of the Soviet Union could be interpreted as a ``return to
   pre-Soviet Islamic traditions{''}. I am specifically concerned with
   reports about the increasing violations of women's sexual rights and
   mounting control over their bodies, developments that are accompanied by
   a ``conspiracy of silence{''} about sexual matters.
   This essay is based on anthropological fieldwork in Kyrgyzstan, various
   reports from other Central Asian republics, a review of Soviet sex and
   gender policies, and analysis of Islamic Scriptures on the issue of
   sexuality. Even though some Muslim practices regarding sexualities can
   be seen as having a basis in the Qurhan, the interpretations and
   translations into daily practice are to a major extent influenced by
   political, economic, and socio-cultural forces. I trace these processes
   in the case of Soviet and postSoviet Central Asia and argue that the
   rhetoric of a ``return to Islamic traditions{''} does not take into
   account the significant impact on other forces on the current practices
   of policing women's bodies and silencing discourses on sexualities.},

Abstract = {Short tandem repeat (STR) markers are the DNA marker of choice in
   forensic analysis of human DNA. Here we extend the application of STR
   markers to Cannabis sativa and demonstrate their potential for forensic
   investigations.
   Ninety-three individual cannabis plants, representing drug and fibre
   accessions of widespread origin were profiled with five STR makers. A
   total of 79 alleles were detected across the five loci. All but four
   individuals from a single drug-type accession had a unique multilocus
   genotype. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed significant
   genetic variation among accessions, with an average of 25\% genetic
   differentiation. By contrast, only 6\% genetic difference was detected
   between drug and fibre crop accessions and it was not possible to
   unequivocally assign plants as either drug or fibre type. However, our
   results suggest that drug strains may typically possess lower genetic
   diversity than fibre strains, which may ultimately provide a means of
   genetic delineation.
   Our findings demonstrate the promise of cannabis STR markers to provide
   information on: (1) agronomic type, (2) the geographical origin of drug
   seizures, and (3) evidence of conspiracy in production of clonally
   propagated drug crops. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Recently, fingers have been pointed towards the impacts of social media
   platforms' algorithms. Although billed as transformative and democratic,
   most social media platforms are often in the headlines for disseminating
   ``conspiracy theories `` and ``fake news ``. However, the debate on new
   technology is not new. This viewpoint puts the current debate on social
   platforms in the context of the historical debate. In it, we firstly
   provide a comprehensive review of a seminal book by Neil Postman (1985),
   Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show
   Business. Although published decades ago before the introduction of
   today's social media platforms, the book is today a topic du jour.
   Secondly, we put the analysis from the review in the context of today's
   social media proliferations. The originality of this review is that it
   describes the impact of consuming technology without questioning it and
   that what we are witnessing is a shift from word-centered typography to
   image-centered social media. Postman calls this era ``the age of
   exposition ``, which gradually intoxicates academia and political
   discourses, thereby losing seriousness, clarity and value within public
   discourse.},

Abstract = {Since the declaration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic confirmed by World
   Health Organization, work on the development of vaccines has been
   stimulated. When vaccines are commonly available, a major problem is
   persistent vaccine hesitancy in many European countries. The main goal
   of our study was to understand the multidimensional factors inducing
   this phenomenon in Poland. Our study was carried out at the third wave's
   peak of the pandemic, with record rates of daily cases and deaths
   associated with COVID-19. The results indicate that vaccine
   hesitancy/acceptability should always be considered in an
   interdisciplinary manner and according to identified factors where most
   negative attitudes could be altered. Our analyses included the
   assessment of a representative quota sample of adult Poles (N = 1000).
   The vaccine hesitancy in the studied group reached 49.2\%. We performed
   stepwise logistic regression modeling to analyze variables set into six
   trajectories (groups) predicting the willingness to vaccinate. Apart
   from typical, socio-demographic and economic determinants, we identified
   the fear of vaccines' side effects, beliefs in conspiracy theories and
   physical fitness. We were also able to establish the order of importance
   of factors used in a full model of all impact trajectories.},

Title = {No one is immune to misinformation: An investigation of misinformation
   sharing by subscribers to a fact-checking newsletter},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Abstract = {Like other disease outbreaks, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rapid
   generation and dissemination of misinformation and fake news. We
   investigated whether subscribers to a fact checking newsletter (n =
   1397) were willing to share possible misinformation, and whether
   predictors of possible misinformation sharing are the same as for
   general samples. We also investigated predictors of willingness to have
   a COVID-19 vaccine and found that although vaccine acceptance was high
   on average, it decreased as a function of lower belief in science and
   higher conspiracy mentality. We found that 24\% of participants had
   shared possible misinformation and that this was predicted by a lower
   belief in science. Like general samples, our participants were typically
   motivated to share possible misinformation due to interest in the
   information, or to seek a second opinion about claim veracity. However,
   even if information is shared in good faith and not for the purpose of
   deceiving or misleading others, the spread of misinformation is
   nevertheless highly problematic. Exposure to misinformation engenders
   faulty beliefs in others and undermines efforts to curtail the spread of
   COVID-19 by reducing adherence to social distancing measures and
   increasing vaccine hesitancy.},

Abstract = {We study the radiofar-infrared (FIR) correlation in a sample of faint
   dwarf irregular galaxies using NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data for
   1.4-GHz radio flux, Spitzer Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) 70-mu m
   data for FIR flux and GALEX far-ultraviolet data to estimate the star
   formation rates (SFRs). Since our target galaxies are extremely faint,
   we stack images of many galaxies together to estimate the average radio
   and FIR fluxes. We find that for a given SFR both 70-mu m and 1.4-GHz
   fluxes are low compared to the calibration for large spirals. None the
   less, the ratio of 70 mu m to 1.4 GHz flux agrees within error bars with
   that seen for large galaxies. The radioFIR correlation thus appears to
   be the result of a conspiracy. We use the SFR to estimate the
   non-thermal fraction of the 1.4-GHz radio emission and find it to be
   around 50 per cent, much smaller than the 90 per cent typical for
   spirals. We also estimate the equipartition magnetic field and find it
   to be similar to 2 mu G, about five times smaller than that typical for
   spirals.},

Abstract = {Access control has been an important security issue in information
   systems. Multilevel hierarchical information access widely exists in
   present-day government, military, and business applications. Extending
   access control design to work in a hierarchical environment is natural
   and necessary but rarely addressed so far in the literature. In this
   paper, a dynamic group-oriented cryptographic scheme to access a
   multilevel data hierarchy is proposed. In the proposed scheme, a trusted
   central authority is in charge of the administrative activities among
   the organization hierarchy. At the beginning, each user class submits
   its associated information and a cryptographic key of its preference to
   the central authority. Next the central authority generates a public
   information for each class according to their location in the
   organization hierarchy. The cryptographic key held by each class can be
   used directly as an encryption key to encipher data. These keys need not
   be modified when adding/deleting a class to/from the system. Compare
   with other existing schemes, ours has the advantages of flexibility in
   choosing user preferred cryptographic keys, cryptographic keys not
   exceeding a fixed length, reduced storage space in publishing pubic
   information, and protection from conspiracy attack.},

Abstract = {Many in the West do not understand why Putin decided to attack Ukraine.
   Russian propagandists have thrown up a smokescreen, placing the blame on
   the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe, slandering the Ukrainian
   government as a `Nazi' regime, suggesting that ethnic Russians needed
   protection, or even insinuating a conspiracy by the West to destroy the
   Russian state and Russian culture. This article shows that there are
   deep underlying reasons for the invasion which are linked to how Ukraine
   and its history are perceived by Russian nationalists and imperialists.
   This article examines some of the historical justifications put forward
   by Putin and his views on Ukraine, Russia, and their history. The
   article gives an overview of some key moments of Ukrainian and Russian
   history and discusses the long shadow of the events of the 20th century,
   from initial Ukrainian attempts at state building to Putin's rejection
   of ideas of Ukrainian state- and nationhood. The article also analyses
   the impact the conflict has had on monuments and heritage sites,
   including the deliberate destruction of monuments and the capture and
   removal of artefacts and relics.},

Title = {Dangerous Stories: Narrative Theory and Critique in a Post-Truth World},
Journal = {NARRATIVE WORKS-ISSUES INVESTIGATIONS \& INTERVENTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {167-233},
Abstract = {Political and legal scholars use narrative theory to study everything
   from the framing of policy arguments to the telling of tort tales to the
   construction of political consciousness. Such scholarship often relies
   on post-positivist theories that problematize the empirical validity of
   narratives. But the stories told by many recent movements in American
   politics-such as Christian nationalism, ``the Big Lie,{''} and Covid-19
   conspiracy theories-so distort empirical reality that they endanger
   liberal norms and values, not to mention human lives. Scholars who
   ordinarily eschew objective narrative validity may nevertheless want to
   critique and challenge such stories on empirical grounds. This article
   investigates the options available to narrative scholars studying these
   types of stories. First, I survey different approaches to narrative,
   drawn from philosophy, rhetorical studies, critical feminist theory and
   critical race theory. Second, I highlight the resources and strategies
   devised by scholars who use these approaches to analyze other
   empirically problematic and socially dangerous narratives, especially
   how they have combined post-positivist commitments with concerns for
   truth and justice. Finally, I make suggestions for how scholars can
   better study and critique the political and legal narratives associated
   with the Trump era.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research is devoted to the criminological description
   and explanation of the state of illegal influence on the results of
   official sports competitions in Ukraine. A reading of the high level of
   latency of crimes according to article 369-3 of the Criminal Code of
   Ukraine, evidence that it is at least 99\% of its real level. The
   structure of match manipulation was revealed and analyzed according to
   the type of sport, the method of illegal influence on the results of
   official sports competitions, as well as the subjects of bribery. The
   characteristic of the corresponding structural units is given.
   Methodologically, the basis of the research is the dialectical method
   that serves to interpret social and legal phenomena through documentary
   sources. It is concluded that the most intense criminal match-fixing is
   practiced in sports such as football, futsal, basketball, and
   volleyball. Among the ways to encourage athletes to commit illegal acts,
   bribery predominates (75\%). At about the same level in terms of
   prevalence with small fluctuations in specific weight are structurally
   found ways to influence athletes such as incitement (10\%) and
   conspiracy (8\%).},

Abstract = {The paper is focused on the two most outstanding figures among the
   Jesuit missionaries in seventeenth-century China: Johann Adam Schall von
   Bell and Ferdinand Verbiest. Schall aimed to introduce the telescope
   into Chinese astronomy, which was traditionally based on naked-eye
   observation and calculation. With the advent of the Qing dynasty, he
   became head of the Mathematical Board and director of the Imperial
   Observatory. Verbiest was called upon in 1660 to assist Schall in his
   project of reforming the Chinese traditional calendar. The political
   situation changed in 1661, with the Empire ruled by a regency hostile to
   the Jesuits, as were most of the mandarins at the observatory. This was
   the difficult context of the famous dispute between Yang Guangxian, Wu
   Mingxuan, and the two Jesuit mathematicians to compare the merits of
   Western and Chinese astronomy, which lasted from 1664 to 1669. What
   happened was more than a scientific contest and a court conspiracy: it
   was a cultural confrontation between the Jesuits and the traditionalist
   side of the ruling elite, which regarded the Europeans and their
   increasing influence as a threat for the Empire.},

Abstract = {On 26 April 1901, members of the Righa tribe overran the French colonial
   village of Margueritte in central Algiers province. They seized the
   settlement's male colonists and demanded they `make {[}them]selves
   Muslims' by reciting the shahada and donning North African clothing.
   Several Europeans who could not or would not comply were killed. This
   article explores the meanings of this forced conversion of European
   settlers, which made the Margueritte revolt unique in the history of
   Algerian resistance to French colonialism. For French colonial
   officials, the religious ritual indicated the causal role of `Islamic
   fanaticism' in fomenting the revolt. Administrators and magistrates
   focused their investigations on the religious habits of the revolt's
   leaders, possible ties to Sufi brotherhoods and pan-Islamist
   conspiracies. But in doing so, they largely overlooked the more
   quotidian meanings of the conversion ritual for the inhabitants of
   Margueritte itself. By resituating the symbolic transformation of body
   and soul within the cultural logics of everyday life in the settler
   village, the article attempts to map out the more mundane social
   practices by which ethno-religious colonial hierarchies were enacted and
   embodied in French Algeria.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes two cases of manipulation within the spheres of the
   supreme authority of the sport of athletics, the International
   Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF). It shows the lack of
   historical and contemporary policies in the IAAF to combat manipulation
   in its sport. The study draws on previously unexamined historical
   sources from the IAAF Archive in Monaco and the Carl and Liselott
   Diem-Archive in Germany, as well as recent reports compiled by official
   investigators. First, the paper discusses the IAAF's handling of result
   manipulation at the 1987 IAAF World Championships long jump competition.
   At this event, the result of the final jump of the Italian athlete
   Giovanni Evangelisti had been manipulated. The subsequent internal IAAF
   proceedings on the case revealed major inconsistencies and difficulties
   and these are analyzed here. The paper then compares the Evangelisti
   debacle with the IAAF's involvement in the recent doping scandal in
   Russia. Despite worldwide changes in the international sport system that
   led to the introduction of international governance principles and
   wide-ranging efforts against manipulation in sport, the available
   evidence suggests that there was conspiracy and corruption in the IAAF.},

Abstract = {The American Revolution had a profound political, economic and social
   influence on the periphery colonies of the British Atlantic world,
   particularly in the Bahama Islands. The Continental Congress's
   imposition of a trade embargo against the British Empire drove island
   colonies, such as Bermuda and the Bahamas, to the point of starvation.
   Consequently, Bermudians and Bahamians petitioned the Congress for
   relief, offering military supplies in exchange for provisions, which led
   Congress to exempt both colonies from the embargo and form a general
   trade policy towards them. The American naval invasion of Nassau in
   March 1776, coupled with the ongoing trade between the islanders and the
   rebels, fuelled Governor Montfort Browne's fears of an internal
   conspiracy to bring the colony into the rebellion. These fears increased
   tensions between the governor, the Bahamian government and the
   inhabitants. Ultimately, the breakdown of the colonial government
   facilitated a planned coup d'etat by the council to overthrow Governor
   Browne, a short-lived dictatorship by the governor and the end of the
   Congress's trade policy towards the islands. The effects of the American
   Revolution on the Bahamas demonstrate that the imperial conflict
   influenced the periphery colonies of the British Atlantic.},

   through coup plots?},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},

Pages = {735-760},
Abstract = {The exposure of alleged coup plots in 2007 has shaken the guardian role
   of the Turkish military in politics. What were the conditions that led
   to the exposure of the coups and what is their significance for the
   future of Turkish democracy? Drawing on insights from southern Europe,
   the article argues that failed coup plots can lead to democratic
   civil-military relations especially if they work simultaneously with
   other facilitating conditions, such as increasing acceptance of
   democratic attitudes among officers, consensus among civilians over the
   role of the military, and the influence of external actors, such as the
   European Union. The article focuses on such domestic and international
   factors to analyse the transformation of the Turkish military, the
   splits within the armed forces and the resulting plots. It argues that
   one positive outcome of the exposed conspiracies in Turkey has been the
   enactment of new institutional amendments that would eradicate the
   remaining powers of the military. Yet, a negative outcome of the coup
   investigations has been an increase in polarization and hostility.
   Turkish democracy still lacks mutual trust among significant political
   groups, which creates unfavourable conditions for democratic
   consolidation.},

Abstract = {The work Tratado del descubrimiento de las Yndias y su conquista,
   written by the New Spain Creole Juan Suirez de Peralta around 1589, has
   traditionally been read as just another Conquest chronicle, scarcely
   interesting in its first chapters, but fully vivid in its ``second{''}
   part, where the author tells of the so-called conspiracy of Martin
   Cortes, Second Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca. This paper, however,
   suggests that the Tratado, in keeping with its title, must be read as a
   treatise in which Suirez de Peralta pleads for the legitimacy of the
   encomienda and offers an account of the fateful-as he sees them-
   consequences brought about by the Crown's rulings to suppress it.
   Therefore, the Tratado must be considered within the great debates of
   the time on how conquered peoples, conquerors and their descendants
   should be treated. Although not a professional lawyer, Suirez de Peralta
   turns out to be a resourceful and convincing writer. Far from offering a
   linear account of a series of events, he takes advantage of ambiguity in
   order to argue, from different viewpoints, on several issues. Sensing
   that he defends a lost cause, his allegation oozes irony, disillusion,
   and nostalgia.},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {30},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1057-1071},

Abstract = {This article profiles Dhiren Barot, a convert to Islam who was convicted
   in Britain in October 2006 on charges of conspiracy to commit murder for
   planning terrorist attacks in the United States and the United Kingdom.
   Upon his conviction, much of the British press, and many other
   observers, claimed Barot was a high-level Al Qaeda figure whose plans
   were on the verge of execution. Other observers, and Barot's defense
   attorneys, however, argued that these allegations were exaggerated.
   Barot, they claimed, had done nothing more than sketch vague plans for
   which he had no funding and was merely being used by the British
   government as an example in the War on Terror This article details
   Barot's life and terrorist activity. It argues that he was a committed
   jihadi, was likely an Al Qaeda member, and did indeed represent a
   security threat. Nonetheless, the lack of public information available
   on his life suggests that certain allegations about his status within Al
   Qaeda and the immanency of his plans should be treated skeptically. It
   concludes by considering to what extent Barot fits the profile of other
   Islamic terrorists.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {Automated social media accounts, known as bots, have been shown to
   spread disinformation and manipulate online discussions. We study the
   behavior of retweet bots on Twitter during the first impeachment of U.S.
   President Donald Trump. We collect over 67.7 million impeachment related
   tweets from 3.6 million users, along with their 53.6 million edge
   follower network. We find although bots represent 1\% of all users, they
   generate over 31\% of all impeachment related tweets. We also find bots
   share more disinformation, but use less toxic language than other users.
   Among supporters of the Qanon conspiracy theory, a popular
   disinformation campaign, bots have a prevalence near 10\%. The follower
   network of Qanon supporters exhibits a hierarchical structure, with bots
   acting as central hubs surrounded by isolated humans. We quantify bot
   impact using the generalized harmonic influence centrality measure. We
   find there are a greater number of pro-Trump bots, but on a per bot
   basis, anti-Trump and pro-Trump bots have similar impact, while Qanon
   bots have less impact. This lower impact is due to the homophily of the
   Qanon follower network, suggesting this disinformation is spread mostly
   within online echo-chambers.},

Abstract = {The presented article is based on a little-known text of the Ottoman
   chronicler `Izzet Efendi alDarandali. The court chronicler of the Grand
   Vizier presents a conspiracy version of the events of the Great French
   Revolution and the origins of the Egyptian expedition of Napoleon
   Bonaparte, the main role in which belonged to a certain ``Christian
   Antun{''} who fled from Egypt. Behind the archetypal image of the
   traitorous Copt lies not only a classic myth of traitor and betrayal but
   also a historical figure of the main tax collector of Egyptian customs
   Antun Cassis, who emigrated to Europe a few years before the overthrow
   of the French monarchy. The text allows a deeper understanding of the
   way of thinking of the elite of Ottoman society, the perception of the
   Turkish Ulema elite of the image of ``others{''} and ``strangers{''}, as
   well as the events that took place in Europe at that time. The story of
   `Izzet Efendi al-Darandali appears to be a strange mixture of
   traditional ideas of the Ottoman-Muslim society trying to adapt to the
   new realities of the reign of Sultan Selim III (1789-1807).},

Abstract = {This essay begins by exploring the difficult personal circumstances in
   which Pat Collinson completed his final book - suffering from cancer,
   far from Cambridge and with his private library largely dispersed. It
   examines how this return to the sources he had pondered for half a
   century allowed him to make one last effort to get inside the minds of
   the godly ministers and laymen whose struggle for the soul of the Church
   of England he had so long admired and struggled to understand. Now he
   explored them through a study of their close encounters with and battles
   against their greatest opponent within the Church's establishment,
   Richard Bancroft, in sequence chaplain to the Lord Chancellor, then
   bishop of London, and (from 1604) archbishop of Canterbury. It explores
   Bancroft's obsession (his `Moby Dick') with a supposed conspiracy of
   international Calvinism to take over Great Britain. The essay explores
   Collinson's empathy with Bancroft's puritan opponents and lack of
   empathy with his Catholic enemies, and concludes by finding much to
   admire in the heroic engagement with treacherous evidence that often
   misleads as to its completeness.},

Abstract = {This paper is a strategic intervention in the debate over the value of
   globalised gay identity for emerging sexual minority communities in the
   South. Focusing on self-identifying gay men in Botswana using
   semi-structured interviews, it explores their views of what
   characterises modern gay culture' and relates these to international
   media cliches of a glamorous, stylish, hedonistic gayness. I argue that
   identifying with what is so visibly a Western image of gayness exposes
   sexual minority communities to the most dangerous of the justifications
   for homophobia in Africa, the argument that sexual dissidence is a
   neo-colonial conspiracy to subvert African values'. The unAfrican'
   argument has to be taken very seriously, not only because it taps into
   the intense, conflicted emotions at the heart of the post-colonial
   condition, but also because it contains an undeniable germ of truth.
   This poses a dilemma, since global gay discourses, including the media
   cliches, are an important source of inspiration for African sexual
   minorities. A communication activism strategy is proposed to undermine
   the unAfrican argument by cultivating and asserting the tswanarisation'
   of gay culture in Botswana that is already taking place. A similar
   strategy may also be effective in other African societies.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the organizational structure and operations of
   Taiwanese organized crime and youth gangs in Southern California.
   In-depth interviews were used as the principle method of research. In
   contrast to transnational criminal conspiracy claims and the La Cosa
   Nostra model of vertically integrated organizations, our findings
   suggest that these criminal groups consist of discrete local Taiwanese
   youth gangs which operate as largely independent economic units that
   show no substantive and operational ties to criminal organizations in
   Taiwan. The formation of Taiwanese criminal organizations and gangs in
   Southern California is primarily governed by the availability of
   financial opportunities. Furthermore, both the inter-gang relations and
   intra-gang structures exhibit a distinct form of contractor arrangement
   which consists of market-like weak ties that are simultaneously
   circumscribed by the criminal embeddedness. We argue that that these
   economic weak ties, which seem to render conventionally understood
   criminal organizational boundaries administratively less meaningful,
   still function as an operationally significant governance mechanism of
   the organizational structures of American Taiwanese youth gangs. In
   addition, the paper discusses the implications that the embeddedness has
   on the somewhat paradoxical and incoherent organizational structure.},

Abstract = {The authors often talk about the moral and ethical predicaments they
   experience working with marginalized populations. But such
   conversations, confessions, and verbalized doubts happened in intimate
   settings, often with out office doors closed or when the hallways are
   quiet and empty. This is not a whisper of secrecy or conspiracy but one
   of self-reflexive contemplation about the privilege differential between
   the authors and the humans they encounter in the streets as they conduct
   action research or simple walk around as citizen observers. Through this
   dialogue, the authors attempt to capture some of the conversations they
   have had about the unspoken internal conflict faced by the scholars,
   including the authors, doing forms of action research with fellow humans
   who continue to suffer under the self-righteous ideologies of justified
   domination. The central force behind this dialogical article is not to
   offer solutions but to problematize the lack of narrative space and
   language for the colonialist reenactments every poverty scholar have to
   live with, even as they aim at decolonizing and empowering scholarship.
   The authors hope this dialogue is evocative enough to invite others to
   further explore similar dilemmas of decolonizing scholarship.},

Abstract = {The relation between cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and
   large-scale galaxy streaming motions is examined within the framework of
   inflationary cosmology.  The minimal Sachs \& Wolfe CMB anisotropies at
   large angular scales in the models with initial Harrison-Zel'dovich
   spectrum of inhomogeneity normalized to the local large-scale bulk flow,
   which are independent of the Hubble constant and specific nature of dark
   matter, are found to be within the anticipated ultimate sensitivity
   limits of COBE's DMR experiment.  For example, the most likely value of
   the quadrupole coefficient is predicted to be a2
   greater-than-or-equal-to 7 x 10(-6), where equality applies to the
   limiting minimal model.  If (1) COBE's DMR instruments perform well
   throughout the 2 year period, (2) the anisotropy data are not marred by
   the systematic errors, (3) the large-scale motions retain their present
   observational status, (4) there is no statistical conspiracy in a sense
   of the measured bulk flow being of untypically high and the large-scale
   anisotropy of untypically low amplitudes, and (5) the low-order
   multipoles in the all-sky primordial fireball temperature map are not
   detected, the inflationary paradigm will have to be questioned.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The circularity of information, enhanced by the technological and social
   advancement of media platforms, favors the greater reach of rumours,
   conspiracy theories and communication products that impact, above all,
   science. In this sense, the new coronavirus pandemic is a historic event
   with important consequences for humanity and presents, among other
   challenges, the need to disseminate credible information that helps to
   combat the spread of the disease. Studying how certain contents are
   echoed through the use of social networks opens the way to discuss how
   the public communication of science is articulated with the narratives
   circulating on the networks. It is from this context that the present
   study presents itself, by mapping the communication strategies in
   virtual social networks implemented by the University of Sao Paulo
   (USP), which, according to indicators, figures as the largest research
   producer in Brazil and second in Latin America. The content analysis of
   Facebook posts, published during the initial months of registration of
   cases and deaths from the virus, from February to April 2020, sought to
   understand the relationship between media communication and the
   responsibility of organizations that produce science for combat
   disinformation and denialist movements.},

Title = {Linked in the dark: A network approach to understanding information
   flows within the Dutch Telegramsphere},
Journal = {INFORMATION COMMUNICATION \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 14},
Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the stricter content moderation policies
   imposed by mainstream social networking sites (SNSs) stimulated the
   growth of low-moderated but relatively open discussion platforms such as
   Telegram. Despite Telegram's growing popularity among (deplatformed)
   digital exiles, and high potential for news dissemination, information
   consumption, mobilization, and radicalization, little is known about
   information flows with respect to politically and socially relevant
   topics within the Telegramsphere. We scrutinize the Telegramsphere as an
   information-sharing ecosystem of current affairs by uncovering how
   information flows indicated by content-overlap and shared users
   influenced the structure of Telegram networks and shaped communities
   over time. Using state-of-the-art web-mining, neural topic modeling, and
   social network analysis techniques on a unique data set that spans the
   full messaging history (N = 2,033,661) of 174 Dutch-language public
   Telegram chats/channels, we show that over time, conspiracy-themed,
   far-right activist, and COVID-19-sceptical communities dominated the
   Dutch Telegramsphere of current affairs. Our findings raise concerns
   with respect to Telegram's polarization and radicalization capacity in
   the context of consuming socially and politically relevant information
   online.},

Abstract = {In February 2020, the Bulgarian government established the National
   Operational Headquarters for Combating the COVID-19 Pandemic in
   Bulgaria. General Ventsislav Mutafchiyski, a military doctor, professor
   at the Military Medical Academy in Sofia, was appointed as its chairman.
   This paper presents a case study on the public image of Ventsislav
   Mutafchiyski, its readings and interpretations by the audience, and the
   specific fan culture that emerged around his media persona during the
   first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria. Placed in the spotlight
   of the media at the very beginning of the crisis, Mutafchiyski became
   extremely popular as the public figure most strongly associated with the
   fight against the spread of the disease in the country. Around his media
   persona, shaped in the public imagination as a wartime leader, a fan
   culture has grown with all its characteristic features and dimensions:
   fans and anti-fans, affirmative and transformative fandom. As a
   fictional character, Mutafchiyski has appeared in numerous forms of
   vernacular creativity: poems, songs, material objects, jokes, fake news,
   conspiracy theories, and memes. In this way, the General has become the
   main character of Bulgarian pandemic folklore and the focal point of a
   participatory pandemic.},

Abstract = {`Gender ideology' discourse has been one of the most recurrent
   strategies of neo-conservative activism at a global level. Through this
   syntagma, a variety of moral panics have been mobilized against feminist
   agendas and LGBTI rights, accusing them of promoting the destruction of
   natural order, the spread of Marxism and global conspiracy. The academic
   literature has highlighted that the genesis of this strategic discourse
   was an intellectual production in the mid-1990s; we can trace back texts
   written in conjunction by secular neo-conservative intellectuals in the
   United States and members of the Catholic hierarchy. However, the
   tendency has been to ignore the strong intellectual production that
   neo-conservative activists developed at that time in Argentina,
   particularly in Cordoba and Buenos Aires, which helped to lay the
   foundations of the present `gender ideology' discourse. The intention of
   this work is to draw attention to that local production and its
   connection with the ideas that were being developed in parallel in the
   global North. In order to do this, the article analyzes a series of
   texts produced by neo-conservatives in Argentina in the 1990s.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {``The Palestinian cause is not about land and soil, but it is about
   faith and belief,{''} insist Islamists in their attempts to Islamize the
   Arab-Israeli conflict. This paper examines the instrumentalization of
   religion in the conflict since its early stages, and its impact on Arab
   antisemitic discourses. It is based on an ongoing research project
   exploring references to the Jews in Arab, particularly the Palestinian
   and Egyptian, Islamist as well as nationalist media, during major
   landmarks in the conflict's history, from the Arab Wailing Wall riots in
   1929 up to US president Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the
   capital of Israel in December 2017. It contends that despite the
   intensified exploitation of Islam in the incitement against Israel,
   Zionism, and the Jews, and despite the traditional enmity towards the
   Jews as a group deriving from Islam, preliminary findings show that the
   most common themes in the Arab antisemitic discourse originate from a
   more modern, exogenous vocabulary and perceptions. Classical
   Christian-Western tropes, such as conspiracy theories epitomized in the
   Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Nazi terminology, and Holocaust denial,
   are extensively used and are much more pervasive.},

Abstract = {In 2016, archaeological excavations undertaken by the Ephorate of
   Antiquities of West Attica, Piraeus and Islands 3.8 km south-west of
   Athens, Greece, revealed mass burials of 79 skeletons in three rows. The
   burials are dated to the 7th century BC. The anthropological field
   documentation was undertaken by The Swedish Institute of Athens, and
   followed established bioarchaeological protocols regarding taphonomic
   processes, age, sex, injuries, and pathological changes. The
   descriptions and interpretations should be regarded as preliminary field
   observations. A majority of the individuals were young adult or juvenile
   males, most of them without signs of active disease and with a generally
   good oral health status, but with corroded iron shackles around their
   wrists. Cause of death could not be determined although extensive and
   likely perimortem fractures were observed. The only object related to
   injury and/or possible cause of death was an arrowhead found in the
   chest of one of the skeletons. Why and where the individuals were killed
   is a matter of conjecture; the observations from the field documentation
   neither validate, nor disprove the hypothesis that these individuals
   were captives and victims of the so-called ``Cylonian conspiracy{''} in
   the 7th century BC.{*}},

Funding-Text = {We are grateful to Dr Stella Chryssoulaki, ephor at the Ephorate of
   Antiquities of West Attica, Piraeus and Islands for inviting the Swedish
   Institute at Athens (SIA) to conduct a field documentation of the
   skeletons in the mass graves at Phaleron. Two Swedish foundations
   provided the necessary funding for the anthropological field
   documentation: the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences
   (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, project no. INT16-1143:1) and the Royal
   Swedish Academy of Letters (Kungl. Vitterhetsakademien); SIA provided
   additional funding for the field documentation and Gustavianum-Uppsala
   University Museum provided additional funding for the report. Sincere
   thanks to Dr Arto Penttinen, former director at SIA for inviting us,
   swiftly arranging the necessary funding needed for this work and for his
   immense support during the whole project. Many thanks to Dr Jenny
   Wallensten, current director at SIA for her commitment and support
   during the implementation and completion of the project. Research
   engineer Stefan Lindgren and Victor Lundstrom, Humanities Laboratory,
   Lund University made the 3D model with additional funding from SIA. Dr
   Anna Kjellstrom and Dr Maja Krzewinska, Stockholm University, were
   responsible for the sampling (aDNA, strontium, and 14C) funded by the
   Atlas Project (through Prof. Mattias Jakobsson) which will be shared
   with the Center for Bioarchaeological Research at the School of Human
   Evolution and Social Change of Arizona State University and the Malcolm
   H. Wiener Laboratory for Archaeological Science at the American School
   of Classical Studies in Athens. We thank the team of the Phaleron
   Bioarchaeological Project, especially Prof. Jane Buikstra, Center for
   Bioarchaeological Research, Arizona State University and Dr Panagiotis
   Karkanas, director of the Wiener Laboratory, for their excellent
   collaboration and advice. We are particularly grateful for the
   assistance given by the archaeologists Sevos Agouras, Ioannis Pappas,
   and Nikos Tsanteikidis, and the conservators Panayota Gioni, Tatiana
   Panagopoulou, Paraskevi Peteinatou, and Panagiotis Simotas. Thanks to
   the illustrator Konstantina Deli for all the plans, and to Ioannis
   Asvestas for the photographs. Thanks to the workers at the Phaleron
   excavation for sharing their expertise and for the stimulating

Abstract = {We show that spiral activity can erase pronounced features in disk
   galaxy rotation curves. We present simulations of growing disks, in
   which the added material has a physically motivated distribution, as
   well as other examples of physically less realistic accretion. In all
   cases, attempts to create unrealistic rotation curves were unsuccessful
   because spiral activity rapidly smoothed away features in the disk mass
   profile. The added material was redistributed radially by the spiral
   activity, which was itself provoked by the density feature. In the case
   of a ridge-like feature in the surface density profile, we show that two
   unstable spiral modes develop, and the associated angular momentum
   changes in horseshoe orbits remove particles from the ridge and spread
   them both inward and outward. This process rapidly erases the density
   feature from the disk. We also find that the lack of a feature when
   transitioning from disk to halo dominance in the rotation curves of disk
   galaxies, the so called ``disk-halo conspiracy,{''} could also be
   accounted for by this mechanism. We do not create perfectly exponential
   mass profiles in the disk, but suggest that this mechanism contributes
   to their creation.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {This article examines the writings of one of the key voices who
   influenced Anders Breivik: Peder Jensen. Writing under the pen name
   Fjordman, Jensen has developed a range of writings, some of which have
   come to operate at the interface between Islamophobic populism and
   contemporary fascist terrorism. To explore this interface, this article
   analyzes the various writings by Jensen/Fjordman that Breivik himself
   reproduced in his manifesto 2083: A European Declaration ofIndependence.
   It concludes that, while not directly instructing Breivik to carry out
   an act of terrorism, there is nevertheless a looser connection between
   Jensen's rhetoric, which points toward violent action, and the behavior
   of others such as Breivik. It explores this link through the lens of
   ``license,{''} a methodology developed by Aristotle Kallis. This
   approach allows the analysis to highlight that, beneath a veneer of more
   moderate anti-Muslim populism, the discourse Peder Jensen has written
   under the pen name Fjordman evokes many of the tropes of fascism,
   including coded endorsement of ethnic nationalism, misogyny, conspiracy
   theories, a concern with profound cultural decadence, and a palingenetic
   language that idealizes revolution coming about through war.},

Abstract = {The Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis in the Negro male is the
   longest nontherapeutic experiment on human beings in medical history. 
   The strategies used to recruit and retain participants were quite
   similar to those being advocated for HIV/AIDS prevention programs today.
   Almost 60 years after the study began, there remains a trail of distrust
   and suspicion that hampers HIV education efforts in Black communities.
   The AIDS epidemic has exposed the Tuskegee study as a historical marker
   for the legitimate discontent of Blacks with the public health system. 
   The belief that AIDS is a form of genocide is rooted in a social context
   in which Black Americans, faced with persistent inequality, believe in
   conspiracy theories about Whites against Blacks.  These theories range
   from the belief that the government promotes drug abuse in Black
   communities to the belief that HIV is a manmade weapon of racial
   warfare.
   An open and honest discussion of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study can
   facilitate the process of rebuilding trust between the Black community
   and public health authorities.  This dialogue can contribute to the
   development of HIV education programs that are scientifically sound,
   culturally sensitive, and ethnically acceptable.},

Abstract = {The earliest JWST observations have revealed an unexpected abundance of
   super-early (z > 10), massive (M-{*} approximate to 10(9) M-circle dot)
   galaxies at the bright-end (M-UV approximate to -21) of the ultraviolet
   luminosity function (UV LF). We present a minimal physical model that
   explains the observed galaxy abundance at z = 10-14. The model primarily
   combines (i) the halo mass function, with (ii) an obscured star
   formation fraction prescription that is consistent with findings of the
   ALMA REBELS dusty galaxy survey. It has been successfully tested on
   well-known UV LFs up to z = 7. We argue that the weak evolution from z =
   7 to z approximate to 14 of the LF bright-end can arise from a
   conspiracy between a decreasing dust attenuation, making galaxies
   brighter, that almost exactly compensates for the increasing shortage of
   their host halos. Our minimal model naturally reproduces the z = 10-14
   LF if galaxies at z greater than or similar to 11 contain a negligible
   amounts of dust. We speculate that dust could have been efficiently
   ejected during the very first phases of galaxy build-up.},

   beliefs in misinformation},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories related to COVID-19
   has represented one of the several undesirable effects of the current
   pandemic. In understanding why people can be more or less at risk to
   believe in misinformation, emotional distress and education could play a
   crucial role. The present study aims to analyze the relationship among
   depressive symptoms, education, and beliefs in misinformation about
   COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic. We do this through a
   cross-sectional study carried out on a random and representative sample
   of the Italian population that allows us to go and verify the
   co-evolution of many factors: i.e., beliefs in misinformation, symptoms
   of depression, perceptions about COVID-19, ways in which citizens got
   informed about the pandemic, and sociodemographic characteristics (e.g.,
   age, gender, education). The results show that the relationship between
   depression and beliefs in misinformation exists and is more complex than
   hypothesized because it is mediated by individual perceptions. In
   particular, the most at-risk people to believe in misinformation show
   higher bias perceptions, higher depression, and lower education.
   Practical implications are discussed suggesting a supportive
   intervention at both individual and social levels.},

Title = {Partisanship and the Politics of COVID Vaccine Hesitancy},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Has partisan polarization reached the stage that it now affects
   Americans' decisions whether or not to get vaccinated against a
   pervasive and deadly virus such as COVID-19? To date, the evidence has
   largely been hypothetical-collected before the vaccine was widely
   available-superficial, or contradictory. Using two original surveys
   conducted at two different time periods after vaccines became available,
   this study represents one of the first efforts to systematically analyze
   the role of party affiliation in predicting vaccine hesitancy. We find
   that even after controlling for a host of demographic and attitudinal
   variables, Republicans are significantly less likely-and Democrats more
   likely-to be vaccinated, to be willing to be vaccinated, and to
   recommend vaccination to a friend who asks for advice. In addition to
   these direct effects, we also uncover evidence that partisanship affects
   vaccine hesitancy indirectly through its influence on Americans' concern
   over COVID, belief in vaccine conspiracy theories, and trust in
   government, science, and the medical profession. These findings support
   the idea that policymakers seeking to increase COVID vaccination rates
   may need to engage in specialized outreach not only to specific
   socio-economic communities, but also to specific partisan communities.},

Title = {Predictors of third-person perceptions about media's influence on

Abstract = {Purpose The present study aims to unveil the main predictors of
   perceived media influence (the third-person effect (TPE)) on people's
   opinions towards COVID-19 vaccination. While the TPE has been researched
   before in medical contexts, predictors of TPE on the topic of
   vaccination against COVID-19 are understudied.
   Design/methodology/approach This study employs a national survey using
   an online panel (N = 945) representative for the online population of
   Romania aged 18 or higher; data were collected during 1-9 April 2021.
   Findings Results indicate that people perceive both close and distant
   others to be more influenced by media information related to COVID-19
   vaccination topics. TPE perception is correlated with belief in
   conspiracy theories about vaccines/vaccination, perceived incidence of
   fake news about COVID-19 vaccines/vaccination, perceived usefulness of
   social networking sites and critical thinking. Originality/value Results
   from this study might explain the success rate of some communication
   strategies employed with the help of the media. Key findings could be
   used as starting points for understanding the profile of those who
   underestimate the media's impact on themselves with respect to COVID-19
   immunization and for designing more successful media strategies.},

Abstract = {Social media has been integral for the organization and success of
   right-wing populist movements in the United States and Europe. Within
   online communities, discussions take place in which ideologies are
   formulated, iterated upon, and disseminated. One particular forum,
   hosted on the popular website reddit.com, r/The\_Donald, has received
   media attention for its political influence. Despite the influence of
   online spaces in populist, far-right movements, relatively little
   attention has been paid to qualitative content of discussions that take
   place within such spaces, including r/The\_Donald. Guided by a social
   representations approach, we analyzed how discussions on r/The\_Donald
   represent sociopolitical groups. We focused on discussions of political
   affiliations, race relations, immigration, and culture. From a dataset
   of 8,198 posts, we selected 1,292 segments from 883 unique Reddit
   usernames and analyzed them using qualitative content analysis. The
   results showed that the majority of posts discussed liberals, race
   relations, and conspiracy theories, and in these posts, liberals and
   liberal ideas were delegitimized and mocked through their
   representations. These posts represented conservatives through antinomic
   contrast and comparison to liberals and liberal policies. The meanings
   of those representations in intergroup relations are discussed.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the Delhi gang rape of 16 December 2012, the article
   describes the force of two aggregations by which the violence is carried
   out and representedthe raping mob and the mourning and protesting crowd.
   Even though all six members of the mob are arrested within three days of
   the rape, we find disparate and spontaneous crowd formations across the
   city, expressing their anger at police apathy and state indifference in
   securing public spaces. This article teases out the relationship between
   the mob and the crowd. As far as the mob is concerned I show how the
   trial court presupposes a bond that ties the members together. This bond
   is found in the elaboration of conspiracy' and dacoity'. This connection
   is further amplified through detailed forensic evidence, which channels
   the animacy of the rape into a medical-legal language of fact. In
   reacting to the rape crowd formations point us to the intensity of an
   egalitarian release. I follow Canetti's development of discharge' and
   sting, without which the crowd does not exist. Finally, I show how crowd
   formations intersect with public discourses drawn from visual reportage
   as well as the medical condition of the victim.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Vaccine scepticism is an increasingly important barrier to optimal
   coverage in developed countries. In this commentary, we make the case
   that negative attitudes towards vaccines reflect a broader and deeper
   set of beliefs about health and wellbeing. We suggest that this
   alternative worldview is influenced by ontological confusions (e.g.
   regarding purity, natural energy), and knowledge based on personal lived
   experience and trusted peers, rather than the positivist epistemological
   framework. Our view is supported by recent social-psychological
   research, including strong correlations of vaccine scepticism with
   adherence to complementary and alternative medicine, magical health
   beliefs, and conspiracy ideation. For certain well-educated and
   well-resourced individuals, opposition to vaccines represents an
   expression of personal intuition and agency, in achieving a positive and
   life-affirming approach to health and wellbeing. These core beliefs are
   not amenable to change - and especially resistant to communications from
   orthodox, authoritative sources. Although this view does suggest
   tactical improvements to messaging, we suggest that a better long-term
   strategy is to combine with other disciplines in order to address the
   root causes of vaccine scepticism. Vaccine scepticism is unlikely to
   thrive in a cultural context that trusts and values the scientific
   consensus.},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {The article deals with the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century
   development of early modern English apocalyptic thought which permitted
   the identification of the Enlightenment and its political manifestations
   in Revolutionary France with the prophesied Antichrist. The importance
   of this phenomenon is discussed and a framework for further discussion
   of it, taken from general theories of apocalyptic, is provided. However,
   the article is chiefly concerned to go beyond existing, inadequate
   explanations of the phenomenon, which advert merely to the French wars
   and certain contemporary conspiracy theories, and seeks its origins and
   relationships in wider currents of British thought in the period and
   before. Notably, reference is made to the concern of the insular
   Counter-Enlightenment with rationalist christological heresy, the
   continuing vigour of the English tradition of apocalyptic exegesis and
   to contemporary renewed theological and pastoral emphasis on
   supernatural and dogmatic religion. However, popular thought is also
   adverted to and the phenomenon is situated within the history of the
   ideology of the British ``ancien regime{''}. Throughout, the normality
   and acceptability of this apocalyptic thought in its contemporary
   setting is emphasized, implicitly suggesting a need to restrain
   historiographical emphasis on modernizing patterns of thought in
   treatments of the period.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The coronavirus pandemic has led to an explosion of hoaxes
   that mitigate the predisposition and speed of vaccination, especially in
   Latin America. This makes fact-checking journalism an option for healing
   the scientific conversation. Objectives: To analyze the characteristics
   and discursive axes of misinformation on COVID-19 vaccination in Latin
   America and the work of the fact-checkers. Methodology: Quantitative and
   qualitative research through content analysis of 113 misinformation
   extracted from LatamChequea Vacunas. Results: The countries that check
   the most are Argentina and Brazil, especially in the months of June,
   August and September. Fake content predominates, in text format, about
   adverse effects and application and efficacy, circulating on multiple
   social networks, with Facebook predominating. The activity of
   fact-checkers is not sufficient, as the rates of propagation are faster
   than those of checking. Also, they exhibit limitations such as the lack
   of identification of the disinforming subject, the contact with the
   sources involved and the deficiency of digital tools in the processes.
   Conclusion: Latin America has become a focus of misinformation on
   COVID-19 vaccination through ideological approaches promoted by
   denialist and conspiracy groups that undermine the credibility of the
   inoculation process.},

Title = {The relation between conspiracism, government trust, and COVID-19
   vaccination intentions: The key role of motivation},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {301},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Rationale: Vaccination willingness is a critical step in the effort to
   reach herd immunity and control the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless,
   many people remain reluctant to be vaccinated.
   Objective: Integrating the literature on Self-Determination Theory,
   trust in authorities, and conspiracy theories, this research examines
   (a) the direct and indirect effect of government trust and conspiracism
   via underlying forms of motivations for (not) getting vaccinated against
   COVID-19 and (b) whether these associations differ across the two
   largely politically independent Belgian linguistic groups.
   Methods: Using Structural Equation Modeling, we tested our models in two
   independent samples, in February 2021 (T1) and April 2021 (T2) (Total N
   = 8264).
   Results: At T1 and T2, Government trust and conspiracism both predict
   COVID-19 vaccination intention, respectively positively and negatively.
   These relations are fully mediated by motivational factors, with
   identified motivations having a larger positive contribution. Looking at
   linguistic context, differences emerge at T2, with French-speaking
   Belgians showing lower levels of government trust and higher levels of
   conspiracism than Dutch speakers.
   Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of integrating distal
   (trust in government, conspiracism) and proximal (motivational)
   variables to understand vaccination intentions.},

Abstract = {Pandemics and other crisis situations result in unsettled times, or
   ontologically insecure moments when social and political institutions
   are in flux. During such crises, the ordinary and unnoticed routines
   that structure everyday life are thrust into the spotlight as people
   struggle to maintain or recreate a sense of normalcy. Drawing on a range
   of cases including China, Russia, the UK, and USA, we examine three
   categories of everyday practice during the COVID-19 pandemic that
   respond to disruptions in daily routines and seek a return to national
   normality: performing national solidarities and exclusions by wearing
   face masks; consuming the nation in the form of panic buying and
   conspiracy theories; and enforcing foreign policies through social media
   and embodiment. This analysis thus breaks with existing works on
   everyday nationalism and banal nationalism that typically focus on
   pervasively unnoticed forms of nationalism during settled times, and it
   challenges approaches to contentious politics that predict protest
   mobilization for change rather than restoration of the status quo ante.
   In highlighting the ways that unsettled times disrupt domestic and
   international structures, this work also presents a first attempt to
   link everyday nationalism with growing work on international practices.},

Abstract = {This article argues that the institutional practices and journalistic
   ethics on RT, formerly Russia Today, have been influenced by the Soviet
   kontrpropaganda tradition, a defence mechanism against anti-communist
   narratives. RT's post-Soviet institutional structure has enabled the
   continuation of inherently `defensive' practices in a way that they form
   a `countering' ethic on the network. While kontrpropaganda informs the
   journalistic culture of RT's Russian staff, its international
   journalists are socialised into it. This article uses historical texts,
   archival materials and interviews with current and former journalists of
   RT and the Rossiya Segodnya network to examine how these defensive
   practices have become an everyday norm. In their strive for broadening
   the audience and for changing public opinion in the West, RT's staff
   adopts reactive, patriotic or legitimising practices. The countering
   ethic on RT informs the journalists' scramble for legitimacy not only of
   Russia as a country but also of RT as their employer. By analysing the
   underpinnings that organise the work of RT journalists, the article
   sheds light on broader problems of countering as a status-seeking effort
   in the international media ecosystem and contributes to ongoing research
   on self-censorship and conspiracy theories.},

Title = {Making Information Measurement Meaningful: The United Nations'
   Sustainable Development Goals and the Social and Human Capital Protocol},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Drucker's saying that ``What gets measured gets managed{''} is examined
   in the context of corporate social responsibility. The United Nations'
   Sustainable Development Goals have encouraged sustainability reporting,
   and a reporting tool, the Social and Human Capital Protocol, has been
   developed to assist measurement and provide information to support the
   achievement of sustainability. This information should be valid and
   reliable; however, it is not easy to measure social and human capital
   factors. Additionally, companies use a large number of methodologies and
   indicators that are difficult to compare, and they may sometimes only
   present positive outcomes as a form of greenwashing. This lack of full
   transparency and comparability with other companies has the potential to
   discredit their reports, thereby supporting the claims of climate change
   deniers, free-market idealogues and conspiracy theorists who often use
   social media to spread their perspectives. This paper will describe the
   development of environmental reporting and CSR, discuss the natural
   capital protocol, and assess the extent to which the Social and Human
   Capital Protocol is able to fulfil its purpose of providing SMART
   objective measurements. It is the first academic article to provide a
   detailed examination of the Social and Human Capital Protocol.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic uniquely represents an unprecedented health crisis
   that has permeated all aspects of human society. Given the technological
   affordances of social media to disseminate fact-based as well as
   purposefully misinformed and/or conspiratorial information, this paper
   examines the serious and strategic messaging on Instagram posts tagged
   with \#civilwar2. Results from a critical discourse analysis show that
   within modern American conspiratorial thinking and given the problematic
   politicization of COVID-19, healthy scepticism is replaced with
   conspiracy absent of theory. When extreme political and socio-cultural
   polarization occurs, this tendency is exacerbated by the bifurcation of
   meaning as expressed by those who seek to promote a particular angle of
   a given story or event. While this may be somewhat common in so-called
   old media, online in discursive spaces such as Instagram, the challenge
   to understand the mediated message is compounded by visual referents,
   which are often remixed to include adjunct information, such as mashups,
   hashtags, inserted text, or images, etc. Results include the
   identification of two main categories of Instagram memes tagged with
   \#civilwar2. These categories are analysed following three primary
   characteristics of discourse: genre, discourse/representation, and
   style.},

Abstract = {This article will examine the case of National Theatre of China, one of
   the most iconic buildings that have been looming in the skyline of
   Chinese metropolises in recent years. They are known to the Chinese
   public for their unprecedented, and often nicknamed, architectural
   types. Critics tend to deem such examples of contemporary Chinese
   architecture from recent waves of urban development as merely
   ``bizarre,{''} taking wacky building forms as the dishonorable outcome
   of a corrupt conspiracy between capital and politics. Instead of making
   a similar judgment, this article will discuss the case of the National
   Theatre as a wishful cultural practice in the context of a complicated
   sociopolitical drama. The discussion will elaborate on three core issues
   emerging in the transformation of contemporary Chinese public space: (1)
   how the meaning of the architectural ``face{''} changes as the urban
   ``body{''} is redefined, (2) how formal and technical means enhance or
   weaken the psychological impact that an innovative and adventurous
   building might have on its patrons, and (3) how rigid urban planning is
   reconciled with a more dynamic and active theatric space that turns the
   city itself into an improvised stage.},

Abstract = {The silent but constant work of the Fifth Column or clandestine Falange
   became another of the many enemies of Doctor Negrin's governments during
   the Spanish Civil War, increasing considerably defeatism mong soldiers
   and officers of the Popular Army and despondency in the rearguard. In
   direct contact with the secret services of the rival side, it carried
   out a continuous task of spionage and sabotaje in different military
   spheres, from the production of war materials to the repair of armament,
   including the tasks carried our directly in the Mobilization Centres,
   which prevented many youths from joining the front using ingenious mean
   sor changing sides in expeditions that were more and more frequent and
   numerous. The contribution of the Fifth Column can also be detected in
   the uprisings of Minorca and Cartagena, as well as in the conspiracy
   that derived into Casado's coup, and in the peace negotiations that
   started thereafter. The Second Republic was mined both from the outsine
   and from the inside. Franco had the ability to immediately identify its
   weaknesses. It was one more enemy, but it was invisible and,
   consequently, hard to beat both in the front and in the rearguard.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing has increasingly become a new model in the world of
   computing, and more businesses are moving to the cloud. As a
   cost-effective and time-efficient way to develop new applications and
   services, service aggregation in cloud computing empowers all service
   providers and consumers and creates tremendous opportunities in various
   industry sectors. However, it also poses various challenges to the
   privacy of personal information as well as the confidentiality of
   business and governmental information. The full benefits of service
   aggregation in cloud computing would only be enjoyed if the privacy
   concerns are addressed properly. In this paper, we investigate the
   privacy issues in service aggregation in a cloudenvironment and propose
   a privacy preserving protocol that is suitable for this environment. To
   demonstrate the security of our system, we construct a security game
   called IND-P3SAC-CPA and prove the security of the protocol accordingly.
   Our protocol has a distinct property that allows any service provider to
   obtain only the queried data under its conspiracy with the cloud.
   Additionally, the efficiency and various extensions are also discussed.

Title = {A Mixture of ``Cheats'' and ``Co-Operators'' Can Enable Maximal Group
   Benefit},
Journal = {PLOS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Is a group best off if everyone co-operates? Theory often considers this
   to be so (e. g. the ``conspiracy of doves''), this understanding
   underpinning social and economic policy. We observe, however, that after
   competition between ``cheat'' and ``co-operator'' strains of yeast,
   population fitness is maximized under co-existence. To address whether
   this might just be a peculiarity of our experimental system or a result
   with broader applicability, we assemble, benchmark, dissect, and test a
   systems model. This reveals the conditions necessary to recover the
   unexpected result. These are 3-fold: (a) that resources are used
   inefficiently when they are abundant, (b) that the amount of
   co-operation needed cannot be accurately assessed, and (c) the
   population is structured, such that co-operators receive more of the
   resource than the cheats. Relaxing any of the assumptions can lead to
   population fitness being maximized when cheats are absent, which we
   experimentally demonstrate. These three conditions will often be
   relevant, and hence in order to understand the trajectory of social
   interactions, understanding the dynamics of the efficiency of resource
   utilization and accuracy of information will be necessary.},

Abstract = {This paper will interpret and critically analyse the new offence for
   organised crime in England and Wales (Section 45 of the Serious Crime
   Act 2015) from a criminological perspective in light of evidence found
   in research in the country. It will argue that changes in the law relate
   to changes in political narratives rather than to variations in the
   criminal panorama of organised crime. It will discuss these changes
   within three perspectives, which address various levels of concern: a
   narrative perspective, which reflects on the overlapping of meanings in
   the use of the words `organised crime'; an evolution perspective, which
   reflects on the origins of the new participation offences with reference
   to both national and international pressures; a management perspective,
   which reflects on some of the immediate effects of the new offences of
   organised crime on the criminal justice system. This paper will conclude
   that political narratives have indeed influenced criminal policy, while
   there is no significant change in the phenomenon of organised crime to
   justify such narratives.},

Abstract = {Much that has been written on evangelicals in the United States concerns
   their impact on domestic politics. But the election of George W. Bush
   has resulted in a new importance for the relationship between
   evangelicals and US foreign policy. This has become particularly clear
   following the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and
   the Pentagon. Three issues deserve further study. One is evangelicals'
   attitude to Islam. The second involves the relationship between
   evangelicals and Israel. The third concerns the stance of evangelicals
   towards war with Iraq. Through an examination of these three issues,
   Durham explores a number of important questions, ranging from the
   relationship of evangelicals' theology and their politics to their
   partly supportive, partly critical attitude towards an administration
   itself led by an evangelical. Many evangelicals see the `war against
   terror' as a war against Islam and unreservedly approve of Israeli
   policy, and many supported the launch of war in Iraq. Yet evangelicalism
   is not a monolith and, with regard to its disputes over how to respond
   to the `threat' of Islam or what view to take of the Israel-Palestine
   conflict, Durham offers new insights into a powerful voting bloc and
   source of pressure within US politics.},

Abstract = {The 2001-2002 Argentine financial crisis entailed a dramatic currency
   devaluation. I argue that the devalued peso served as a key site for
   self-reflexive national critiques, which circulated as a privileged
   currency of middle-class distinction. This essay engages with the
   ambivalences of a world of critical practice in which practitioners
   framed their own critiques as the compulsory labor of a people trapped
   by a paradoxical monetary reality, posited as socially constructed yet
   nonetheless inescapable. Tracing the links among disparate modes of
   signification and evaluation, the essay sketches a post-crisis,
   middle-class representational economy predicated on these practices of
   suspicious interpretation.},

Abstract = {Developing and strengthening systems for information sharing as well as
   detecting and addressing dis/misinformation can not only protect
   capacity for public health emergency preparedness and response, but
   potentially increase overall community resilience and social capital.
   More actively involving citizens in the government's collection and
   sharing of information can generate more public buy-in so people will be
   more invested in making certain that such information is not arbitrarily
   dismissed or drowned out by conspiracy theories. Such an approach may
   have the added the benefit of creating stronger collaborative
   connections between government, individual citizens, and civic
   organizations to promote overall resilience. More community involvement
   in terms of the collection and dissemination of information can provide
   value in terms of preparation for a public health emergency by
   bolstering surveillance efforts to detect a threat early on. Getting the
   public more integrated into the public health information system can
   also be valuable in terms of diminishing the threat of
   mis/disinformation. Building up relationships between the public and the
   public health sector can advance the mission of improving community
   resilience through education, engagement, and collaboration. In this
   review, we will examine existing evidence for this approach and will
   then conclude with possible new approaches.},

Abstract = {The personal archive of the writer Lygia Fagundes Telles (1923-) from
   Sao Paulo is part of the Institute Moreira Salles' collection since
   2004. The present paper deals with the rich source for studies
   concerning lygian works, as well as it describes the content and discuss
   its cataloging. The purpose here is to make a critical research of this
   writer archive treasure, focusing on the observation of object groups in
   the collection set, such as the thirteen letters written by the French
   writer and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986). Through the
   analytical study of the Brazilian writer's personal correspondence,
   which includes the theories on personal archives and genetic criticism
   regarding the letter, this paper connects the dossier located at IMS to
   Lygia Fagundes Telles' fictional works, sticking out the writer's
   constant movement to maintain herself-memory into her writings. The
   author of Clouds Conspiracy has conceived another mysterious project,
   during her life, keeping under the care of an institution with free
   access her manuscripts, the letters changed with her friends literary
   set, and other texts which she considered as having a general interest
   for the knowledge of her works. The implied sense of this project is
   studied here.},

Abstract = {As an ultraconservative activist and occasional political candidate in
   Texas, J. Evetts Haley registered few electoral victories. However, his
   far-right crusades revealed nationwide right-wing discontent within the
   Democratic Party and delineated the anti-statist contours of
   ultraconservatism from the 1930s through the 1960s. Haley's combination
   of white supremacy, conspiracy theories, anti-statist populism, and
   rugged individualism reflected the extremities of agrarianism, Cold War
   anti-communism, and Old Right conservatism. Put simply, Haley
   constituted an explanatory link bridging anti-New Deal ultraconservatism
   and the mid-century conservative movement; in addition, he represented a
   point of convergence between Sunbelt reactionaries and mainstream
   conservatism. In 1936 Haley chaired the Jeffersonian Democrats of Texas,
   a state chapter of a national organization that sought to defeat
   Roosevelt by supporting Republican Alf Landon, despite the predominance
   of the Texas Democratic Party. The Jeffersonian's failure forecast the
   electoral inefficacy-but grassroots appeal-of mid-century far-right
   conservatism. During the 1950s Haley fomented fringe movements through
   his gubernatorial candidacy and the ultraconservative group Texans For
   America (TFA), but his hardline platforms restricted the success of
   both. Haley's time with TFA elicited his most fruitful activism, but his
   attacks against Lyndon Johnson in 1964 cemented Haley as a national
   far-right icon.},

Abstract = {Previously theorised as vehicles for expressing progressive dissent,
   this article considers how political memes have become entangled in the
   recent reactionary turn of web subcultures. Drawing on Chantal Mouffe's
   work on political affect, this article examines how online anonymous
   communities use memetic literacy, memetic abstraction, and memetic
   antagonism to constitute themselves as political collectives.
   Specifically, it focuses on how the subcultural and highly reactionary
   milieu of 4chan's /pol/ board does so through an anti-Semitic meme
   called triple parentheses. In aggregating the contents of this peculiar
   meme from a large dataset of /pol/ comments, the article finds that
   /pol/ users, or anons, tend to use the meme to formulate a nebulous
   out-group resonant with populist demagoguery.},

Journal = {ASTERION-PHILOSOPHIE HISTOIRE DES IDEES PENSEE POLITIQUE},
Year = {2021},
Number = {24},
Abstract = {From the end of the 18th century to 1830, Hispanic America entered the
   era of Atlantic revolutions. On the shores of Venezuela in the 1790s,
   the echoes of the French revolutions in Santo Domingo and other West
   Indian islands contributed to the flowering of revolts and conspiracies
   with new slogans. The demands for freedom for slaves and equality for
   mestizos were now part of a new horizon of revolutionary expectation.
   However, the Hispanic monarchy was still able to mobilise troops in
   defence of the established order. From 1806 onwards, the Venezuelan
   Francisco de Miranda, a former general in the French Revolution, tried
   to coordinate the efforts of the first independence fighters, although
   without success. The first independence was proclaimed in Caracas in
   1811 within a context of dislocation of the Hispanic monarchy following
   the invasion of Napoleonic troops and conflicts between the Spanish and
   Hispanic Americans. The patriots proclaimed civil equality by putting an
   end to the socio-racial categories of the Ancien Regime, whilst
   maintaining slavery. Only gradually did they incorporate slaves into the
   armies in exchange for freedom. Despite these armed liberations, the
   alliance with Haiti and the attempts of Simon Bolivar, independence did
   not coincide with the abolition of slavery that was finally proclaimed
   in Venezuela in 1854.},

   Religious Tolerance and (Re) Proselytism in India Today},
Journal = {SURVEILLANCE \& SOCIETY},

Volume = {16},
Number = {4, SI},

Abstract = {An individual is enveloped today by a vast network of automated,
   integrated, globalised, and ubiquitous surveillance that sweeps into all
   spheres of one's life. One's religious adherences and practices are no
   exception to this. The surveillance of religion, seen globally today, is
   yet another intrusion into the lives of people in India. Recently, it
   has taken on another dimension as issues of proselytism (conversion) and
   the movement of ``Ghar Wapsi{''} or homecoming (reconversion)
   increasingly endanger the peaceful coexistence of India's population.
   Growing religious intolerance to religious minorities under the
   influence of Hindutva-an ideological persuasion to establish the
   hegemony of Hindu beliefs and way of life-increases this distorted
   behaviour and encourages Hindu fundamentalism. This paper investigates
   this issue of state surveillance of religious minorities, focusing on
   certain political conspiracies and the perverted behaviour of some
   religious fundamentalist groups operating behind the veneer of
   constitutional secularism and state-determined coercive power control.
   With an analytical and critical discourse methodology, this paper argues
   that minority religious communities in India are key targets of
   surveillance and subject to manipulative (political and religious)
   interests that go against Indian liberalism. Thus, we find in the Indian
   case a categorical dissimilarity with the West regarding the focus of
   religious surveillance.},

Title = {Problem with No Name: Ageing and Age Identity in Wendy Wasserstein's
   Plays},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE LITERATURE AND CULTURE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {3},
Pages = {200-217},
Abstract = {This paper relies on a feminist perspective on ageing to analyse Wendy
   Wasserstein's plays. The Pulitzer-Prize winner Wendy Wasserstein
   (1950-2006) is good at dramatising the experience of women, especially
   their experience of ageing anxiety and ageing crises in their middle
   age. Their quest for identity is problematised in the paper in order to
   show the fluidity of identity through the passage of time and to
   represent human life as a continuity. The paper first studies feminist
   writings about ageing. It asserts that ageing is socially and culturally
   constructed, instead of biological in nature, and it also argues that
   women suffer more from the conspiracy of ageism and sexism. Then the
   paper focuses on Wasserstein's The Sisters Rosensweig (1991) to examine
   the influence of the ageing process for middle-aged women and the way
   they re-identify themselves. Wasserstein also depicts different
   experiences of female ageing in Isn't It Romantic (1983), The Heidi
   Chronicles (1988), An American Daughter (1997), and Third (2005), which
   constitutes the third section of the paper. Finally, the paper concludes
   that Wasserstein's plays demonstrate a feminist analysis of ageing,
   illustrate diversity of ageing experience, and remind us about social
   differences in the understanding of female ageing.},

Title = {Sacrificial Kings and Martyred Rebels: Charles and Rainborowe Beatified},
Journal = {ETUDES EPISTEME},
Year = {2011},
Number = {20},
Abstract = {In a dramatic end to Civil War, in January 1649, England witnessed the
   public execution of Charles I. After this event, the iconography of
   `Charles the Martyr' was frequently used to explicate royalist grief,
   and to comprehend the execution of the anointed king. This essay
   addresses three dramatic works that were printed in the aftermath of
   regicide to examine how they respond to the execution and engage with
   martyrological discourse. Whereas A Tragi-comedy Called New-Market Fayre
   (1649) focuses upon the sale of the late king's goods to flirt with
   notions of reliquary and address the value of the monarch's material
   goods, The Famous Tragedie of Charles I (1649) narrates the regicide and
   styles Charles a martyr. However, the discourse is destabilised by the
   appearance of Colonel Rainborowe, a radical parliamentarian who was also
   depicted as a martyr by his supporters. At the Restoration, The Famous
   Tragedie was revised to celebrate the death of Oliver Cromwell.
   Cromwell's Conspiracy (1660) presents the regicide as pre-figuring
   future royalist suffering before the triumphal restoration of the
   monarchy. These conflicting iconographies complicate our understanding
   of matyrological discourse and how it might be adopted as a way to
   understand the 1649 regicide.},

Abstract = {This text is an attempt to depict the broad theme of Polish women's
   involvement within the structures of the Polish Victory Service, the
   Union for Armed Struggle and the Home Army (SZP/ZWZ/AK) in years
   1939-1945. In the first part, it discusses the involvement of women in
   the struggle for independence, and subsequently in its defence in the
   years 1914-1921. In the second part, it examines the tasks conducted
   under the auspices of the Women's Military Service and related
   organisations in the preparation of women for the upcoming war in
   defence of independence, finishing with a brief description of women's
   participation in the Polish campaign of 1939. The third part is devoted
   to the formal place of female soldiers both within the structures of the
   SZP-ZWZ-AK, and broadly - Polish Armed Forces in general. The fourth
   shows female soldiers' involvement within the military structure of the
   Polish Underground State on specific individual examples.},

Title = {Allegations Made against Dominion Voting Systems and the 2020
   Presidential Election in Wisconsin},
Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {247-267},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {One of most extensive allegations of vote manipulation in the 2020
   presidential election revolved around technology manufactured by
   Dominion Voting Systems. In particular, then-incumbent president Donald
   Trump claimed in the election's aftermath that Dominion machines used
   across the country led to the deletion of millions of votes cast for
   him. Given the number of jurisdictions across the United States that
   rely on Dominion technology, this is conceivably a very damaging claim.
   To assess the allegation against Dominion, this article draws on
   election returns from Wisconsin, a state in which many municipalities
   changed voting technologies between the 2016 and 2020 general elections,
   some switching to Dominion technology prior to 2020 and others
   transitioning away from it. Holding jurisdiction features constant,
   there is no evidence in Wisconsin that Trump's 2020 vote share was low
   in jurisdictions using Dominion technology in 2020, and there is
   similarly no evidence that Republican congressional candidates in
   Wisconsin had lower vote share in jurisdictions with Dominion technology
   in 2020. Wisconsin thus offers no evidence that Dominion voting
   technology harmed Donald Trump in 2020 and thus no evidence that the
   allegation of vote manipulation leveled against Dominion Voting Systems
   was anything but a conspiracy theory.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic tempted some governments to promise to wage
   ``war{''} against it and implement ``world-beating{''} control
   mechanisms. In view of their limited success, such claims soon came in
   for massive criticism, which turned their hyperbolic implicatures and
   figurative framing against them. Our paper focuses on such cases of
   ``metaphor reversal{''} within the context of the British public debate.
   Drawing on examples from a corpus of media texts, we identify several
   types of the dissociation, including irony (i.e., putting the figurative
   claims' implicatures in doubt implicitly), sarcasm (i.e., explicitly
   decrying their plausibility) and satire (i.e., exhibiting their presumed
   absurdity), with reference to theory models of irony (echo, pretense,
   mental space structuring).
   In conclusion, we argue that the seesaw of exchanges between exaggerated
   figurative claims of (imminent) success made by government politicians
   and their sarcastic-satirical debunking by media and opposition
   politicians has an ambivalent effect on public discourse. On the one
   hand, it highlights contrasts in policy and policy assessment and may
   also have entertainment value, but on the other hand, it conveys
   experiences of repeated, serial exposure of hyperbolic government
   rhetoric. This in turn may lead to an erosion of trust in official
   communication as being unrealistic, which may foster beliefs in
   conspiracy theories.},

   for Facebook, which provided video testimonials from peer role models
   recommending vaccination and its benefits while providing psychological
   inoculation through the models' acknowledging misinformation, rejecting
   it and receiving the vaccine. These ads were paid to appear on Facebook
   users' feeds in rural counties in South Texas, along with a generic
   vaccine promotion ad from the CDC without peer models or psychological
   inoculation. Ad viewers could click a link to `find a vaccine near you';
   these responses served as the outcome variable for assessing
   experimental effects. Ads featuring peer modeling with psychological
   inoculation yielded a significantly higher rate of positive responses
   than CDC ads (30.5 versus14.9/1000 people reached in English and 49.7
   versus 31.5/1000 in Spanish; P < 0.001 for both English and Spanish rate
   comparisons). This provides useful pilot data supporting the hypothesis
   that theory-based communication, i.e. peer modeling with psychological
   inoculation, may be more effective than more traditional forms of
   advertising for promoting coronavirus vaccination.},

   Worldwide Far-Right Populism},

Abstract = {A time of turmoil and uncertainty is invading the public sphere. Under
   the framework of the 2020 US elections, populist leaders around the
   world supported Trump's speech on Twitter, sharing a common ideology and
   language. This study examines which issues (issue frame), and strategies
   (game frame) framed the messages of populism on Twitter by analyzing the
   equivalences through Trump's storytelling and checking the bias of the
   media in the coverage of the US elections. We selected a sample of
   tweets (n = 1497) and digital front pages of global newspapers (n = 112)
   from the date of the Trump/Biden face-to-face debate (29 September 2020)
   until the Democratic party candidate was proclaimed the winner of the
   elections by the media (7 November 2020). Using a content analysis
   method based on triangulation (quantitative and qualitative-discursive),
   we analyzed the Twitter accounts of five leaders (@realDonalTrump,
   @MLP\_officiel, @matteosalvinimi, @Santi\_ABASCAL, and @Jairbolsonaro)
   and five digital front pages (The New York Times, O Globo, Le Monde, La
   Repubblica, and El Pais). The results show that populist politicians
   reproduced the discourse of fraud and conspiracy typical of Trump's
   politics on Twitter. The negative bias of the media was also confirmed,
   giving prominence to a rhetoric of disinformation that overlaps with the
   theory of populism.},

Abstract = {In reviewing the Great Reset, an initiative launched by the World
   Economic Forum (WEF) in response to the global coronavirus crisis, this
   perspective article considers the scenario of an epochal transition from
   capitalism to ?restorism?. To facilitate the observation of underlying
   trends and assumptions, a systems-theoretical framework is developed for
   the observation of both this Great Reset scenario and those scenarios
   that are by implication excluded by the WEF vision. It is thus shown
   that the ?shared goals? advocated by the WEF would converge to a
   transition from a modern pluralist to a ?new-normative? order stratified
   to the primacy of individual, institutional, and planetary health. In
   discussing sociological implications of this transition, a vision
   emerges of a new digitally enhanced medieval era where health plays the
   role once played by religion. In this restorist scenario of a
   neo-medieval world health society, the emergence of new social strata
   corresponding to different levels of purity, infection, or pollution
   would be a probable consequence. The paper concludes that idea of
   deliberately caused great resets and other control illusions nurtured by
   the WEF initiative are barely smarter than and spur what the UN
   Secretary-General refers to as ?wild conspiracy theories?.},

Abstract = {The author analyzes relations between union structures, the office of
   the President of the USSR, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and the CPSU and its
   participation in the events of August 1991. Special attention is paid to
   the preparation of the new Union Treaty, including Gorbachev's
   participations, and the work of the April and July Plenums of the 1991
   CPSU Central Committee. The majority of the Secretariat of the CPSU
   Central Committee was not aware of the preparation of the coup d'etat,
   but showed extreme passivity during the coup, such as not openly
   condemning the Emergency Committee. This gave rise to accusations of the
   Party in aiding the conspiracy, and Boris Yeltsin's decree suspending
   the activities of the Russian Communist B. N. Party. The dismantling of
   Party structures after the failure of the coup allowed B. N. Yeltsin to
   proceed with the dismantling of the USSR. Actions of the State Emergency
   Committee frustrated the signing of the new Union Treaty, thereby
   predetermining the collapse of the USSR. In turn, M.S. Gorbachev did not
   use all his constitutional powers to prevent that collapse. The work is
   based on a wide range of sources, including unpublished archival
   materials and interviews with participants in events.},

Abstract = {This article considers the cultural positioning of transparency as a
   superior form of disclosure through a comparative analysis with other
   forms. One, as yet under-examined appeal of transparency lies in its
   promise to circumvent the need for, and usurp the role of,
   narrative-interpretive forms of disclosure such as scandal, gossip, and
   conspiracy theories. This growing preference for transparency as a more
   enlightening, honorable mode of disclosure is not just a result of the
   positive qualities that are seen to be intrinsic to transparency
   (particularly e-transparency) itself, but a response to the perceived
   negative characteristics of other forms of disclosure. After questioning
   the opposition between transparency and narrative-interpretive
   disclosures, we can see the preference for the former to be, at least
   partly, ideological: Transparency reinforces neoliberal tenets as much
   as democratic ideals. WikiLeaks is invoked in this article as a case
   which draws on both e-transparency and narrative-interpretive forms of
   disclosure in a move that wrests transparency from the clutches of
   neoliberalism and refuses the traditional hierarchy between forms of
   disclosure. This hybrid form helps us explore the possibility and
   implications of non-ascendant, radical forms of transparency or, in
   other words, disclosure without political foreclosure.},

Abstract = {This article examines the character of John Hynde Cotton, a leading tory
   opponent of Sir Robert Walpole, who played a particularly puzzling role
   in the conspiracies behind the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, and the
   parliaments of George II. Entering a coalition ministry in 1744, he was
   immersed at the same time in intrigue with the exited Stuart court, and
   at one stage pledged to use resignation from government as the signal
   for rebellion. The article explores the background to his career,
   tracing the intellectual, professional and kinship networks into which
   he was pressed, and their impact on his political commitments. Cotton's
   views on government and society were the product of a man caught up in a
   conflict between image and reality, torn between a set of different
   identities: robust doyen of rural squiredom, political and commercial
   `insider', scholar, and ideologue shaped profoundly by the
   politico-religious crises of the previous century. The article aims to
   stimulate a new analysis of the facts of a tory-Jacobite career, and so
   enhance a debate that is in danger of appearing stale. It aspires to
   reach a deeper understanding of the meaning and principles of
   eighteenth-century, toryism, beyond the mere counting of `Jacobite' or
   `Hanoverian' heads.},

Abstract = {This is essentially a `'now it can be told'' account of a massive fraud
   perpetrated on the Brisbane City Council in the mid-1970s by six
   attendants in a council car park, who manipulated bundy clocks to
   falsify departure times on parking tickets surrendered by departing
   motorists. Because of bitter personal rivalry between two senior council
   officials, which was complicated by (i) strong support for one official
   at elected member level, (ii) the subsequently discovered domestic
   liaison of the latter official with one of the prime suspects, and (iii)
   bungling in the crown prosecutor's office leading to a judge's decision
   to throw out the initial conspiracy charge against the car park
   attendants, it seemed that they might be reinstated and resume stealing
   on a massive scale. A method of dealing effectively with the issue,
   involving `'blowing the whistle'' while protecting the identity of the
   whistleblowers, was therefore devised. As a result, the thieves were
   eventually charged and convicted individually. The senior official who
   advised against police investigation of the suspected fraud while
   concealing his relationship with a prime suspect was also punished. The
   paper concludes with a defence of the deception perpetrated by
   whistleblowers to protect themselves from possible retribution.},

Abstract = {In October 1775 two hoaxes, perpetrated for separate reasons by John
   Wilkes and his friend, the Chevalier d'Eon, briefly collided. Wilkes's
   hoax, the `Sayre plot', was probably intended to provoke a test of the
   constitutionality of the recent `King's Proclamation', which encroached
   Upon the statutory definition of treason. The hoax involved creating the
   impression that a conspiracy, existed to resolve the deepening American
   crisis by overthrowing George III. D'Eon'S hoax involved spreading the
   rumour that he himself was a woman in order to embarrass the French king
   into recalling him from exile on d'Eon's terms, including a generous
   financial pack-age. For Wilkes, although neither George III's overthrow
   nor the modfiication of his colonial policy were likely expectations,
   either result would have been a bonus. And although d'Eon was
   unquestionably a man, he did actually (if inexplicably) desire to be
   perceived as a woman, living the life of an heroic man. Mien d'Eon's
   hoax suddenly progressed too far - trapping him into agreeing to dress
   as a woman, which, at first, he seemed unwilling to do - he delayed
   signing the deal for a month, until he saw that the `Sayre plot' (whose
   success could have strengthened d'Eon's negotiating position) had
   utterly failed.},

Title = {THE ROLE OF NEW DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN A TIME OF CRISIS (Pandemic
   2019-2021)},

Abstract = {The article investigates the role of new digital technologies during a
   crisis period on the example of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
   Considering the methods used by different states to prevent the spread
   of the virus and its consequences, the author analyzes the advantages of
   the impelled rapid digitalization, scrutinizes its negative aspects, and
   discusses perspectives. Although the digital transformation had already
   been taking place before the pandemic actually started (2019), the
   current crisis facilitates the unprecedented digitalization breakthrough
   in all life spheres, which will have delayed consequences. The short-run
   effects are already obvious: deepening of virtual communication;
   advancement of electronic document flow systems and online-services
   (including E-Government, public health service, etc.); virtualization of
   education, culture, sports, leisure activities; transformation of labour
   market towards distance employment, an outburst of electronic commerce
   and services, robot automation in economy; virtualization of political
   life (online-meetings, online-debates, online-summits, etc.), and,
   moreover, a transfer of power struggle and geopolitical struggle itself
   to digital platforms. Greater convenience and effectiveness are the most
   vivid advantages of digital technologies development, which plays the
   key role in crisis periods. Better access of disabled persons and people
   living in geographically remote places to medical aid, education,
   cultural objects, etc. also belongs to important achievements of the
   rapid digitalization. At the same time, there are significant negative
   aspects of this process, both general and specific. The violation of
   democratic rights and freedoms (primarily, of personal data security and
   individual privacy) is unavoidable in the light of the necessary
   ``digital control{''} from the state to contain the spread of infection.
   Private IT companies participating in the process of the virus spread
   control due to their products (mobile applications, Internet platforms,
   etc.) also benefit from access to personal data. Whereas this issue is
   not central in authoritarian regimes like China, it becomes very
   challenging for democratic societies of the West. The digitalization of
   services gives wide room for irregularities and fraud in general. A
   growing ``digital exclusion{''} is another concern: the greater
   dependency on technical means excludes certain parts of the population
   unable to use them for different reasons. An increasing
   individualization and solitude amid the lacking real-life communication
   gives rise to complicated psychological issues and mental disorders.
   Among specific negative side-effects of digitalization there are
   obstacles in personal electronic verification, worsening in the quality
   of remote medical assistance and online-education, unemployment growth
   and smashup of offline-businesses in economy, and some other. The most
   complicated question of the current crisis and the next ``post-COVID{''}
   period is how serious the above-mentioned negative consequences of the
   rapid digitalization will be, to what extent they may devaluate its
   advantages, what sacrifice will be made by humanity to pay for comfort
   and effectiveness.},

Abstract = {At times of crisis, access to information takes on special importance,
   and in the Internet age of constant connectedness, this is truer than
   ever. Over the course of the pandemic, the huge public demand for
   constantly updated health information has been met with a massive
   response from official and scientific sources, as well as from the
   mainstream media. However, it has also generated a vast stream of
   user-generated digital postings. Such phenomena are often regarded as
   unhelpful or even dangerous since they unwittingly spread misinformation
   or make it easier for potentially harmful disinformation to circulate.
   However, little is known about the dynamics of such forums or how
   scientific issues are represented there. To address this knowledge gap,
   this chapter uses a corpus-assisted discourse approach to examine how
   ``expert{''} knowledge and other sources of authority are represented
   and contested in a corpus of 10,880 reader comments responding to Mail
   Online articles on the development of the COVID-19 vaccine in
   February-July 2020. The results show how ``expert{''} knowledge is
   increasingly problematized and politicized, while other strategies are
   used to claim authority. The implications of these findings are
   discussed in the context of sociological theories, and some tentative
   solutions are proposed.},

   interpretive models that make it possible to supplement the knowledge
   existing in Polish and European historiography about the reasons that
   prompted the tsarist government to carry out such a brutal reprisal
   against Polish youth. A valuable source on the history of secret
   societies in the Svisloch Gymnasium, which was not taken into account
   when publishing documents of the investigative case, correspondence of
   participants in student unrest and other ego-documents is introduced
   into scientific circulation. This source, extracted from the Russian
   State Historical Archive (RGIA = RSHA, Fund 1409, Inventory 1, storage
   unit 1300, papers of His Imperial Highness Tsesarevich Konstantin
   Pavlovich), which makes it possible to judge the unrest in Svisloch and
   draw a conclusion about the punishment that the students suffered, was
   ignored by researchers, since chronologically fell into the scope of the
   Filaret and Philomat case, and the rioters were not brought to trial and
   were not among those exiled deep into the empire.},

Abstract = {Antisemitism has once again proven itself to be an international
   phenomenon, crossing borders and cultures with ease and adept at finding
   major issues in the public square, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, upon
   which to hang its claims. This article argues that antisemitism
   currently takes four major forms: Anti-Zionist antisemitism, which
   targets the State of Israel as a Jewish collectivity;
   Neo-Traditionalism, which revives pre-modern anti-Judaic notions in
   contemporary guise; Holocaust relativisation, which involves
   instrumentalizing and distorting the nature of the Holocaust without
   denying it outright; and anti-Judaism, which manifests in efforts to ban
   circumcision, kosher slaughter and other core Jewish rituals. The
   article concludes by examining whether the International Holocaust
   Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) Working Definition of Antisemitism is an
   adequate tool for engaging with a growing problem, suggesting ways in
   which the definition might be amended to make it more effective.},

Abstract = {With the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccination, there was a rise in
   anti-vaccine narratives leading to vaccine hesitancy. Social media
   platforms like Facebook have introduced policies to control the spread
   of these narratives. However, the comments section is frequently
   ignored. A preliminary anti-vaccination codebook was created using
   criteria identified in international literature and completed using the
   comments on the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB)'s Facebook page, which is
   the centre for health education and publicity of health information in
   Sri Lanka. Next, the most commented vaccine-related posts for each
   quarter were extracted from the HPB Facebook page and the comments were
   coded according to the finalised codebook and were analysed. The
   finalised codebook contained a total of 24 codes that were organised
   into six primary categories. A total of 7,316 comments were extracted.
   The comments that were against vaccination constituted 47.3\% of all
   vaccine-related comments. The most commonly occurring code was `health
   hazards'. It was evident that the number of comments against vaccination
   has increased with time. This may indicate that anti-vaccination
   movements are becoming more prevalent in. It is essential to engage in
   extensive social listening in order to forestall the propagation of
   anti-vaccine sentiments and conspiracy theories.},

Abstract = {The risk of contracting COVID-19 was a very specific situation of
   uncertainty and ambi-guity, and of course, cognitively interesting for
   psychologists studying the determinants of behaviors of different
   personality types. In this study, we set our sights on trying to find a
   correlation between adherence to wearing masks and receiving
   vaccinations and having certain character traits that we thought might
   influence preventive behavior or not. We focused on the Dark
   Triad-psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism-as well as social
   approval and the need for cognition closure, as these traits have
   previously been linked to heightened conspiracy mentalities. We
   recruited 159 subjects in the experiment, including 53 male and 106
   female participants over the age of 18 to take part in an online survey
   investigating personality and COVID-19 information. The results
   confirmed our hypothesis that age, empathy, the need for social approval
   and other psychological traits are the factors that differentiates
   people who wear face masks from those who do not. However, it seems
   impossible to define one set of features that would predispose people to
   not wear face masks. In our study, the importance of psychological
   features differed depending on the category of public places. We discuss
   possible implications of these findings and provide direction for future
   research.},

Abstract = {This article examines ideas of sacred space in twentieth-century Spain,
   looking in particular at the phenomenon of church burning. Arson attacks
   on ecclesiastical buildings punctuate Spanish history from the 1909
   Tragic Week to the Civil War. The form of the attack was consistent,
   with the assailants targeting church interiors rather than the building
   itself. This, the article argues, reflected an anticlerical imaginary in
   which confinement, seclusion, and conspiracy featured heavily. But it is
   also the case that churches are hard to burn. During the Civil War of
   1936-39, when Catholic practice was illegal and churches requisitioned,
   often after arson attacks, the question of what to do with them became
   acute. Just as they were hard to burn, so they were often hard to
   repurpose. On occasion the reuse appeared to be symbolic rather than
   practical, despite the claims of rationality and secularization put
   forward in the historiography. A central theme of the article is that
   these buildings have to be understood as material objects that impose
   their own demands on those who interact with them, including those who
   would burn them down. The sacred space they enclose is contained and
   demarcated by their walls, the ``skin{''} of the building, which was
   always the first point of attack.},

Title = {Believing in nothing and believing in everything: The underlying
   cognitive paradox of anti-COVID-19 vaccine attitudes},
Journal = {PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {189},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A major reason why some people oppose the COVID-19 vaccine is the
   influence of misinformation. This study suggests that the cognitive
   paradox of simultaneously believing known facts less and new,
   ``alternative facts{''} more is the outcome of a distrust mindset,
   characterized by spontaneous consideration of alternatives, including
   misinformation. We captured this paradox and its correlates in a scale
   that measures individuals' ability to distinguish between the truth
   value of well-established facts ({''}Earth rotates eastward around its
   own axis, completing a full rotation once in about 24 h{''}) and
   baseless ``alternative facts{''} ({''}Earth can change its rotation
   direction and flip its axis, and we will never notice it{''}). Assuming
   that an anti-COVID-19 vaccine attitude arises from a chronically
   distrusting mindset, we sampled participants on Prolific who were
   pre-screened for their COVID-19 vaccine attitude based on earlier
   responses. We found that people who rejected COVID-19 vaccines believed
   well-established facts less, and ``alternative facts{''} more, compared
   to supporters of the vaccine. Less discernment between truths and
   falsehoods was correlated with less intellectual humility, more distrust
   and greater reliance on one's intuition. This observed thought pattern
   offers insights into theoretical understanding of the antecedents of
   belief in ``alternative facts{''} and conspiracy theories.},

Title = {Combating Fake News: Stakeholder Interventions and Potential Solutions},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {78268-78289},
Abstract = {The fake news ``infodemic{''}, facilitated by social media and mobile
   message sharing platforms, has progressed from causing a nuisance to
   seriously impacting law and order through deliberate and large-scale
   manipulation of public sentiments. There are social, religious,
   political, and economic dimensions to the fake news phenomenon,
   providing enough motivation for interested parties to push biased
   opinions, claims, conspiracies and fraud to many naive information
   consumers. The ease with which fake news can be created and propagated
   makes it extremely challenging to detect and mitigate. To combat the
   fake news, the researchers have utilized mechanisms which are largely
   based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and social network
   analysis. However, no viable solution has yet been deployed at a scale.
   This paper present a comprehensive survey on combating fake news and
   evaluates the challenges involved in its detection with the help of
   existing detection mechanisms and techniques to control its spread. The
   challenges associated with combating fake news have been addressed based
   on the various aspects such as psychological, economic, and technical.
   Furthermore, we consider the fake news combat spectrum to analyze the
   stakeholder interventions due to the spread of fake news. Finally,
   various technology-based solutions have been presented for combating
   fake news and the associated future challenges and opportunities.},

Abstract = {Mieville's short story stands out for its perhaps experimental, perhaps
   old-fashioned form: the story's first-person narrator adopts, in
   nineteenth-century fashion, the persona of an editor and presents both
   his own view on the `events' in question and a number of mock documents
   he has allegedly been sent. Readers are encouraged to piece together the
   story elements - events and characters - from postcards, minutes of a
   meeting, memos, personal letters, and tables. Typographically distinct
   and juxtaposed rather than narratively linked, these text fragments
   suggest internal conflicts in a group of people who track rogue streets
   - streets that change their location spontaneously and wreak havoc on
   the geographical and the political order of cities. It is no coincidence
   that a mix-up of names and addresses is the starting point of the story;
   the story's ending hints at the consequences of having or not having a
   fixed address. My contribution examines Mieville's use of the short
   story form in the context of fantastic literature. Following suggestions
   of Mieville's ``The Conspiracy of Architecture{''} (1998), the
   foregrounding of formal and quasi-material aspects of organising and
   mediating knowledge is read as an engagement with the power/knowledge
   dispositives made up of discursive ordering principles as well as city
   planning and city geography.},

   I},
Journal = {BYLYE GODY},

Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {77-87},
Abstract = {This article discusses one of the aspects of the ethno-confessional
   policy of the Russian autocracy, namely the process of incorporating the
   Kingdom of Poland into the Russian Empire. The historiographical review
   shows the main vector of the genesis of Russian historiography on this
   issue: from the pre-revolutionary period, there is an opinion about the
   Polish Constitution as one of the projects in the series of
   constitutional intentions of Emperor Alexander I. The article attempts
   to propose a different interpretation of this phenomenon. The importance
   of the press and public opinion in the political life of Europe in the
   period after the Napoleonic Wars is noted. It is shown that Alexander I
   after the Vienna Congress was at the zenith of fame, and hence his next
   steps on the Polish question are explained by the desire to continue to
   maintain the status of the European monarch on the Russian throne. At
   the same time, the emperor's famous Warsaw speech was received very
   coolly by publicists. At the same time, a series of events begins in
   Europe, and the articulations of Russian diplomats actualize the chimera
   of the threat to the monarchies from the global conspiracy of secret
   societies - it was this myth that led to the curtailment of the
   emperor's liberal undertakings.},

Abstract = {Gray considers the determinants of British policy towards emigration
   (and particularly towards state-assisted `colonization') from Ireland
   during the Great Famine of 1845-50. He surveys the idea of
   `colonization' as advocated by Charles Buller in 1843, and its varying
   appeal (changing over time) in Ireland, Britain and the settlement
   colonies of the British empire. He also considers the issue in the light
   of pro- and anti-Malthusian interpretations of Irish population
   pressure, and the emergence of the alternative idea of `internal
   colonization'. Gray argues that the failure of the state to adopt an
   emigration policy in 1846-50 as part of its response to the Famine was
   the consequence of a combination of anti-Irish prejudice in Britain and
   the colonies (which was sharpened by the arrival of large numbers of
   economic refugees in 1847 and the political conspiracies of 1848), and
   the prevalence of an economic doctrine that prioritized the need for
   Irish self-help and moral transformation over state assistance. He
   traces the debate over colonization within the Whig government headed by
   Lord John Russell, and concludes that some form of assisted emigration
   was a feasible policy measure, and that its rejection had adverse
   consequences in terms of additional famine mortality.},

Abstract = {The problem of public and private is often thought to be a boundary
   problem. `Public' and `private' are said to denote separate areas of
   human endeavour - distinct `realms', `spheres',. or `spaces'. The task
   of formulating clear boundaries, however, has proven to be enormously
   complex. It seems that every attempt at conceptualizing a purely private
   area of activity runs into a particular kind of difficulty, namely, many
   of the activities characteristic of the private sphere turn out to be
   activities toward which no responsible public authority could possibly
   remain indifferent: abuse within the family, collusion in the business
   world, criminal conspiracy among friends.
   It may be, however, that the problem of public and private, conceived as
   a boundary problem, is thereby misconceived. It would perhaps be better
   to think of public and private as denoting not primarily - perhaps not
   at all - separate realms of endeavour but different ways of being in the
   world, different `manners of acting'. To act ina private manner is
   simply different in character from acting in a public manner. Such a
   formulation, if pursued with care; would allow us to accept fully the
   arguments of those who would question the very idea of a private realm,
   while still permitting us to retain a vigorous and compelling
   public/private distinction.},

Title = {Early-warning of generator collusion in Chinese electricity market based
   on Information Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {221},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The collusion of Generating Companies (GenCos) in the domestic power
   spot market not only damage the fairness of the market, but also
   seriously affect the healthy development of GenCos. Aiming at the
   problem of low real-time performance of the current identification
   methods of collusion behaviors of GenCos, this paper com-bines the
   collusion index system and the unsupervised Information Deep
   Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (Info-DAGMM) to realize intelligent
   real-time early-warning of collusion of GenCos in the market. Firstly, a
   comprehensive collusion indicator system for GenCos is constructed and
   the Info-DAGMM is proposed based on the data characteristics of
   imbalanced positive and negative samples. Secondly, the mutual
   information of original input and latent variable is added to the loss
   function, so that the expression network can obtain a more discernible
   low-dimensional space, which is conducive to the work of the estimator
   GMM. Finally, a new evaluation index, Collusion Suspicion Index (CSI),
   is proposed to identify GenCos in which conspiracy occurs. Case study
   shows that, compared with traditional anomaly detection methods, the
   Info-DAGMM network pro-posed in this paper is more suitable for
   electricity market data and can provide early-warning of collusion for
   GenCos precisely and quickly, with an accuracy rate of more than 80\%.},

Title = {Pandemic paranoia in the general population: international prevalence

Abstract = {Background. The term `pandemic paranoia' has been coined to refer to
   heightened levels of mistrust and suspicion towards other people
   specifically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we examine the
   international prevalence of pandemic paranoia in the general population
   and its associated sociodemographic profile.
   Methods. A representative international sample of general population
   adults (N=2510) from five sites (USA N= 535, Germany N= 516, UK N= 512,
   Australia N= 502 and Hong Kong N=445) were recruited using stratified
   quota sampling (for age, sex, educational attainment) and completed the
   Pandemic Paranoia Scale (PPS).
   Results. The overall prevalence rate of pandemic paranoia was 19\%, and
   was highest in Australia and lowest in Germany. On the subscales of the
   PPS, prevalence was 11\% for persecutory threat, 29\% for paranoid
   conspiracy and 37\% for interpersonal mistrust. Site and general
   paranoia significantly predicted pandemic paranoia. Sociodemographic
   variables (lower age, higher population size and income, being male,
   employed and no migrant status) explained additional variance and
   significantly improved prediction of pandemic paranoia.
   Conclusions. Pandemic paranoia was relatively common in a representative
   sample of the general population across five international sites.
   Sociodemographic variables explained a small but significant amount of
   the variance in pandemic paranoia.},

Abstract = {One diagnosis of Bell's theorem is that its premise of Outcome
   Independence is unreasonably strong, as it postulates one common
   screener system that purports to explain all the correlations involved.
   This poses a challenge of constructing a model for quantum correlations
   that is local, non-conspiratorial, and has many separate screener
   systems rather than one common screener system. In particular, the
   assumptions of such models should not entail Bell's inequalities.
   Although we stop short of proving that such models exist (or do not
   exist), we obtain a few results relating them to models with a common
   screener system. We prove that if such a model exists, then there exists
   a local common screener system model for quantum correlations breaking
   Bell's inequalities; that model, however, can be conspirational. We also
   show a way of transforming a model with separate screener systems for
   the Bell-Aspect correlations that satisfies strong Parameter
   Independence (PI) and No-Conspiracy (NOCONS) into a somewhat different
   model for the same correlations in which strong PI is somewhat
   compromised, but NOCONS and ``regular{''} PI hold, and the elements of
   the constructed partition act deterministically with respect to
   measurement results. This means that such models allow the derivation of
   the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequalities.},

Title = {Mass violence in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder and
   Narcissistic Personality Disorder: A case analysis of Anders Breivik
   using the ``Path to Intended and Terroristic Violence{''} model},
Journal = {AGGRESSION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {229-236},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Objective: There exist significant gaps in our understanding and
   knowledge of the contributory factors which give rise to the development
   of a mass shooter.
   Method: A case analysis is presented of Anders Behring Breivik who
   engaged in a bombing and shooting spree in Norway on July 22, 2011.
   Results: The case analysis presents that he has diagnoses of Asperger's
   Syndrome, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and Antisocial Personality
   Traits/Disorder. Additionally, a forensic profile is presented that a
   narcissistic de compensation contributed to him developing a depression,
   followed by a rewrite of his life story where he is a hero defending
   Europe against a conspiracy. However his personal and political
   grievances and violent ideation placed him onto the Path to
   Intended/Terroristic Violence, which culminated in the attacks in
   Norway.
   Conclusions: The present study suggests that there may be an association
   between NPD and violence, similar to other studies. However, the factor
   of narcissistic decompensation (possibly co-occurring with an Asperger's
   coping strategy) was presented as a critical component of NPD that
   mediated its relationship with violence. Furthermore, aspects from his
   Asperger's Syndrome and Narcissistic Decompensation contributed to his
   personal and political grievances and the other steps on the Path
   towards Intended/Terroristic Violence. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The concept of the internal enemy as ``the ally of the international
   communist conspiracy{''} in Latin America is addressed in this article
   as the systematic application of a series of measures drawn from the
   Truman Doctrine and, at its core, the inevitable paradox of the
   universal war of good vs. evil, communism vs. capitalism, civilization
   vs. barbarism, in the language of the post-Cold War and the polarity of
   the nations of the Southern Cone and Mesoamerica, considered by the
   United States to be in need of the protection and safeguarding of the
   imperial eagle nation. Within this context, we analyze how intelligence
   agencies such as the Administrative Department of Security (DAS) and the
   Secretariat of Intelligence of the Province of Buenos Aires (DIPBA) were
   implemented in Colombia and Argentina, respectively, giving rise to
   political persecution, human rights violations, and the deterioration of
   the living conditions of the people, who were assaulted, persecuted and
   assassinated for opposing the governments of the time. Likewise, the
   article harshly criticizes the School of the Americas for its systematic
   implementation of counter-guerrilla tactics and strategies, which, far
   from alleviating damages or socializing the civil population, has left a
   trail of systematic human rights violations throughout the decades.},

Abstract = {On 2 November 1938 one of General Franco's warships shelled and sank a
   Spanish merchant ship nine miles from the east coast of England. The
   captain and his family were rescued by the local lifeboat and the human
   story, as well as the proximity of the incident to the coast of Great
   Britain, aroused considerable public interest there. Although not in
   itself a particularly momentous occurrence in such a destructive war,
   the sequence of events leading up to the convergence of the two ships on
   a distant coastline does cast some light on a most neglected aspect of
   that war-the struggle between the opposing navies to impede the
   transport of essential supplies to the enemy's ports. It also has
   ramifications involving naval intelligence, maritime law and the
   international tensions affecting seafaring nations during the conflict.
   The political fallout in the UK hinged on the debate as to whether the
   episode constituted an act of piracy. The subsequent fates of the
   captain and crew of the sunken ship reflect the ethos of the times. The
   encounter is most unlikely to have been random and although conspiracy
   theories are extremely attractive and there is no shortage of
   candidates, it is unlikely that the identity of the conspirators will
   ever be known.},

Title = {Political and Social Drivers of COVID-19 Prevention and Climate Change
   Behaviors and Attitudes},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Attitudes and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate
   change crisis might be driven by similar political beliefs and
   attitudes. The current study used a neo-Gramsci perspective to examine
   how political attitudes may be linked to COVID-19 prevention and climate
   change attitudes and behaviors. A longitudinal online survey in the US
   assessed climate change and COVID-19 attitudes and behaviors, and wave 7
   (2021) data were used to predict outcomes at wave 8 (2022) among 572
   respondents. There were significant correlations among the variables of
   political ideology, climate change concerns, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy,
   COVID-19 skepticism, COVID-19 vaccine as a personal choice, COVID-19
   conspiracy, political correctness, percent of Republican friends, and
   dislike of the Democratic Party. In the multivariate models, COVID-19
   vaccination as a personal choice was significantly associated with the
   four outcomes: vaccination status, climate change actions, vaccine
   hesitancy, and climate change concerns. COVID-19 skepticism was
   significantly associated with vaccination status, vaccine hesitancy, and
   climate change concerns. These findings suggest that there are similar
   drivers of COVID-19 prevention and climate change attitudes and
   behaviors, and interventions need to be tailored to target
   individual-level and societal-level factors.},

   America},
Journal = {CUADERNOS INFO},
Year = {2022},
Number = {52},
Pages = {24-46},
Abstract = {This paper aims to understand the formal characteristics, the spaces of
   dissemination and the anti-science narratives related to COVID-19 and
   their engagement in Ibero -America. This type of disinformation has
   hardly been specifically investigated in this context; the research has
   been more focused on the study of fake news about this crisis from more
   general perspectives. A total of 238 fake contents were analyzed in two
   phases: a study of all verified fake contents spread in 2020 in this
   region and an analysis of the most propagated tweets included in the
   hashtag \#plandemia. Quantitative results were analyzed with descriptive
   and inferential statistical procedures using chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis,
   U-Mann-Whitney tests, correlational studies, and linear regression. This
   research advances some of the patterns of scientific disinformation,
   which may be useful for future health crises: the high prevalence of
   fabricated content, the relevance of visual elements (although they are
   not predictors of engagement in this type ofnarrative), and the growing
   importance of instant messaging services as propagation spaces. It also
   discusses the remarkable role of fact-checkers against disinformation.
   These entities are proving to be effective in dismantling the denialist
   and conspiracy narratives circulating about the disease and to achieve a
   more effective communication of science.},

Abstract = {In our research with young Bangladeshis, we have been repeatedly struck
   by the popularity of television, DVD and Internet material that offers a
   modernist, quasi-scientific defence of Islamic knowledge against both
   `western' scientific criticisms and US fundamentalist Christians. The
   South Indian doctor Zakir Naik's programmes, broadcast on his own
   television channel (Peace TV) and also available widely on DVD, are very
   popular, and admired for their `logical' and apparently even-handed
   approach. His Islamic Research Foundation propagates his and similar
   material on the Web. The Turkish scholar `Harun Yahya' (Adnan Oktar)'s
   diatribes against Darwinism and other western scientific evils are
   widely available on the Internet as text, audio and video, and often
   referred to. Full-on conspiracy theory material such as `The Arrivals'
   series of online videos also finds a ready audience. We ask why these
   apparently implausible attacks on western knowledge carry conviction
   among young Muslims, many of them students studying for western-style
   university degrees in Bangladesh or the United Kingdom. We also ask to
   what degree the views of men such as Naik and Yahya might provide the
   basis of an alternative modernity, and what the implications of their
   wide popularity might be in the political arena.},

Title = {COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among university students in Lebanon},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {149},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Little is known about the decision-making process of college students in
   Lebanon regarding coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. The
   aim of this study was to identify factors predicting behavioural
   intentions of students enrolled at the American University of Beirut to
   obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 3805 students were randomly
   selected. Participants were divided into three groups: vaccine accepting
   (willing to take or already took the vaccine), vaccine hesitant
   (hesitant to take the vaccine) and vaccine resistant (decided not to
   take the vaccine). Overall, participants were vaccine accepting (87\%),
   with 10\% and 3\% being hesitant and resistant, respectively. Vaccine
   hesitancy was significantly associated with nationality, residency
   status and university rank. Participants who believed the vaccine was
   safe and in agreement with their personal views were less likely to be
   hesitant. Participants who did not receive the flu vaccine were more
   hesitant than those who did. Moreover, a significant association between
   hesitancy and agreement with conspiracies was observed. A high level of
   knowledge about COVID-19 disease and vaccine resulted in lower odds of
   vaccine resistance among students. The factors identified explaining
   each of the three vaccine intention groups can be used as core content
   for health communication and social marketing campaigns to increase the
   rate of COVID-19 vaccination.},

Abstract = {Our approach to the epistemology of post-truth is based on the idea that
   to fully comprehend any post-truth, going back to its origins (i.e., to
   the moment in which some faulty interpretations start to spread) can be
   not only relevant but illuminating. One of the most renowned cases of
   post-truth concerns vaccines and their alleged relationship with autism.
   It all started in 1998, when The Lancet published a study suggesting a
   link between the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and some symptoms
   of autism. The case is relevant both because it is at the origins of
   contemporary anti-vaccinism and because it took twelve years to fully
   disprove what in 1998 was presented as a scientific truth: this means
   that the boundary between truth and falsehood has been blurred for a
   long period of time. For this purpose, we have applied the semiotic
   methodology to 20 articles from The Independent, 20 from The Telegraph,
   20 from The Guardian, and 20 from The Daily Mail, published between 1998
   and 2010. Unexpectedly, many elements that can be seen as `post-truth
   seeds', such as conspiracy theories and the joint presentation of
   multiple truths, have been found even in the most scientifically
   accurate newspapers.},

   among College Students in Italy},

Abstract = {Vaccine hesitancy (VH) may be significant in jeopardizing efforts to
   mass containment of COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was carried out
   on a sample of 2667 Italian college students, before the COVID-19
   vaccines became available for this age group (from 7 May to 31 May
   2021). An online survey was created to obtain information about
   socio-demographic, health-related, and psychological factors linked to
   mRNA and viral vector COVID-19 vaccines. Statistically significant
   higher VH (30.4\%) and vaccine resistance (12.2\%) rates were found for
   viral vector than mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (7.2\% and 1.0\%, respectively;
   p < 0.001). Factors related to viral vector VH were partially different
   from those related to mRNA VH. Students with greater endorsement on
   conspiracy statements and negative attitudes toward the vaccine had
   higher odds of being vaccine-hesitant or -resistant. Students who had
   received a previous COVID-19 test and who scored higher on the
   agreeableness personality dimension had lower odds to be
   vaccine-hesitant or -resistant. The willingness to choose the vaccine
   was related to the viral vector but not to the mRNA VH. Taking into
   consideration the factors involved in vaccine hesitancy/resistance in
   college students could represent a key public health strategy to
   increase vaccine coverage and reduce viral spreading.},

Abstract = {The more than a million, mostly Muslim, arrivals in the European Union
   in recent years have given mainstream politicians an opportunity to
   generate and exploit the public racist, xenophobic and ultra-nationalist
   urges of the sort that had previously been the exclusive preserve of the
   extreme right. This successful vote-getting strategy hingeS on
   disassociating ethno-religious hatred, which Islamophobia is, from its
   most stigmatized example in Europe: antisemitism. Nowhere has this
   process been clearer than in Hungary, infamous for `solving' the
   migration crisis by erecting a wire fence along its borders. Viktor
   Orban and his ruling Fidesz party have stolen the racist thunder of the
   far-right Jobbik party, but without the latter's once open antisemitism.
   Jobbik has responded by also seemingly renouncing antisemitism, ignoring
   the protests of its more die-hard neo-Nazi supporters. Kalmar's article
   focuses on the government's use of a conspiracy theory about the Jewish
   financier George Soros as an example of exploiting antisemitism while
   claiming to oppose it. It suggests that the process of rejecting
   antisemitism, if disingenuously, in order to legitimize Islamophobic
   racism in Hungary is a useful model for examining similar processes in
   much of the Euro-Atlantic world.},

Title = {Securing justice? The Australian campaign to save the Rosenbergs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIAN STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-17},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they executed the Rosenbergs,
   recalled Sylvia Plath in The Bell Jar. Others recalled this event
   differently: as legal murder and a flagrant miscarriage of justice. The
   electrocution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg in June 1953, on a charge of
   conspiracy to commit espionage, was unprecedented in the history of the
   United States and aroused international outrage. Although there are
   scattered studies of the worldwide protest movement, none has examined
   the Australian dimension. This paper, therefore, fills a
   historiographical gap by exploring the genesis, development, and
   activities of the Australian campaign to pressure the Truman and
   Eisenhower administrations to grant clemency to the Rosenbergs. That
   campaign faced several obstacles: one was the liaison and intelligence
   sharing between the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO)
   and US Consular and Embassy officials in Sydney and Canberra and another
   was the infiltration of its leadership by an important ASIO operative.
   Drawing on the extensive papers of the New York-based Committee to
   Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case, the article will illuminate the
   close transnational connection between the Australian and American
   campaigns and challenge the customary characterisation of the Rosenberg
   clemency committees as fronts for the Communist Party or products of
   Moscow's machinations.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how local and transnational developments converged
   in 1857 to transform European attitudes towards Indian inhabitants in
   Singapore. Recognized in preceding years as useful to the security and
   the development of the colony, by late 1857, Indians in Singapore had
   come to be viewed by Europeans as a `menace'. That change in disposition
   was largely the product of factors extraneous to the actions of the
   local Indian inhabitants themselves. Besieged by news of multiple
   challenges to the British Empire, European nerves were rattled by
   perceived threats emanating from sections of the Asian populace in
   Singapore. In early 1857, a dispute between Tamil-Muslims and Europeans
   brought to the fore the latter's anxieties and prejudices. That episode
   was followed, in May, by news of the massive rebellion of native troops
   in India. The emerging distrust for Indians was exacerbated by public
   rumours and fanned by editorials and reports published in the local
   press. Perceptions of immediate danger from the colony of transported
   convicts, and the fear of an Indian conspiracy during Muharram, sparked
   a panic that would have ramifications on the position of Indians in
   Singapore and leave an imprint on the long term political development of
   the Straits Settlements.(1)},

Abstract = {In early 20th-century Damascus, a group of religious scholars who called
   themselves mutadayyinun (the ``very pious{''}) and who claimed to
   represent an Islamic ``orthodoxy{''} launched a journal, al-Haqa'iq, to
   expose the crimes of the mutafarnijun (the ``overly Frankified{''}) and
   to agitate for a return to ``true Islam{''}. According to the
   mutadayyinun, the mutafarnijun were introducing into the Ottoman Empire
   practices borrowed from the West and were thus abetting a Western
   conspiracy against the empire and Islam. Among the practices the
   mutadayyinun found particularly irksome were those that threatened
   ``traditional{''} and ``scripturally-dictated{''} customs relating to
   gender, such as veiling and the seclusion of women. What becomes clear
   through an analysis of the debate, the reasons for its prominence on the
   pages of al-Haqa'iq, and the method and style of argumentation adopted
   by the mutadayyinun, however, is that despite their claim to be the
   upholders of tradition, the mutadayyinun relied on the same epistemic
   assumptions as those they castigated. Thus, unbeknownst to them, they
   were engaged in the process of inventing a religio-political synthesis
   coherent with contemporary social and political structures and
   institutions. The traces of this religio-political synthesis, later
   adopted or reinvented by others, remains embedded within the structures
   and institutions of the contemporary Syrian state.},

Abstract = {AIDS was first diagnosed in Nigeria in 1986. By that time, the
   government had enough information from experiences in other African
   countries to goad it into quickly establishing a control program.
   Nigeria's National AIDS Control program, however, fell victim to years
   of military arbitrariness and uncertainty. It was underfunded and had
   three directors in as many years. This arbitrariness and general
   lukewarm response from government occurred despite rapid increases in
   seroprevalence rates. Available data indicate a national prevalence of
   5.4 percent and rates as high as 30 percent among some ``high-risk{''}
   groups; as many as 10 to 15 persons with full-blown AIDS are admitted
   weekly in some tertiary facilities. Experiences in communities show an
   already heavy and growing burden. The nonchalance of past military
   regimes is gradually being reversed with Nigeria's return to civil rule
   in May 1999. Perhaps because of the fragmented statistics and the
   government's seeming conspiracy of silence, Nigeria is not included in
   the count of African countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence. The author
   suggests that the new democratic government needs to go beyond professed
   commitment to demonstrable action to halt the spread and address social
   and other impacts of the epidemic.},

Title = {Off-label drug use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa: topic
   modelling and sentiment analysis of ivermectin in South Africa and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},

Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Although rejected by the World Health Organization, the human and even
   veterinary formulation of ivermectin has widely been used for prevention
   and treatment of COVID-19. In this work we leverage Twitter to
   understand the reasons for the drug use from ivermectin supporters,
   their source of information, their emotions, their gender demographics,
   and location information, in Nigeria and South Africa. Topic modelling
   is performed on a Twitter dataset gathered using keywords `ivermectin'
   and `ivm'. A model is fine-tuned on RoBERTa to find the stance of the
   tweets. Statistical analysis is performed to compare the stance and
   emotions. Most ivermectin supporters either redistribute conspiracy
   theories posted by influencers, or refer to flawed studies confirming
   ivermectin efficacy in vitro. Three emotions have the highest intensity,
   optimism, joy and disgust. The number of anti-ivermectin tweets has a
   significant positive correlation with vaccination rate. All the
   provinces in South Africa and most of the provinces of Nigeria are
   pro-ivermectin and have higher disgust polarity. This work makes the
   effort to understand public discussions regarding ivermectin during the
   COVID-19 pandemic to help policy-makers understand the rationale behind
   its popularity, and inform more targeted policies to discourage
   self-administration of ivermectin. Moreover, it is a lesson to future
   outbreaks.},

Title = {Polarization \& populist backlash in transitioning Tunisia: the role of
   internet media \& media ownership},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 5},
Abstract = {Since it's revolution, Tunisia's road to democracy has been
   turbulent-with apathy, polarization, and politically motivated violence
   stifling its transition. While much has been made of internet media's
   role during Tunisia's revolution, far fewer studies have examined its
   continuing effects throughout the country's ongoing democratic
   transition. This study draws on original interviews conducted with
   politicians, journalists, and democracy activists immediately following
   Tunisia's 2019 presidential elections to highlight how internet media
   and media ownership have hindered democratic consolidation. Since its
   revolution, internet media has stood as a central pillar of Tunisia's
   political discourse-but despite the country's many subsequent gains in
   informational freedom and media pluralism, I find that concentrated
   ownership and weak regulation over the internet/media have created space
   for powerful elites, former regime officials, and other anti-democratic
   forces to marshal influence over the online marketplace to stifle and
   push back against democratic consolidation. Overall, concentrated media
   markets-especially online-have empowered elite owners to impede media
   regulation and disseminate an unchecked deluge of bias, misinformation,
   conspiracies, and extremism-thereby propelling the kinds of deepening
   divisions, polarization, and mistrust towards the democratic process
   that has given rise to more populist/authoritarian actors seeking to
   erode democratic institutions and seize political power.},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, different conspiracies have risen, with
   the most dangerous being those focusing on vaccines. Today, there exists
   a social media movement focused on destroying the credibility of
   vaccines and trying to convince people to ignore the advice of
   governments and health organizations on vaccination. Our aim was to
   analyze a COVID-19 antivaccination message campaign on Twitter that uses
   Spanish as the main language, to find the key elements in their
   communication strategy. Twitter data were retrieved from 14 to 28
   December using NodeXL software. We analyzed tweets in Spanish, focusing
   on influential users, most influential tweets, and content analysis of
   tweets. The results revealed ordinary citizens who `offer the truth' as
   the most important profile in this network. The content analysis showed
   antivaccine tweets (31.05\%) as the most frequent. The analysis of
   anti-COVID19 tweets showed that attacks against vaccine safety were the
   most important (79.87\%) but we detected a new kind of message
   presenting the vaccine as a means of manipulating the human genetic code
   (8.1\%). We concluded that the antivaccine movement and its tenets have
   great influence in the COVID-19 negationist movement. We observed a new
   topic in COVID-19 vaccine hoaxes that must be considered in our fight
   against misinformation.},

Abstract = {The post-apartheid period has been marked by a dual relation to memory.
   On the one hand, the process of reconciliation, nation-building and
   abolition of the colour line has engaged a definitive rupture with the
   past. On the other hand, a form of resentment expresses a more
   ambivalent and painful acknowledgement that the past is still deeply
   present through racism, inequalities and prejudices. The AIDS crisis
   both as an objective the rapid spread of the infection - and subjective
   phenomenon - the apprehension of the epidemic through controversies -
   has revealed this duality. Using Thabo Mbeki's statements on the
   infection, but also on race relations and national commemorations, I try
   to analyse beyond the obvious paranoid style a politics of memory which
   unveils hidden truths. The embodiment of the past thus recovered
   involves both the historical condition, that is the inscription of
   social structures in bodies and lives, and the experience of history,
   understood as the elaboration of representations, discourses and
   narratives accounting for the course of events. Considered in this
   light, conspiracy theories become not so much fantasies as factual
   realities, including genocidal projects under apartheid. The recognition
   of this unfinished business of time is a necessary step in the
   construction of a common future.},

Abstract = {This article explores the controversy surrounding the censorship of the
   drama-documentary The War Game in 1965, drawing extensively upon primary
   source material held by the BBC Written Archives Centre and the National
   Archives. Conceived, written and directed by the young documentary
   filmmaker Peter Watkins, The War Game depicted the aftermath of an
   imagined nuclear strike on southern England. The BBC commissioned the
   film only with certain reservations and from the outset made no
   guarantee that the film would be broadcast on television. After much
   deliberation, and consultation with senior government officials
   including Cabinet Secretary Sir Burke Trend, the BBC declined to
   broadcast The War Game on the grounds that it was `too horrifying for
   the medium of broadcasting'. Responsibility for the decision lay with
   the BBC's Chairman of Governors Lord Normanbrook, supported by the
   Director-General Sir Hugh Greene. The film was, however, given a limited
   theatrical release in cinemas. The article concludes that the decision
   not to broadcast The War Game, far from being a conspiracy to keep the
   `truth' of nuclear warfare from the British public, as Watkins
   maintained, was instead the result of a range of institutional and
   cultural factors that caused the BBC to act as it did.},

Title = {Siren calls of anti-government extremism: Far-right influences on the
   German anti-vax ('Querdenken') protest milieu through music},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 10},
Abstract = {The German anti-vax milieu broadly referred to as `Querdenken' or
   `Corona-denier' milieu has grown rapidly since the beginning of the
   COVID-19 pandemic and radicalized in parts to a level of open calls for
   as well as use of violence and anti-government extremism. This has led
   the German authorities to designate this specific environment as a new
   form of extremism called `delegitimization of the state with relevance
   for the protection of the constitution' (Verfassungsschutzrelevante
   Delegitimierung des Staates) in April 2021. Beyond personal and
   organizational links, far-right actors attempted to influence the
   emerging protest milieu from the beginning of its emergence in early
   2020 through subcultural products specifically designed to appeal to
   that milieu, most notably pieces of music focusing on the pandemic and
   stirring up anti-government hatred as well as conspiracy theories. This
   article explores the ideological narrative tropes, antagonists, and
   rhetorical strategies of eight far-right songs supposedly designed to
   target this milieu. The analysis shows how strategic adaption of usually
   openly far-right musicians reflects in the song lyrics. A key finding is
   that the far right uses a combination of personally empowering lyrics on
   the one hand, and open calls for action, resistance, and revolution
   against the government or specific individuals on the other.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Spanish general Domingo Dulce y Garay's
   (1808-1869) participation in the preparations for the military coup of
   September 1868 that put an end to Elizabeth II's reign. Using both
   primary and secondary sources-with particular attention to contemporary
   records- Dulce y Garay's actions during the negotiations with democrats
   and progressists until the triumph of the Revolution a year later will
   be reconstructed. The Rioja official's biography allows us to raise
   other questions of a more general nature about the role of the Union
   Liberal in the debate on Isabella II's replacement, the organization and
   leadership of the party after Leopoldo O'Donnell's death or the funding
   of the conspiracy. After an initial reflection on biographies as a tool
   for historical research and a discussion of the relevance of Dulce y
   Garay's figure, a brief chronology of his activity up to 1866 will be
   elaborated. Then, the main focus of this work, that is, the influence of
   his individual decisions on the historical course of events regarding
   the final stage of Isabella II's period, will be addressed. This paper's
   methodology is analogous to that of Biographical History, in this
   instance used as a tool for a larger-scale analysis of Political
   History.},

   in Indonesia: A Phenomenological Study},

Abstract = {Background: The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   has caused many fatalities in Indonesia. This condition has triggered
   social changes that were never imagined before. There is no research
   that explores the public's perception of the sociological situation.
   Purpose: To sociologically explore community perceptions of the COVID-19
   pandemic situation in Indonesia
   Methods: Purposive sampling, one-on-one, in-depth with semi-structural
   interviews were conducted to collect data. Data saturation was achieved
   after interviewing ten participants. Narratives were analysed by
   Colaizzi's (1978) seven-step method.
   Results: Six themes identified to illustrate sociologically community
   perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in Indonesia were: 1.
   COVID-19 is very dangerous; 2. Threats to the social life sector; 3.
   Threats to the economic sector; 4. Threats to the education sector; 5.
   Global conspiracy; 6. Creating a new work area.
   Conclusion: This pandemic condition has changed many things in the
   social order of society and has a direct impact on various sectors such
   as education and the economy. Information about the impact of social
   phenomena that occur on society during a pandemic will be valuable
   information for government to determine appropriate policies about
   COVID-19 in Indonesia.},

Abstract = {Purpose The paper discusses the predictors of trust in the institutions
   and people involved in crisis management at the beginning of the
   COVID-19 pandemic in Romania. Trust in institutions might be a key
   factor in the way countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic deal with
   the crisis as people might be more willing to accept the restrictions
   and rules imposed if they trust the key institutions and people involved
   in managing the pandemic. The paper provides recommendations for key
   stakeholders to increase trust in people and institutions in times of
   crisis. Design/methodology/approach The authors draw evidence from a
   national online panel survey (N = 1,160) to investigate the main
   predictors of trust in this context. Findings The main results indicate
   that trust in institutions is positively correlated with news
   consumption and personal discussions about the pandemic, perceived
   incidence of COVID-19 fake news, belief in conspiracy theories and
   uncertainty about the future of the country. Originality/value To the
   best of the knowledge, this study is one of the few papers investigating
   the predictors of trust in the institutions and people involved in
   managing the current pandemic in a country in the Central and Eastern
   European region.},

Abstract = {This article considers the link between the increasingly important role
   of automated information curation online and the rise of what we call
   `commercial populism'. We invoke the term to refer to the convergence of
   populism as a marketing tool - a way of selling, for example,
   nutritional supplements or survivalist merchandise - with political
   strategies that cater to the citizen as consumer (whose freedoms are
   framed in the individual register of personal taste unfettered from
   civic concerns or constraints). Perhaps unsurprisingly in this context,
   we draw on the example of Donald Trump's political rise, which while not
   unrelated to his particular idiosyncrasies, demonstrates how the
   automated curation of social media aligns itself with what the
   aggressive rise of commercial populism. The goal of such an analysis is
   to consider how the combination of hyper-commercialism with the formal
   attributes of social media contributes to inter-related political
   pathologies of polarization and conspiracy theory. The consumer-oriented
   model of personal taste catered to by algorithmic curation highlights
   the paradox of `social' media: they promise to enhance the social by
   displacing or reframing it fundamental a-social. The offloading of
   social decisions and formation onto commercial, automated systems for
   curating news and information reinforces this version of individualism,
   contributing to the forms of misrecognition that enable it.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {This paper considers the potential harm inflicted by the COVID-19
   Pandemic on levels of social cohesion in rural communities by analyzing
   ``Letters to the Editors{''} published in five rural community
   newspapers over a 13-month period across Western Canada. Utilizing a
   quantitative ``Content Analysis,{''} combined with a qualitative
   ``Critical Discourse Analysis,{''} this study provides evidence that
   citizens in these communities were divided, almost equally, on the
   necessity of public health measures designed to slow the spread of
   COVID-19 in their communities; that misinformation and conspiracy
   theories related to COVID-19 were present in these communities, although
   at relatively low levels; and most importantly, the nature and form of
   some of the arguments expressed in Letters to the Editor across these
   communities over the necessity of public health measures do speak to
   some potentially explosive areas of disagreement that may lead to
   increasing levels of social discord going forward. Overall, there is
   reason to fear that, aside from the more obvious implications of the
   Pandemic related to the physical, fiscal, and emotional health of rural
   citizens, the Pandemic may have increased levels of polarization and
   thus contributed to a further eroding of fragile levels of social
   capital in these communities.},

Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES ON TURKEY},
Year = {2019},
Number = {60},
Pages = {153-176},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article aims to explore the views of the Turkish elite on the state
   of polarization in Turkey. By identifying four political frames-namely,
   harmony, continuity/decline, conspiracy, and conflict-that selected
   Turkish political and civil society elites use in discussing the
   phenomenon of polarization in the country through their contributions to
   a workshop and in-depth qualitative interviews, the article finds that
   there is a considerable degree of polarization among the Turkish elite
   regarding their views on the presence of polarization in Turkey.
   Moreover, this overlaps with the divide between the government and the
   opposition in the country. An analysis of the justificatory arguments
   employed in constituting the aforementioned frames shows that, while
   those elites who deny the existence of polarization seek its absence in
   essentialist characteristics of society, in reductionist comparisons
   with history, or in internal/external enemies, those who acknowledge
   polarization's presence look for its roots in political and
   institutional factors and processes. The article highlights how, given
   the denial of polarization by the pro-government elite and the
   substantial gap between the two camps' justificatory narratives, the
   currently reported high rates of polarization in Turkey can, at best, be
   expected to remain as is in the near future, barring a radical change in
   political constellations.},

Abstract = {Through the hard-boiled work of Massimo Carlotto, the research verifies
   the concept of justice according to his protagonist, the Alligator, an
   ex-musician, ex-convict and a new private detective. This character
   discovers a conspiracy well managed years ago in order to save the real
   guilty person, Mugwump. s son, from a murder and send to prison another
   one instead of him. This new fact (motivates/ urges/ forces) to him
   decide to declare the (victim. s/ imprisoned man. s) innocence and
   restore his dignity back to him. The power of a corrupted lobby and his
   past as an ex-prisoner prevent him to present evidence, not always
   collected by legal means, to justice, so he decides to achieve justice
   by his own and innovative tools in addition to using his own
   distinguished skills. In the introduction, I elaborated the reasons of
   choosing a modern writer like Carlotto. The first chapter is dedicated
   to the characteristics of this gender of mystery work and I provided
   examples through the writer. s work. In the second chapter, I underlined
   the skills and the modality which reflect the concept of justice adopted
   by the writer. Finally in the third chapter, I discussed about Carlotto.

Abstract = {In line with a general tendency of nationalists to hold pro-natalist
   views, African nationalists in Zimbabwe took a hostile position to
   family planning upon its introduction in 1957, arguing that it was part
   of a conspiracy to control the black population.  However, it was only
   after the unilateral declaration of independence in 1965 by the white
   settlers under Ian Smith that an official policy aimed at reducing
   African fertility emerged.  The African nationalists waged a consistent
   propaganda campaign against this policy, and the facilities that were
   established under it, as well as their personnel, became military
   targets during the guerrilla war in the late 1970s.
   After independence in 1980, the triumphant nationalists tried to
   maintain their pronatalist position.  But, with a postwar `baby boom'
   pushing the birth rate close to four per cent by the mid-1980s, the
   officials in charge of economic and social development concluded that
   society could not sustain such a high fertility rate.  Consequently,
   there was a reversal of policy, and by 1990 Zimbabwe had become an
   internationally recognized leader of family planning among developing
   countries.  For the most part, however, these changes have taken place
   without any real input by African women, who remained largely excluded
   from the male-dominated circles in which decisions about family planning
   were made.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted fundamental social
   institutions, and the media was no exception. Journalists were
   challenged to report on an outbreak of pressing health-related
   information, complicated by malinformation erupting in a time of
   enhanced public demand for reliable facts. This study uses in-depth
   interviews with journalists at leading news outlets- both public service
   and commercial, in Italy, Spain, and Bulgaria (N = 24) to examine how
   they responded to misinformation and disinformation arising in the
   initial months of the pandemic. Using the frameworks of journalistic
   epistemology and the hierarchy-of-influences model, we explored the
   norms, routines, and practices guiding journalists' truth claims as well
   as the individual, routine, organizational, and social-systems
   influences shaping their decision-making. We found three common
   narratives of conspiracy theories consistent across different media
   systems: ``big state{''} concerns, evident in people questioning the
   very existence of the coronavirus as a pretense for globally enforced
   state supervision on individual freedoms; ``big pharma,{''} or people
   blaming the lack of a cure for COVID-19 on pharmaceutical companies
   pushing for vaccinations; and ``big fear{''} attitude - falsehoods about
   vaccines potentially causing more harm than good, including changing
   people's DNA. We also discuss three common strategies journalists used
   to respond to COVID-misinformation: deflecting, countering and false
   equivalency approach.},

Abstract = {In Romania, an important role in the dissemination of scientific
   information, decisive for increasing confidence in the vaccination
   against COVID-19, was played not only by official communication,, but
   also by media professionals who covered this subject extensively. The
   present research analyses the opinions of 33 Romanian journalists, from
   the national and local press, aiming to find out their professional
   attitude regarding the vaccination campaign. The opinions were collected
   through the structured interview, applied through electronic
   communication channels, between February 20, 2021 and March 1, 2021.
   Several research questions were the basis of this article: how
   professional journalists understand the role of the press in a pandemic
   crisis, in which disinformation, fake news, and deceptive information,
   decreased trust in vaccination; how journalists relate to the state of
   balance and what they consider to be the role of the journalistic act,
   also in relation to the authorities. The most important result of this
   study is that many of the interviewed journalists believe that, in the
   context of the national and global health crisis, the correct
   information is based on scientific evidence and the coverage of official
   communication, with the role of professional journalism being to combat
   misinformation, pseudoscience, conspiracies, and fake news.},

Abstract = {Virtue Epistemology (VE) offers a specific approach to the problem of
   knowledge. The condition for the possibility of knowledge is the
   presence of certain intellectual abilities or traits in the subject -
   epistemic virtues. The task of VE is to compile a list of epistemic
   virtues, the development and cultivation of which should lead
   individuals to epistemic success with a high degree of probability. The
   vice epistemology arises as a branch of VE, which focuses not on
   virtues, but on vices that hinder achievement and deserve censure. Vices
   can be attributed to both individuals and communities. As a rule, those
   who tend to question the scientific consensus are considered to be
   vicious knowing communities: conspiracy theorists, denialists, religious
   fundamentalists, etc. The article argues that the logic of imputing
   blame for bad epistemic traits used in vice epistemology tends to turn
   from an epistemological tool into an ideological and political one.
   Since in the logic of the vice epistemology, ``vicious minds{''} pose a
   threat not only to themselves, but also to the health of modern
   democratic societies, the eradication of vices is a primary political
   task. Using the theoretical framework of S. Fuller's social
   epistemology, the author shows how the rhetoric of vice epistemology is
   used today in the fight against anti-intellectualism and epistemic
   populism.},

Abstract = {Background: With the development and innovation of digital information
   technologies and new-generation Internet information platforms, new
   types of information exchange methods have been spawned. It has broken
   the restriction of the traditional internet boundary, and integrated all
   round connections between people and objects.
   Methods: Based on the above progresses, digital multimedia contents
   distributed or published much more convenient on the internet than
   before and most of them without any copyright protection. The dishonest
   owner can easily copy and distribute digital multimedia content without
   reducing any perceptual quality. According to the relative concerns,
   watermark protocol networks play a very important role in the usage
   tracking and copyrights infringement authentication, etc. However, most
   of the watermark protocols always require a ``fully trusted third
   party{''}, which has a potential risk to suffer conspiracy attack.
   Results: Therefore, in this paper, we focus on designing a watermark
   protocol with trustless third party via blockchain for protecting
   copyrights of owners that they want to publish or distribute on the
   internet. The proposed watermark protocol includes three sub-protocols
   which covers the negotiation process, transaction process and
   identification processes.
   Conclusion: In addition, this paper also provides a fully detail
   analysis that describes the benefits and weaknesses of current solution.},

Abstract = {This essay considers how American Enlightenment moralists and
   Evangelical religious revivalists responded to Jacobinism at the College
   of New Jersey, which later became Princeton University, from 1800
   through 1817. At this time, disruptive student activities exemplified
   alleged American Jacobin conspiracies against civil society. The
   American response to Jacobins brought out tensions between two different
   competing intellectual currents at the College of New Jersey: a revival
   of Christian religious principles led by Princeton trustee Reverend
   Ashbel Green and, in contrast, the expansion of Samuel Stanhope Smith's
   system of moral education during his tenure as college president from
   1795 through 1812. As a moralist, Smith appealed to Scottish Common
   Sense philosophy in teaching the instinctive rules of duty as a way to
   correct unrestrained passions and moderate Jacobin radicalism. In doing
   so, Smith developed a moral quasi-relativism as an original feature of
   his moral philosophy and contribution to American Enlightenment
   intellectual culture. Green and like-minded religious revivalists saw
   Princeton student uprisings as Smith's failure to properly address
   irreligion. This essay shows the ways in which Jacobinism and then the
   emerging age of religious revivalism, known as the Second Great
   Awakening, arrived at the cost of Smith's Didactic Enlightenment at
   Princeton.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine why terminally-ill patients, family caregivers
   and health care providers make a pact of silence about the terminal
   status of the patient, and to identify the attitudes, experiences and
   opinions of family caregivers concerning the conspiracy of silence in
   palliative care.
   Methods: A qualitative phenomenological study based on an interpretive
   analysis, conducted in Primary Health Care, Seville, Spain. Study
   dimensions: knowledge of the diagnosis and prognosis of the condition;
   disclosure of information; reaction to information received, feelings
   and approach to death; information disclosed to the patient and reasons
   behind partial disclosure; communication between patients, families, and
   health care providers. Study population: Family caregivers of patients
   on palliative care suspicious about a pact of silence.
   Results: Family caregivers hamper professional-patient communication;
   use of deceit to conceal the truth; suspicion that the patient knows the
   truth; the clinician conceals the truth; paternalist attitudes; feelings
   of sadness, grief, resignation, acceptance of the disease.
   Conclusions: The pact of silence has negative effects on coping with
   death, quality of life in the last days of life, and mourning.
   Communication between patients, health care providers, and families
   should be improved to prevent the pact of silence, and help patients
   cope with death. (C) 2015 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In antitrust law, the state action doctrine allows states to take
   regulatory actions that would otherwise result in violations of the
   federal antitrust laws. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has not always
   provided clear guidance in its state action jurisprudence, and lower
   courts have expressed frustration with this doctrinally confusing area
   of antitrust law. There is confusion among the lower courts over the
   relationship between state action immunity and the related doctrine of
   federal antitrust preemption. Further, lower courts are confused as to
   how they should apply the Midcal two-pronged test regulating the
   availability of state action immunity to private actors. The judicial
   response to antitrust suits over the tobacco Master Settlement Agreement
   (MSA), a settlement signed between tobacco manufacturers and forty-six
   states, provides a stark example of this confusion. The Second and Third
   Circuits have held that the antitrust preemption and state action
   doctrines do not immunize the MSA from charges of facilitating a
   price-fixing conspiracy among cigarette makers, while five other
   circuits have held the contrary. This Note explores the MSA circuit
   split and contends that the Second and Third Circuits were correct in
   holding that antitrust preemption and state action immunity do not
   shield the MSA. This result is consistent with Supreme Court precedent
   and antitrust policy.},

Abstract = {``The Human Document{''} examines the representation of reading in
   Coetzee's novel Elizabeth Costello (2003) as an amoral ``conspiracy{''}
   or ``breathing together{''} of reader and fictional character. Reading
   so conceived erases the difference between real and fictional persons,
   permitting a fluid and promiscuous interpenetration of experience that a
   reader, at the moment of reading, is powerless to refuse. This
   circumstance challenges the premise of recent ethical theories of the
   novel. These propose that the reader conscientiously agrees to bracket
   his or her own values or experience while reading so as to allow a full
   experience of a character's alterity unconstrained by judgment or other
   preconceptions. In contrast, Elizabeth Costello proposes that the
   reader's experience while reading precludes consent or any other
   exercise of free will essential to an ethical act. Reading amounts
   instead to the involuntary activation of a synapse between reader and
   character which challenges the reader's foundational assumption, as a
   free agent, of his or her ontological priority over character. Insofar
   as fictional representation entails a kind of incarnation, it suggests
   the possibility of a literary ontology which Elizabeth Costello enacts
   through a peculiarly Coetzeean practice of doubling whose structure and
   significance are examined in this article.},

Abstract = {Actively open-minded thinking (AOT) is measured by items that tap the
   willingness to consider alternative opinions, sensitivity to evidence
   contradictory to current beliefs, the willingness to postpone closure,
   and reflective thought. AOT scales are strong predictors of performance
   on heuristics and biases tasks and of the avoidance of reasoning traps
   such as superstitious thinking and belief in conspiracy theories.
   Nevertheless, AOT is most commonly measured with questionnaires rather
   than performance indicators. Questionnaire contamination becomes even
   more of a danger as the AOT concept is expanded into new areas such as
   the study of fake news, misinformation, ideology, and civic attitudes.
   We review our 25-year history of studying the AOT concept and developing
   our own AOT scale. We present a 13-item scale that both is brief and
   accommodates many previous criticisms and refinements. We include a
   discussion of why AOT scales are such good predictors of performance on
   heuristics and biases tasks. We conclude that it is because such scales
   tap important processes of cognitive decoupling and decontextualization
   that modernity increasingly requires. We conclude by discussing the
   paradox that although AOT scales are potent predictors of performance on
   most rational thinking tasks, they do not predict the avoidance of
   myside thinking, even though it is virtually the quintessence of the AOT
   concept.},

Abstract = {This article analyses anti-fascist and anti-colonial political efforts
   carried out by white settlers in Angola, against Salazar's colonial
   dictatorship, between 1930 and 1945. It begins with an analysis of the
   origins and characteristics of the settlers' political protest,
   considering in particular the conflicted relationships between the
   colonists and the Estado Novo in the 1930s. The article then analyses
   the secessionist conspiracy in 1940/1941, which was promoted by a group
   of anti-fascist settlers in Angola, in close connection with the Union
   of South Africa. Additionally, the article deals with the action of an
   anti-colonial political organisation named Organizacao Socialista de
   Angola (OSA), which was the first Euro-African nationalist movement in
   Angola. OSA was mostly formed by young Angolan-born whites and mesticos,
   who demanded full political independence as well as the end of
   discrimination against all Angolans. However, OSA was severely repressed
   by the Portuguese authorities, and a number of anti-fascist settlers,
   including the Vicar General of the Catholic Church, were arrested and
   deported to Portugal. Nonetheless, despite the repression exerted by the
   dictatorship, the settlers' political protest, which was both
   anti-fascist and anti-colonial, had relevant repercussions in Angola,
   having contributed to the political structuring of Angolan nationalism
   in the 1940s.},

Abstract = {This research aims to understand the persuasion techniques used in
   Twitter posts about COVID-19 vaccines by the different vaccine
   sentiments (i.e., Pro-Vaccine, Anti-Vaccine, and Neutral) using the
   Elaboration Likelihood Model, Social judgment Theory, and the Extended
   Parallel Process Model as theoretical frameworks. A content analysis was
   conducted on a data set of 1,000 Twitter posts. The corpus of Tweets was
   examined using the persuasion frameworks; tweets that were identified as
   emanating from bots were further examined. Results found Anti-Vaccine
   messages predominantly used Anecdotal stories, Humor/Sarcasm, and
   Celebrity figures as persuasion techniques, while Pro-Vaccine messages
   primarily used Information, Celebrity figures, and Participation.
   Results also showed the Anti-Vaccine messages primarily focused on
   values related to the categories of Safety, Political/Conspiracy
   Theories, and Choice. Finally, results revealed Anti-Vaccine messages
   primarily used Perceived Severity and Perceived Susceptibility, which
   are fear appeal elements. The findings for messages by bots were
   comparable to the messages in the larger corpus of tweets. Based on the
   findings, a response framework-Health Information Persuasion Exploration
   (HIPE)-is proposed to address mis/disinformation and Anti-Vaccine
   messaging. The results of this study and the HIPE framework can inform a
   national COVID-19 vaccine health campaign to increase vaccine adoption.},

   and paganizers of the Church. According to the conspiracy doctrine
   typical of plot myths, the Jesuits are identified as the main, if not
   the only, root of all the evils that happened in the Church and in to
   the contemporary societies. This radically negative perspective creates
   an actual black myth and contrasts with other readings, some of which
   are radically different. As such, the Ignatians are also seen as the
   modernizers of the Church and qualified advisors to Kings and Princes,
   forerunners of human rights. This paper revisits and critically analyzes
   the characterization of these contrasting views, which make the Jesuits,
   both agents of dehumanization and humanization, from the perspective of
   the history of thought between the Early Modern and Modern periods. It
   also aims to know, beyond the blurry imagery created by anti- and
   pro-Jesuitic polemics, if we can consider the Jesuits relevant to a
   protohistory of human rights in the transition to the Contemporary
   Modern Period.},

Abstract = {In the last decades of the 3rd/9th and the first decades of the 4th/10th
   centuries, the city of Rayy seems to have been an important center of
   Isma'ili missionary activity not only in West Persia, but also in
   Mesopotamia, in Khurasan and the southern region of the Caspian Sea
   (Daylam). Organized as a secret society, the Qarmatian mission in Rayy,
   preparing the advent of the Mahdi Muhammad b. Isma'il, left only a few
   traces in Isma'ili sources, but has been described by hostile authors
   trying to prove that the Isma'ili movement is the offshoot of an old
   Zoroastrian conspiracy against Islam. When, during the 4th/10th century,
   the da'wa in Rayy recognized the authority of the Fatimids in Cairo, it
   still remained a secret organisation shrouded in obscurity. Dating from
   this period, however, we have an important document, al-Mimadhi's Risala
   ila jama'at ahl al-Rayy. The seize of Rayy by the Seljuqs in 446/1054
   coincides with the birth of Hasan al-Sabbah, the founder of Nizari
   Ismailism, who profoundly reformed the Fatimid doctrine and transformed
   the da'wa into an activist and military movement whose aim it was to
   create a Nizari state inside the Seljuq empire.},

Abstract = {Considered in this paper is the hypothesis for the influence of Mikhael
   Lermontov's novel ``The Princess Mery{''} on the novel by Gayto Gazdanov
   ``The Princess Mery{''}. An analysis is made of the personage structure
   of the works: in Gazdanov's work it is a peculiar love quadrangle,
   consisting of three men (pseudo-writer Maria, pseudo-actor Marcel and
   pseudo-boxer Pier) who are competing for one woman. And as this is
   taking place, on the metalevel there is the story-teller who is trying
   to unravel the mystery of the pseudo-writer. We can see a similar
   structure in the novel by Lermontov: Pechorin plays the role of a
   pseudo-writer, Grushnitsky with his constant showing off behaves like a
   pseudo-actor, and the dragoon captain, whom Pechorin knocks down, is
   like a pseudo-boxer. On the metalevel there is an officer story-teller
   who is trying to solve the mystery of Pechorin's personality and who has
   published his Diary. Also considered is the type of a
   storyteller-analyst and his functions, the pseudo-writer's motives,
   those of conspiracy, honour, hierarchy, highest force, true reality, and
   insincere friend's motives: motivic complexes of ``intermediate
   states{''} and ``femininity{''}},

Abstract = {This article provides a contextual analysis of the assassination attempt
   on the Timurid ruler Shahrukh's life on 21 February 1427 in Herat.
   According to the contemporary Timurid chroniclers, Ahmad-i Lur, a Hurufi
   by profession, tried to kill Shahrukh. Having survived the attack with
   light injuries, Shahrukh reacted harshly and executed many of those who
   were accused of conspiring against him. During the interrogations, many
   other intellectuals who professed as a method of inquiry the `ilm-i
   huruf ( the science of letters) were also accused of participating in
   the conspiracy. In this article, I treat the assassination attempt as a
   moment of crisis in Timurid politics, study it in relation to the
   transformation of the intellectual landscape towards the mid-fifteenth
   century, and provide an in-depth textual and contextual analysis of the
   historiographical sources as well as the writings of those intellectuals
   who left a first-hand testimony of the subsequent interrogations. After
   a close scrutiny of the available evidence, I demonstrate that the
   interrogations of those intellectuals who practiced the science of
   letters predated the assassination attempt, and I argue that the
   assassination attempt was just an episode, albeit an important one, in
   Shahrukh's attempts to control and regulate the emerging public sphere
   in Iran and Central Asia.},

Abstract = {People are often exposed to fake news. Such an exposure to misleading
   information might lead to false memory creation. We examined whether
   people can form false memories for COVID-19-related fake news.
   Furthermore, we investigated which individual factors might predict
   false memory formation for fake news. In two experiments, we provided
   participants with two pieces of COVID-19-related fake news along with a
   non-probative photograph. In Experiment 1, 41\% (n = 66/161) of our
   sample reported at least one false memory for COVID-19-related fake
   news. In Experiment 2, even a higher percentage emerged (54.9\%; n =
   185/337). Moreover, in Experiment 2, participants with conspiracy
   beliefs were more likely to report false memories for fake news than
   those without such beliefs, irrespective of the conspiratorial nature of
   the materials. Finally, while well-being was found to be positively
   associated with both true and false memories (Experiment 1), only
   analytical thinking was negatively linked to the vulnerability to form
   false memories for COVID-19-related fake news (Experiment 2). Overall,
   our data demonstrated that false memories can occur following exposure
   to fake news about COVID-19, and that governmental and social media
   interventions are needed to increase individuals' discriminability
   between true and false COVID-19-related news.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyse euphemisms with regard to the twelve spheres of
   communication. The analysis of the usage of the euphemisms found in
   different works of Russian folklore. Stated that the relationship with
   the prohibitions and secret languages find puzzles, by tradition,
   embracing the conventions of the mystery of speech, and Proverbs,
   closely intertwined with reality. It is shown that for the names of
   characters in fairy tales Russian, reflecting the superstitions of our
   ancestors, are used euphemistically name by name and patronymic.
   Illustrates a variety of word replacement due to the ban be called
   `late' in the language of funeral laments. Seems the euphemisms in the
   naming of the groom and the bride, the matchmakers, the bridesmaids and
   other wedding ``ranks{''}. Examples euphemistically substitutions, which
   are contained in a seasonal calendar songs and rites. Describes how
   effeminacy in the children's rhyme, associated with belief in many
   Nations in lucky and unlucky numbers and the subsequent tabwemasana
   numbers. Examples of tabwemasana conspiracies and spells when naming and
   difficult situations as a magical action over the name. The conclusions
   that the presence of a large number of euphemisms in oral folk art,
   originated in ancient times, reflects the superstitions of our ancestors
   and existed in connection with them bans.},

Abstract = {This study aims to identify motivators and barriers regarding
   Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination among Latvian healthcare
   workers (HCWs). Data were collected from March to May 2021 using an
   online survey. Overall, 1,444 participants took part in the study. From
   this pool of respondents, 528 indicated motivating factors in favor of
   the COVID-19 vaccination (86.5\% were women; aged between 20 and 75
   years), while 198 mentioned barriers against the COVID-19 vaccination
   (92.9\% were women; aged between 19 and 68 years). The thematic analysis
   was conducted on two open-ended questions. The main motivators reported
   for COVID-19 vaccination were belief in the effectiveness of the
   vaccine, benefits of easing COVID-19 restrictions, responsibility, and
   restriction or pressure in case of non-vaccination. The main barriers
   reported regarding the COVID-19 vaccination were concerns about the
   effectiveness and safety of vaccines, perceived health risks of
   vaccination, risk perception toward COVID-19, misinformation about
   COVID-19 vaccines, belief that vaccination is being imposed, and belief
   in the conspiracy theories surrounding COVID-19. The results of this
   study help identify the existing motivating and hindering factors for
   COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs in Latvia. These results can be used to
   promote vaccination in HCW, develop information campaigns, and alleviate
   concerns of HCW.},

Abstract = {A conceptual study of Hitler's development of the National Socialist
   democracy concept between 1919 and 1933 is presented. Despite the
   voluminous literature on Hitler and Nazism, our knowledge of the NS
   democracy concept is seriously incomplete. This article makes a
   substantial historiographical contribution by providing a more profound
   understanding of Hitler's NS democracy concept and his position in the
   broader Weimar debate on democracy. I argue that Hitler prioritized
   democracy as a core concept in NS ideology. Between 1920 and 1925,
   Hitler employed a Germanic democracy concept centred on a popularly
   elected Fuhrer modelled in the reversed mirror image of his Jewish
   democracy concept. The allegedly Jewish interpretation of democracy was,
   according to Hitler's conspiracy theory, a precursor for the Jews to
   achieve a global dictatorship. Between 1925 and 1933 Hitler resettled
   for an anti-plebiscitary Volksherrschaft concept, abandoning his
   Germanic democracy, the election of the Fuhrer, and elections per se.
   This new concept rested on a notion of a Volkswille, which purportedly
   accommodated a genuine will of the people that could not be expressed in
   plebiscites and was identical with Hitler's worldview. I contend that
   Hitler's changeover from Germanic democracy to Volksherrschaft
   contributed to a totalitarian turn in NS ideology.},

Title = {Reasoning on Controversial Science Issues in Science Education and
   Science Communication},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The ability to make evidence-based decisions, and hence to reason on
   questions concerning scientific and societal aspects, is a crucial goal
   in science education and science communication. However, science denial
   poses a constant challenge for society and education. Controversial
   science issues (CSI) encompass scientific knowledge rejected by the
   public as well as socioscientific issues, i.e., societal issues grounded
   in science that are frequently applied to science education. Generating
   evidence-based justifications for claims is central in scientific and
   informal reasoning. This study aims to describe attitudes and their
   justifications within the argumentations of a random online sample (N =
   398) when reasoning informally on selected CSI. Following a
   deductive-inductive approach and qualitative content analysis of written
   open-ended answers, we identified five types of justifications based on
   a fine-grained category system. The results suggest a topic-specificity
   of justifications referring to specific scientific data, while
   justifications appealing to authorities tend to be common across topics.
   Subjective, and therefore normative, justifications were slightly
   related to conspiracy ideation and a general rejection of the scientific
   consensus. The category system could be applied to other CSI topics to
   help clarify the relation between scientific and informal reasoning in
   science education and communication.},

Abstract = {In schizophrenia research, patients who ``jump to conclusions{''} in
   probabilistic reasoning tasks tend to display impaired decision-making
   and delusional belief. In five studies, we examined whether jumping to
   conclusions (JTC) was similarly associated with decision impairments in
   a nonclinical sample, such as reasoning errors, false belief,
   overconfidence, and diminished learning. In Studies 1a and 1b, JTC was
   associated with errors stimulated by automatic reasoning, oddball
   beliefs such as conspiracy theories, and overconfidence. We traced these
   deficits to an absence of controlled processing rather than to an undue
   impact of automatic thinking, while ruling out roles for plausible
   alternative individual differences. In Studies 2 and 3, JTC was
   associated with higher confidence despite diminished performance in a
   novel probabilistic learning task (i.e., diagnosing illnesses), in part
   because those who exhibited JTC behavior were prone to overly exuberant
   theorizing, with no or little data, about how to approach the task early
   on. In Study 4, we adapted intervention materials used in schizophrenia
   treatment to train participants to avoid JCT. The intervention quelled
   overconfidence in the probabilistic learning task. In summary, this
   research suggests that a fruitful crosstalk may exist between research
   on psychopathology and work on social cognition within the general
   public.},

Title = {When elites polarize over polarization: Framing the polarization debate
   in Turkey},
Journal = {NEW PERSPECTIVES ON TURKEY},
Year = {2018},
Number = {59},
Pages = {109-133},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article aims to explore the views of the Turkish elite on the state
   of polarization in Turkey. By identifying four political frames-namely,
   harmony, continuity/decline, conspiracy, and conflict-that selected
   Turkish political and civil society elites use in discussing the
   phenomenon of polarization in the country through their contributions to
   a workshop and in-depth qualitative interviews, the article finds that
   there is a considerable degree of polarization among the Turkish elite
   regarding their views on the presence of polarization in Turkey.
   Moreover, this overlaps with the divide between the government and the
   opposition in the country. An analysis of the justificatory arguments
   employed in constituting the aforementioned frames shows that, while
   those elites who deny the existence of polarization seek its absence in
   essentialist characteristics of society, in reductionist comparisons
   with history, or in internal/external enemies, those who acknowledge
   polarization's presence look for its roots in political and
   institutional factors and processes. The article highlights how, given
   the denial of polarization by the pro-government elite and the
   substantial gap between the two camps' justificatory narratives, the
   currently reported high rates of polarization in Turkey can, at best, be
   expected to remain as is in the near future, barring a radical change in
   political constellations.},

Title = {Do Modern Radicals Believe in Their Mythologies? A Comparison between
   the Muslim Brotherhood and the Legion of the Archangel Michael in the
   Light of Four Political Mythologies},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {103-135},
Abstract = {This study seeks to employ the concept of political mythology in order
   to test the applicability of a comparative grid applied to two
   discursive orders produced by one salient expression of modern Islamic
   fundamentalism/radicalism and by the interwar European extreme right.
   Narrowing the perspective, the study intends to compare the fundamental
   texts of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and of the Romanian Legion of
   the Archangel Michael (Legiunea Arhanghelului Mihail) by resorting to
   four political mythologies coined by the French historian Raoul
   Girardet: the Conspiracy, the Savior, the Golden Age and Unity. My
   hypothesis can be summarized as follows: as imaginative acts of world
   creation/destruction, political mythologies are structures of meaning
   which allow a comparative approach that preserves intact the tension
   between similarity and difference. Therefore, Wittgenstein's
   epistemological edge of the theory of `family resemblance' could be
   amplified by the employment of political mythologies. Consequently the
   broad ranging cross-boundary comparisons gain systematic value without
   falling into the trap of rigid taxonomies. Consequently I seek to
   demonstrate that despite a basic structure of similarities, the
   fundamentalism of the Islamic Brotherhood and the radicalism of the
   Romanian extreme right appear in the light of political mythologies as
   bearing features that differ markedly from the Islamofascist paradigm.},

Title = {Insecurity Dilemma and the Tibetan Uprising in 2008},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {69},
Pages = {183-203},
Abstract = {In March 2008, Tibet erupted in the biggest challenge to Chinese rule
   since 1959. While Beijing and Dharamsala engaged in their familiar
   battle of representations, pundits speculated on the causes of the
   uprising, ranging from conspiracy theories to informed policy analysis.
   Applying the framework of the insecurity dilemma, this article argues
   that Tibetan identity insecurity on account of the post-1989 hard-line
   Chinese policies was the chief cause of the uprising. Largely peaceful
   protests and occasionally violent riots in Tibet have been integral to
   Tibetan efforts to mitigate their societal insecurities provoked by
   Chinese migration, `assimilationist' policies and `cultural
   imperialism'. However, Tibetan protests and riots heighten Chinese
   insecurities and harden Beijing's policies both inside Tibet and towards
   the Dalai Lama. This paper reveals the dynamic cycle of hard-line
   Chinese policies provoking Tibetan uprisings; the resulting hardening in
   Chinese policies feeds back into Tibetan insecurities and protests. The
   2008 uprising was the most recent cycle in the long-running saga of the
   Sino-Tibetan insecurity dilemma. The article warns that unless the
   Tibetans and the Chinese find a way to break out of the insecurity
   dilemma, Tibet could explode into another frenzy of violence and
   counter-violence in the near future.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the history of personalities and ideas in the
   Hungarian psychoanalytic movement during the years of political turmoil
   in the country. Sandor Ferenczi, Imre Hermann, as well as emigrants,
   such as Michael Balint, Franz Alexander, Sandor RadA(3), Therese Benedek
   and many others, are presented in the particular context of the
   political history of the time determined by Horthy, Hitler and Stalin.
   Important themes of the Budapest psychoanalytic research, such as the
   relational perspective, pregenital development and a mother-centered
   theory, as well as the beginnings of the direct observation of primates
   and human infants (Hermann, Spitz, Mahler) are examined. The
   relationships between the psychoanalytic group and the literary
   environment are mapped. The question is raised as to whether
   psychoanalytic treatment is feasible at all under totalitarian regimes.
   Even without psychoanalytic institutes and without freedom of assembly,
   in a kind of atmosphere of conspiracy, the psychoanalytic tradition and
   knowledge nevertheless survived 40 years of communist oppression. Using
   the example of jokes, the author demonstrates the role of such
   collective defense mechanisms, which at the same time create a form of
   solidarity. The joke, this old companion of psychoanalysis and part of
   the folklore of big cities, appears here again to help fortify the
   identity of oppressed populations.},

Title = {The Travels of Treason},
Journal = {MODERN LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 5},
Abstract = {The law of treason has been criticised for being based on `outdated'
   statutes which are inflexible and unsuitable for modern needs. However,
   a historical examination of the evolution of treason in Britain and its
   empire suggests that the law was often adaptable. In nineteenth century
   England, jurists wished to rein in older constructive treasons, to leave
   the 1351 Act as the appropriate law for wartime treasons, while the more
   lenient 1848 Act was to be used against `political' conspiracies to
   subvert the state by force. However, the `constructive' treasons
   remained part of the law, and were given new life in imperial contexts.
   In Ireland and Canada, the idea that plotting the king's `political'
   death was treason remained central to understandings of the 1351 Act. In
   India, the interpretation of the provision of the penal code against
   `waging war' against the government was influenced by old English ideas
   of `constructive' treason and used against those who challenged British
   rule. Imperial understandings of treason were also shaped by cases
   arising out of the Boer war, where the underlying law was Roman-Dutch
   law. Rather than being restrictive and unable to adapt to modern needs,
   the law of treason was flexible and malleable.},

Abstract = {Distance duality relation (DDR) marks a fundamental difference between
   expanding and nonexpanding universes, as an expanding metric causes
   angular diameter distance smaller than luminosity distance by an extra
   factor of (1 + z). Here we report a test of this relation using two
   independent samples of ultracompact radio sources observed at 2.29 GHz
   and 5.0 GHz. The test with radio sources involves only geometry, so it
   is independent of cosmological models. Since the observed radio
   luminosities systematically increase with redshift, we do not assume a
   constant source size. Instead, we start with assuming the intensive
   property, luminosity density, does not evolve with redshift and then
   infer its evolution from the resultant DDR. We make the same assumption
   for both samples, and find it results in the same angular size-redshift
   relation. Interestingly, the resultant DDR is fully consistent with a
   nonexpanding universe. Imposing the DDR predicted by the expanding
   universe, we infer the radio luminosity density evolves as rho ( L )
   proportional to (1 + z)(3). However, the perfect agreement with a
   nonexpanding universe under the assumption of constant luminosity
   densities poses a conspiracy and fine-tuning problem: the size and
   luminosity density of ultracompact radio sources evolve in the way that
   precisely mimics a nonexpanding universe.},

Title = {Towards a fruitful concept of radicalisation: a synthesis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 3},
Abstract = {The term `radicalisation' is relatively new. It is mostly the result of
   the political climate since 2005, but now widely used in work on
   extremism, fundamentalism, conspiracism, fanaticism, terrorism, and
   counter-terrorism. But exactly what is radicalisation and can we still
   properly use the term in the face of the many objections that have been
   levelled against it? I defend a conception of radicalisation that
   combines the fourmain approaches in the literature, the so-called monist
   and pluralist, as well as the absolutist and relativist ones. It does so
   on the basis of conceptual analysis, reflective equilibrium and
   particular case studies. Since the term will not be going away, it is
   wiser to be as lucid on how one defines it as possible. Such a
   definition matters for three reasons: there is much confusion in the
   public debate about radicalisation, e.g. about Islamism, increasing
   right-wing radicalisation in Europe and North America, and the views of
   conspiracy thinkers and anti-vaxxers, the term `radicalisation' is also
   widely used in the academic literature on terrorism and
   counter-terrorism, but there is much unclarity about its relation to
   violence, to phenomena like fundamentalism, extremism, terrorism, and,
   finally, in order to be fruitful in research we need a definition that
   can be operationalized.},

Abstract = {Authoritarianism is no longer imposed largely through military
   repression; it now takes place by undermining the public imagination and
   using culture and its various apparatuses to weaken civic literacy and
   the public institutions fundamental to civic culture. This article
   argues that in the 21st century democracy has become fragile. Under the
   onslaught of what I call disimagination machines, education in its most
   repressive educational and cultural forms has shaped a mass
   consciousness that is susceptible to lies, conspiracy theories, and the
   antidemocratic values and social relations endemic to right-wing
   populist movements and emerging demagogues. The article argues that the
   United States is undergoing an unprecedented crisis of political culture
   and form of depoliticization that are more dangerous than the damaging
   public policies that emerged in the United States since the rise of
   neoliberal capitalism in the 1970s. Equally alarming is the fact that
   the crisis of neoliberal capitalism has not been matched by a crisis of
   ideas, even as the United States has increasingly been organized on
   fascist principles for the last few decades. The article concludes by
   arguing that culture follows politics and that we live in an age when
   education has to be come central to any strategy for engaging politics
   in the age of emerging authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {Past works have witnessed increased prevalence of complementary and
   alternative medicines (CAM) among women during pregnancy. This study
   aimed to identify psychological antecedents underlying CAM use through
   the exploration of various predictors. Drawing upon the literature on
   the use of CAM in contexts unrelated to pregnancy, this research
   explored the role of various predictors: perceived stress, beliefs about
   medicine, health locus of control (HLOC), health literacy, bullshit
   receptivity, and belief in conspiracy theories (CT). 376 Swiss women
   were recruited to complete a web-based questionnaire in which the use of
   different kinds of CAM was investigated. We performed hierarchical
   regression analyses with backward method to assess the overall variance
   explained by the predictors, as well as their unique contributions. We
   measured the number of CAM used during last pregnancy and frequency of
   use. Analyses showed that CAM use was positively associated with
   perceived stress, beliefs about medicine, internal HLOC, and belief in
   CT. in contrast, negative relationships were found with external HLOC,
   bullshit receptivity, and health literacy. By illuminating such factors,
   this research contributed to explaining why women may be tempted to
   choose CAM in place of conventional medicine, which may be of particular
   interest for health professionals in the planning of communication
   strategies aimed at limiting risks associated to their use during
   pregnancy.},

Abstract = {With the emergence and widespread application of cloud computing, the
   use of cloud platforms to solve the problem of secure multi-party
   computation has emerged as a new research direction. The traditional
   computation of a solid geometry is performed through mutual interactions
   between two parties, which is not suitable in an untrusted cloud
   computing environment. In this paper, we first design a basic protocol
   for a secure Euclidean distance calculation that is suitable for cloud
   platforms and can serve as a building block for other protocols on cloud
   platforms. Using the solution of the Euclidean distance problem as such
   a building block, we provide a new method that converts the problems of
   calculating solid triangular areas and solid tetrahedral volumes into
   the calculation of distances and determinants in three-dimensional
   space. Then, we discuss solid point-line distance calculations, which
   extent the idea of the spatial geometry security problem. We present
   protocols for the above problems and prove that the proposed protocols
   can resist conspiracy among users and the untrusted cloud platform so
   that they can effectively ensure the privacy of the users. We also
   analyze the performances of these solutions. The analysis results show
   that our scheme is more versatile.},

Journal = {HEALTH PROMOTION PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-88},
Abstract = {Background: Social media is a driving force in the sharing of
   information. The purpose of this study is to describe fluoride related
   content on Instagram, a popular social media platform.
   Methods: Content categories were created and coded to better describe
   the nature of the posts. Data collection occurred in three sessions, two
   months apart. Only relevant posts that included images and had text
   written in the English language were included.
   Results: The most common topics were conspiracy theory, contained in
   37.3\% of posts, followed by dangers of fluoride to health (30.3\%) and
   benefits of fluoride to teeth (28.7\%). Of the posts reviewed, 96/300
   (32.0\%) contained pro-fluoride content while 139/300 (63.0\%) posts
   featured anti-fluoride content. Content varied significantly between
   pro-and anti-fluoride posts.
   Conclusion: Our review of Instagram posts revealed that there were
   approximately 300 posts focused on fluoride related content. Of these
   posts, there was a higher number of anti-fluoride related content
   compared to pro-fluoride related content. With accessibility comes the
   potential for misinformation. Future efforts from medical providers need
   to focus on educating consumers about reliable sources for health
   information on the internet.},

Title = {Ten Days of Tumult: The Mass Strike of 1842 in the West Riding of
   Yorkshire},
Journal = {YORKSHIRE ARCHAEOLOGICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {90},
Number = {1},
Pages = {128-157},
Abstract = {Variously termed the Plug Riots', general strike', or strike wave', the
   industrial unrest that hit northern England in the summer of 1842 was
   perhaps the most serious in modern British history. This article offers
   the first detailed account of this mass strike in the West Riding,
   showing how pickets from Lancashire and Cheshire successfully persuaded
   Yorkshire communities (including women) to assume the direction of the
   action. The article also analyses its causes, character, and the factors
   that led to the mass strike's failure. Chief among the latter was the
   rapid militarisation of West Riding industrial centres to back civil
   authority's response to the strike. The interpretation (widely
   circulated at the time) that the strike was a conspiracy by mill owners
   who supported the Anti-Corn Law League to promote political unrest is
   refuted. Although some historians have seen the strike as purely a
   movement to raise wages (typically to their 1840 levels), this article
   argues that support for the Chartist movement was decisive in shaping
   it. However, it is shown that not all strikers necessarily identified
   their actions with Chartism, while key figures in the movement's
   leadership suspected ACLL involvement and/or were fearful that official
   suppression meant strike action could not be sustained.},

Title = {Police harassment and the politicization of Jewish youth in interwar
   Bessarabia},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN JEWISH AFFAIRS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {47},

Pages = {62-84},
Abstract = {The article analyzes how regionalist antagonism and ideological bias
   mediated Romanian police officials' surveillance of the Jewish community
   in interwar Bessarabia. It compares the characterizations of Jewish
   politics found in police files from Bessarabia with those in
   Yiddish-language autobiographies by Bessarabian Jewish young people.
   Because officials attributed subversive, conspiratorial intent to
   movements across the Jewish political spectrum, they were never
   motivated to acquire more than a cursory understanding of the complex
   Jewish political arena they were surveilling. Had their intelligence not
   been hampered by lack of relevant language skills, mistrust of all
   Bessarabians regardless of ethnicity, and antisemitic stereotypes,
   officials might have seen that the young people they found so
   threatening were involved in highly ineffective and powerless politics.
   Instead, Romanian officials and Bessarabian Jewish youth were caught in
   a cycle of intractable cultural misunderstanding: police harassment
   exacerbated frantic and ideologically incoherent political activity
   among Jewish youth, which in turn reinforced suspicions of a Jewish
   Bolshevik conspiracy. I argue that this dynamic conforms in some
   respects to regional patterns, but that those patterns alone are
   insufficient for understanding this case. Rather, the encounter between
   Romanian officials and Bessarabian Jews is reminiscent of a colonial
   encounter, one in which cultural misunderstandings have hardened into
   intractable distrust.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Central Bank of Denver a First
   Interstate Bank of Denver eliminated federal private securities actions
   against secondary parties based on aiding and abetting and possibly on
   conspiracy, respondeat superior and common law agency as well. It is
   then reasonable to expect more private actions against secondary parties
   will be based on control person liability, which has explicit statutory
   authority in federal and state law This Article examines secondary
   liability in private actions against controlling persons under section
   15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 20 of the Securities
   Exchange Act of 1934 in cases not involving broker-dealers (for whom a
   separate jurisprudence has developed). It addresses the specific
   statutory language, the legislative history and the relevant judicial
   decisions to establish a prima facie action against controlling persons
   under section 15 and section 20 as well as the elements of defenses
   that, must be established to avoid liability The Article concludes that
   the law with respect to controlling person liability and sections 15 and
   20 is unpredictable and confusing, in short subject to the same
   uncertainties that motivated the Supreme Court to abolish aider and
   abetter and, perhaps, other theories of secondary liability in Central
   Bank.},

Abstract = {A great amount of research has noted the existence of a gap between
   election winners and losers in relation to perceptions of electoral
   fairness and satisfaction with democracy. One aspect of the winner-loser
   gap that has been overlooked is the impact of citizens' expectations
   about election outcomes on these attitudes. More precisely, how do
   citizens react to unexpected defeats and victories? Are individuals on
   the losing side less critical of the electoral process or dissatisfied
   with democracy when they recognize beforehand that their favourite party
   or candidate was likely to be defeated? Does experiencing a surprise
   victory lead to a boost in perceived electoral integrity or democratic
   satisfaction? To answer these questions, I use data from the 1996, 2000,
   2004, 2012, 2016 and 2020 ANES. While there is little evidence that
   expectations exert a major influence on post-election attitudes, outcome
   unexpectedness seems to have decreased confidence in the vote counting
   process among losers, independents and even winners in the 2020
   election. The results show the considerable influence that fraud claims
   and conspiracy theories can have on public opinion when elected
   officials and candidates push a consistent story line of electoral
   malfeasance and corruption in an effort to denigrate political
   opponents.},

Abstract = {Why is far-right rhetoric so dangerous? In recent years, scholars and
   policy makers alike have striven to unpack the black box of extremists'
   online communication and the rise of far-right violence. Particularly
   the role of social media in spreading hate speech and fostering
   radicalization has caught a lot of attention; however, there has been
   little success in pinning down the drivers of violence. Drawing on the
   concept of dangerous speech, we take a step back from the violent
   effects of far-right online communication. Instead, we examine its
   logical functioning to illuminate the upstream processes that constitute
   hate and legitimize violence. More concretely, we study how far-right
   narratives employed on social media mobilize emotions that prepare for
   the acceptance or even use of violence. Analyzing the argumentative
   structures of two anti-immigration campaigns in Germany, we find a
   network of narratives where narratives of imperilment- supported by
   narratives of conspiracy and inequality-converge into a greater story of
   national threat and awakening. By constructing a situation of collective
   self-defense, violence becomes a logical option, even if violent action
   is not explicitly proposed. Counter-narrative efforts should thus not
   only focus on hate speech but also address the myths of victimhood,
   which are constitutive of (violent) palingenetic fantasies.},

Abstract = {We have observed a field in Baade's Window using the Wide Field Camera
   of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and obtain V- and I-band photometry
   down to V approximately 22.5. These data go several magnitudes fainter
   than previously obtained from the ground.  The location of the break in
   the luminosity function suggests that there are a significant number of
   intermediate age (< 10 Gyr) stars in the Galactic bulge. This conclusion
   rests on the assumptions that the extinction towards our field is
   similar to that seen in other parts of Baade's Window, that the distance
   to the bulge is approximately 8 kpc, and that we can determine fairly
   accurate zero points for the HST photometry. Changes in any one of these
   assumptions could increase the inferred age, but a conspiracy of lower
   reddening, a shorter distance to the bulge, and/or photometric
   zero-point errors would be needed to imply a population entirely older
   than 10 Gyr. We infer an initial mass function slope for the
   main-sequence stars, and find that it is consistent with that measured
   in the solar neighborhood; unfortunately, the slope is poorly
   constrained because we sample only a narrow range of stellar mass and
   because of uncertainties in the observed luminosity function at the
   faint end.},

Journal = {PHILOSOPHY \& SOCIAL CRITICISM},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {In our text, we follow the traces of a (1) paradox, (2) an ambivalence
   and (3) a dialectic that constitute digitalized public spheres and
   discuss the resulting tensions in discourse-ethical and
   political-theoretical perspectives using the blocking of Donald J.
   Trump's Twitter account as an example. Starting from this, we determine
   the conditions of constitution of the digital public sphere and locate
   the dynamics of its development in the dialectical tension between
   private and public: The fact that the two other relations of autonomy
   and heteronomy, intensification and polarization come to such a head is
   based on an insufficient socialization of all those means of production
   that produce the current digital public sphere. Using the example of
   Donald J. Trump's recently suspended Twitter account and with a view to
   Habermas's discourse ethics, we illustrate the extent to which Trump's
   partly racist and conspiracy-theoretical post violates discourse ethics
   standards and is also highly problematic with regard to the political;
   however, banishment from a part of the digital public sphere is
   certainly not an act that should be incumbent on a private company. From
   this, we conclude that the normative potentials of digital public
   spheres can only be vol.},

Title = {COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and Implications for Economic Recovery:
   Evidence from Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality in South Africa},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy is a growing threat to public health
   with far-reaching implications. The widening gap between the vaccinated
   and the proportion of vaccinated people needed for herd immunity raises
   two critical research questions that are of interest to practitioners,
   researchers, and policymakers: (1) What determines one's decision to be
   vaccinated? (2) What is the implication of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy
   for economic recovery? In this study, we use empirical data in the
   context of South Africa to investigate factors affecting COVID-19
   vaccine hesitancy and their implications for economic recovery. Findings
   reveal key socio-demographic and institutional drivers of COVID-19
   vaccine hesitancy, which include age (the youth are more hesitant),
   inadequate information on the vaccine (those who perceive they have
   adequate information are vaccinated), trust issues in government
   institutions, conspiracy beliefs, vaccine-related factors, and perceived
   side effects associated with the vaccine. Additionally, an individual's
   decision to remain hesitant about COVID-19 vaccination has implications
   for businesses and the economy by limiting movement and trade,
   increasing unemployment, and causing a resurgence of new variants. Based
   on the findings, action plans such as information dissemination,
   convenience vaccination centers, consistent communications, and targeted
   campaign strategies are recommended for improving vaccine uptake and a
   positive economic recovery.},

Abstract = {The current debate in the academic sphere regarding the role of extreme
   right-wing parties during the coronavirus pandemic extends to its
   communicative aspect. While some authors argue that these parties have
   focused their messages on the perspectives of fear, the threat
   represented by immigrants, or conspiracies in an unsuccessful way, even
   considering them to be the ``losers of the crisis,{''} others emphasize
   their ability to build a sense of community through resilience. The
   present research aims to take up these discussions and delve deeper into
   the study of the communicative frames of European political parties,
   with a particular focus on the far right, to draw more nuanced
   conclusions. For this purpose, a double methodology has been implemented
   through the coding of the frames used in a total of 2,757 Twitter posts
   during the month of March 2020 from the major government and extreme
   right-wing parties in Germany, France, Spain, and Poland. The results
   show that the parties studied present differences in their communicative
   frames, not according to their position on the ideological spectrum, as
   might be expected, but rather to their role as the executive power in
   the government or as part of the opposition of their respective
   legislative chambers.},

Title = {Shouting Into the Wind: Medical Science versus ``B.S.{''} in the Twitter
   Maelstrom of Politics and Misinformation About Hydroxychloroquine},
Journal = {SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY},

Abstract = {In the social media marketplace of ideas during the 2020 coronavirus
   pandemic, epidemiologists and other scientific and medical experts
   competed for attention with news media, government agencies,
   politicians, celebrities, and rank conspiracy theorists. However,
   everyone with a Twitter account was not equally qualified to speak
   knowledgeably about critical issues related to the outbreak, such as
   prevention and treatment. And, accurate information from informed
   sources can mean the difference between life and death. Our exploratory
   study addresses a simple, but important question: whose messages about
   the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for coronavirus were
   getting the most attention on Twitter? We provide a data visualization
   of Twitter activity for the period of 21 January through 21 May 2020
   that shows users who tweeted about hydroxychloroquine, as well as who
   interacted with each of them (through likes, comments, retweets, etc.)
   to determine who were the most prominent voices on the network during a
   critical juncture of the outbreak. From our analysis, it appears that
   President Donald Trump's handle (@realDonaldTrump) and other pro-Trump
   related accounts were the most influential voices on Twitter during this
   time of the crisis, rather than those from relevant experts, such as the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (@CDCgov) or the National
   Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (@NIAIDnews).},

Journal = {GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {COVID-19 is highlighting and exposing how public health and geopolitics
   intersect across spaces, scales, and settings. Existing literature
   focuses on the geopolitical determinants of health such as the
   allocation of foreign health-related assistance in postcolonial spaces
   and the relationship between population health and the health impacts of
   exploiting resources for economic benefit. How populist nationalism
   shapes public reactions to disease has also been documented. There is a
   popular geopolitical dimension to how COVID-19 is portrayed-with
   expertise questioned, conspiracies circulated, lockdowns contested, and
   mask-wearing ridiculed. Calls to keep ``foreign{''} pathogens and
   viruses out of national territory carry with them possibilities for
   exceptional measures, xenophobic politics, and heightened surveillance
   on the border and beyond. The place of the World Health Organization
   (WHO) within global health security remains complicated by the
   intersection of public health and geopolitical contexts. By using three
   themes, within and beyond the WHO, we explore how COVID-19 has been
   productive of three geopolitical narratives: public health as emblematic
   of great power rivalries, the bordering of the virus, and the (surgical)
   facemask as power projection. Our paper concludes with an assessment of
   how important it is to track and trace the relationship between health
   and geopolitics.},

Abstract = {During the 1920s and 1930s, newspaper and magazine accounts of narcotics
   problems, and the propaganda of various anti narcotic organizations used
   certain stock ideas and images to construct an intensely fearful public
   rhetoric about drugs. Authors routinely described drugs, users, and
   sellers as ``evil,{''} described sinister conspiracies to undermine
   American society and values, credited drugs with immense power to
   corrupt users, and called for complete eradication of the problem. That
   rhetoric became the standard template for American public discourse
   about drugs, and is still in use. Very similar themes and images,
   however, were used in earlier crusades against Masons, Catholics, and
   Mormons. This suggests that anti-drug discourse is linked to a larger
   American rherorical tradition, one that stems from Protestant-Republican
   ideology and cultural concerns-fears of being owned or controlled, fears
   of anarchy, fears of loss of dynamism, fears of falling away from past
   virtue and promise. In casting drugs and drug users as a ``Great
   American Enemy{''} reformers not only addressed the existing social
   problems posed by drug use, but attempted, through a culturally resonant
   rhetorical form, to provide their audience with explanations and
   rallying points, and help them define or recover a sense of cultural
   identity and purpose.},

Abstract = {The article is dedicated to the American Nativism before the Civil War.
   Nativism is an opposition to immigration and to an internal minority on
   the grounds of its imputed foreign connections. The term `nativism'
   distinguishes between Americans who were born in the U.S., and the
   `first generation' immigrants. In Protestant countries it is often
   closely tied to anti-Catholicism. This theme was popular since the
   Protestant Reformation, stimulated by American fears of French, Spanish,
   and papal threats in the New World. Anti-Catholicism peaked from the
   1830s through the 1850s, concomitant with the growing debate over
   slavery.},

Abstract = {Introduction: COVID-19 has spread globally, thereby contributing to
   substantial hospitalisation rates and morbidity. However, little or no
   information is available on the experiences of patients with COVID-19 in
   an African-setting. The study aimed to explore the experiences of
   patients with COVID-19. Methods: semi-structured interviews were
   conducted via telephone with eleven individuals who were managed and
   discharged due to COVID-19. A descriptive phenomenological approach to
   qualitative research was employed and participants were mainly asked
   about their experiences before, during and after hospitalisation for
   COVID-19. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: patients'
   viewpoints were suggestive of community and secondary transmission of
   COIVD-19 in the study area. A few participants experienced severe
   symptoms. Most participants tend to resign their condition to fate;
   while some displayed unfounded conspiracy theories. Nevertheless,
   precautionary measures to prevent infection were largely observed.
   COVID-19 also negatively affected activities of daily living of the
   participants. Furthermore, the participants were generally satisfied
   with quality of care provided. However, areas of patients' education,
   isolation centre set-up and caregiver-patient interaction needed further
   improvements. Lastly, experience of fear and stigma during
   post-hospitalisation were common. Conclusion: COVID-19 impacted
   negatively on the lives of the studied population. However, their
   experience during hospitalisation was generally positive.},

Abstract = {Orson Welles' experimental essay film', F for Fake (1973), captures in
   short form what the prodigious director's life expressed in grander
   gestures: a speculative geography for an accident-prone cinema.
   Documenting the fakery techniques of famed 20th-century art forger Elmyr
   de Hory and his biographer Clifford Irving, the film has been widely
   read as a showcase of Welles' own charlatanism'. Indeed, even Deleuze's
   philosophy of cinema claims that the ubiquitous Wellesian character' -
   the forger, the faker, the double-dealer - culminates in F for Fake.
   But, along with Welles' other late-life essay films, it also offers a
   pragmatic strategy for theorizing the sites of cinematic production on
   the basis of their constituent contingencies. For Welles the independent
   filmmaker, these uncertainties unfailingly manifested in financial,
   technological, and geographical disasters - problems that, I argue, he
   harnessed to cultivate a unique cinematic style'. The resulting
   Wellesian continuum' illuminates the conspiracy of perception, thoughts,
   and accident in the production of cinematic space. Offering how to'
   guide on forging series from the contingencies of production, Welles'
   meditation on fakery models the creation of such sites and lays out the
   conceptual architecture for theorizing their cinematic production.
   Welles' resulting ontology of cinematic seriality describes technical
   problematics - anti-techniques' - that give rise to speculative
   geographies.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the origin and implications of the ``war on
   cancer{''} metaphor. Commonly present in mass media, the ``war on
   cancer{''} notion circulates also among patients, their loved ones,
   their support networks, and oncological multidisciplinary teams. In our
   view when cancer is uprooted of its illness status, and conceptualized
   as an ``enemy{''}, myths about disease and those who suffer it
   (especially the idea of psychogenesis) are strengthened. Two topics in
   which the war metaphor is particularly problematic in the clinical
   context, are analyzed in depth. The first one is the relationship
   between the oncologic patient and his or her loved ones and support
   networks. When patients are insistently prompted to fight the disease
   and think positive, the expression of emotions associated to the
   adaptive process of receiving a diagnosis of cancer may be inhibited.
   Secondly, the war metaphor promotes an authoritarian view among the
   health teams and on the physician-patient relationship, undermining the
   patent's autonomy in the decision-making process, which may affect his
   global quality of life. Also, it encourages emotional isolation,
   concealment of psychiatric symptoms and conspiracies of silence. It is
   concluded that public policies to avoid the ``war on{''} notion are
   required. Instead, education of the general population about wrong
   beliefs about cancer should be encouraged.},

Journal = {ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL-JAPAN FOCUS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},

Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {On December 14, 1959, amidst much fanfare and tears, the first
   repatriation boat (provided by the Soviet Union) carried thousands of
   Koreans from Niigata, Japan, to Cheongjin, North Korea. Hailed as a
   humanitarian project under the intermediation of the International
   Committee of the Red Cross, the repatriation of Koreans from Japan to
   North Korea continued until 1984, resulting in a total of more than
   93,000 repatriates who relocated from Japan to North Korea amidst the
   Cold War division of the world with the majority never to return to
   Japan again. This article addresses multiple aspects of this project,
   looking into the media portrayal of North Korea at the time of the
   opening of the repatriation and the more recent academic discussion
   following the de-classification of the International Committee of the
   Red Cross papers. Based on these, the article frames the repatriation in
   a new light with the suggestion of possibly thinking about it as a form
   of human trafficking without reducing it into a one-dimensional
   political event or conspiracy by one government or another. Instead, the
   article emphasizes that the structure of power that sustained the
   repatriation was complex and so were the lives that repatriates
   experienced.},

Abstract = {What relationship do the mainstream media have with online abuse on
   high-profile criminal cases? This article hopes to make a start at
   answering this question by examining tweets containing the \#McCann
   hashtag, utilised by a highly engaged community of users to comment on
   all matters related to the disappearance of British child Madeleine
   McCann. On \#McCann, the child's parents and other players are often
   singled out as the perpetrators of her disappearance and other crimes,
   in a blend of harassment, defamation and insults with conspiracy
   theories, disinformation and a strong anti-establishment vein typical of
   the posttruth era. Through an experimental digital ethnography blending
   elements of content and discourse analysis, this research has observed
   the \#McCann conversation and analysed 500 tweets with the hashtag,
   observing that some of the most offensive theories posted by users on
   Twitter reprised themes seen in the mainstream media at the time of the
   disappearance, which resulted in defamation lawsuits by the McCanns and
   in complaints about unethical reporting at the Leveson Inquiry. This
   raises questions about the mainstream media's responsibility and duty of
   care towards people they report on in the digital age, and showcases a
   symbiotic yet diffident relationship between anti-establishment online
   users and traditional news media.},

Abstract = {To compare and contrast medieval Japan and medieval Western Europe
   allows one to discover three things. First, analogous to Catholic holy
   war, in Japan becomes visible a potential for war (albeit seldom
   actualised) for the sake, quite surprisingly, of Buddhism. Second, the
   different role played by emotions during war: in Europe, when vicious
   (and motivated by emotions such as greed, ambition or lust), they
   endanger the victors; thus the concern for right emotions foster, to a
   point, proper behavior during war; in Japan, however, the focus is on
   the emotions of the defeated, which may hamper a good reincarnation and
   produce vengeful spirits harmful to the victors and to the community at
   large. Finally, while Japanese warriors could and often did switch
   sides, the archipelago did not know for centuries anything approaching
   the European concept of treason, ideally punished with the highest
   cruelty, hated and feared to the point of generating collective paranoia
   and conspiracy theories. Western treason was (and is still) a
   secularised offspring of the Christian belief in the internal enemy of
   the Church, the false brethren. Arguably, the texture of the religions

Abstract = {Despite the opening of Soviet archives, and the surge in scholarly
   interest in anti-Zionism, scholars have not used declassified archive
   documents to shed new light on Soviet anti-Zionism in the wake of the
   Six-Day War. Based on such documents, Gjerde's article challenges a view
   of post-1967 Soviet anti-Zionism that has been prevalent since it
   emerged during the Cold War: that it represented a disguised' form of
   antisemitism that Soviet leaders used as a political tool. To the
   contrary, Gjerde argues, the archive documents suggest Soviet
   anti-Zionism was more than a propaganda invention. Within higher Soviet
   echelons, a particular logic existed that fostered a view of Zionism' as
   an immense, conspiratorial threat to the Soviet Union. In one sense,
   this logic grew out of a more general tendency to view nonconformity as
   conspiracy: the Soviets had established extremely narrow boundaries for
   what constituted acceptable Jewish identity; and, when some Soviet Jews
   began to voice nationalist sentiments after the Six-Day War, Soviet
   leaders saw this expression of nonconformity as essentially a hostile
   act, warranting severe counter-measures. This is not to say Soviet
   anti-Zionism was not antisemitic but rather that to explain it merely as
   a propaganda tool is to ignore much of the complexity of its emergence.},

   clauses headed by hybrid nouns display different possibilities of
   agreement morphology on the relative pronoun koji/a/e `which',
   depending, on the one hand, on whether the relative clause is
   restrictive or non-restrictive and on the other, on the case of the
   relative pronoun. We argue that the observed differences are the result
   of a conspiracy of the following factors: (i) hybrid number-agreement
   nouns introduce a null plural pronoun unspecified for gender (Postal
   1966; den Dikken 2001; Torrego and Laga 2015), (ii) all plural case
   forms of the relative pronoun except for nominative and accusative show
   full gender syncretism (Alsina and Arsenijevic 2012b), and (iii)
   non-restrictive relative clauses involve a null definite pronoun and
   attach to the head noun higher than the restrictive relative clauses
   (Postal 1994; de Vries 2002; 2006). We maintain that the facts discussed
   in the paper argue against analyses which derive the differences between
   restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses from their LF
   representations, rather than from their overt syntax.},

Title = {On a red line across Europe: butchers and rebellions in
   fourteenth-century Siena},
Journal = {SOCIAL HISTORY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {72-92},
Abstract = {As a result of the role played in urban uprisings and conspiracies in
   late medieval and early modern western Europe, the butchers' trade has
   been one of the most intensively studied food-related occupations.
   Recent research on medieval butchers has shown a renewed interest in the
   topic. This article begins by presenting a review and synthesis of the
   historiography of butchers' revolts in late medieval cities across
   western Europe. It then moves on to an analysis of the specific case of
   Siena, based on original primary research. The aim of the article is to
   show how Sienese butchers rebelled more than once during the fourteenth
   century and to examine why it was inevitable that they failed, despite
   the long-standing alliances they built with part of the educated elite.
   Indeed, social and political tensions within the guild forced a two-way
   split within the guild and its elites. These findings definitively call
   into question the traditional view of the cohesiveness of the butchers'
   guilds in medieval Europe and their supposed marginalization in medieval
   society, advancing understanding of fourteenth-century Siena, of its
   enduring popular regime and, more generally, of late medieval urban
   society, politics and revolts. Moreover, such a case study has the
   potential to enable further comparative analysis across medieval and
   early modern Europe.},

Abstract = {To contribute meaningfully to the fight against disease outbreaks, the
   media should not just funnel predetermined health news to the audience.
   It should also play the vital role of convincing citizens to protect
   themselves and to shun rumors, misinformation and conspiracy theories
   that disfigure reality about infectious diseases. The present study
   examines alleged Covid-19 information concealment in Nigeria, which is
   thought to account for citizen uncooperativeness in the fight against
   the disease. It highlights the distinctions between data privacy and
   information secrecy. Using Spearman's rank correlation, Chi-square and
   linear regression, we analyzed data from 183 statistically selected
   respondents from two states and the Federal Capital Territory in
   Nigeria. Data were also generated from qualitative survey of 12 health
   editors, two public affairs analysts and two government officials.
   Results indicate negative relationships between compliance with Covid-19
   containment measures, citizen opinions on Covid-19 information
   protection and opinions on Covid-19 controversies. Data from qualitative
   survey suggest that government's protection of information forces
   editors to report stories without ``human face.{''} The study highlights
   the need for distinctions between physical privacy, information privacy
   and related concepts in the enforcement of health information privacy.
   This is to avoid sacrificing the public's right to know in the guise of
   health information protection.},

Abstract = {After being criticized for promoting misinformation in the 2016 US
   presidential election, Facebook announced a ``privacy-focused vision of
   social media. `` Purportedly to decrease misinformation on users'
   newsfeeds, these technical and rhetorical reforms moved users away from
   public-facing areas of the site, funneling them into private groups.
   Significantly, these reforms created groups organized around opinions
   increasingly disconnected from strangers' views. Consequently, these
   changes facilitated publicities that fostered QAnon conspiracies,
   militia group recruitment, and right-wing violence. To understand this
   dangerous radicalization, we make explicit that publics are dependent on
   the opinions-the doxa-that constitute them. In clarifying that publics
   are rooted in doxa, we reveal how sociotechnical
   assemblages-particularly private Facebook groups-are creating what we
   call adoxastic publics, or publics made up of adoxa: asocial and highly
   sheltered, improbable, and often disreputable opinions. Specifically, we
   explore how the affordances of Facebook's infrastructure divorce
   participants from encountering strange doxa, the heart of publics,
   instead promoting discursive stagnation and violent orientations towards
   others. These adoxastic affordances align with and embolden the
   rhetorical practices of masculine white nationalism and other dangerous
   ideologies. We conclude by offering the possibility of endoxastic
   networks as a productive correction to dangerous and anti-democratic
   adoxastic social media.},

Abstract = {Development of the COVID-19 vaccines unfolded in real-time, lending a
   sense that they were developed more rapidly than other vaccines.
   Long-term data on their safety and effectiveness is not yet available.
   Thus, people may have greater uncertainty about the COVID-19 vaccines
   than other vaccines. We know that people high in anxiety have greater
   intolerance of uncertainty (IUS) and may have greater fears of adverse
   effects and concerns about the vaccine failing to prevent COVID-19.
   Ultimately, people with anxiety disorders may have greater COVID-19
   vaccine hesitancy (VH). This study examined the degree of VH in people
   with (n = 96) and without (n = 52) anxiety disorders, whether anxiety
   status has an additive effect on factors known to predict hesitancy, and
   whether reasons for VH differed across groups. Groups did not differ in
   VH, but IUS was associated with greater hesitancy in those without
   anxiety but with less hesitancy in those with anxiety. Both groups'
   strongest predictors of hesitancy were influenza vaccine history,
   conspiracy beliefs, individualism, and trust. The top reasons for VH
   were concerns about adverse effects and efficacy, and the top reasons to
   get the vaccine were to protect others and self. Implications for
   reducing VH are discussed.},

Title = {Effect of Critical Thinking Education on Epistemically Unwarranted
   Beliefs in College Students},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The degree to which students hold epistemically unwarranted beliefs,
   beliefs not founded on reliable reasoning or credible data, can be used
   as a measure of critical thinking skills. To this end, college students
   (n = 806) were surveyed at the beginning and end of a semester.
   Epistemically unwarranted beliefs were pervasive. Several sections of a
   critical thinking class that specifically and directly addressed
   pseudoscience, taught by three different instructors, produced a large
   and significant reduction of those beliefs, but research methods classes
   and unrelated general education classes did not. Most likely to be
   reduced were beliefs in health pseudoscience and extraordinary life
   forms. Conspiracy theories were least likely to change. Demographic
   variables (gender, race, SES) were associated with beliefs at pre-test,
   but not related to reduction of belief as a result of the class.
   Similarly, academic indicators that suggest intelligence were related to
   belief at pre-test, but not change. The one exception was that reduction
   of belief in health pseudoscience was widespread in all groups at
   pre-test, but showed the greatest reduction among students with
   indicators of academic aptitude and achievement. We conclude that the
   educational approach of directly addressing pseudoscience is effective
   for changing beliefs, not just increasing knowledge, and that it works
   for most college students, not just a select subset.},

Abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a common respiratory
   disorder with devastating consequences for integrative body systems. A
   picture is emerging to illustrate wide-ranging deleterious consequences
   of disordered breathing during sleep for major homeostatic control
   systems, with considerable interest in cardiorespiratory and autonomic
   morbidity underpinning the development of hypertension. The vista is
   bleak when one also considers the link between OSAS and a host of other
   maladies. Exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), resulting from
   repeated obstructions of the pharyngeal airway, is a hallmark feature of
   OSAS that appears, in animal models, to drive the development and
   maintenance of several key morbidities. A growing body of evidence now
   points to aberrant respiratory plasticity at multiple levels following
   exposure to CIH. Herein, we review the experimental data revealing that
   CIH causes: respiratory muscle weakness and fatigue; impaired motor
   control of the upper airway; and, discordant respiratory rhythm and
   pattern generation. This multifaceted conspiracy creates the perfect
   storm with the potential to exacerbate OSAS serving to establish an
   inescapable cycle of respiratory morbidity. Several pharmacological
   interventions in animal models appear wholly effective in preventing the
   calamitous consequences of CIH and may have application as adjunctive
   therapies in the treatment of OSAS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Cognitive perspectives on SLA The Associative-Cognitive CREED},
Journal = {AILA REVIEW},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {100-121},
Abstract = {This paper outlines current cognitive perspectives on second language
   acquisition (SLA). The Associative-Cognitive CREED holds that SLA is
   governed by the same principles of associative and cognitive learning
   that underpin the rest of human knowledge. The major principles of the
   framework are that SLA is Construction- based, Rational,
   Exemplar-driven, Emergent, and Dialectic. Language learning involves the
   acquisition of constructions that map linguistic form and function.
   Competence and performance both emerge from the dynamic system that is
   the frequency-tuned conspiracy of memorized exemplars of use of these
   constructions, with competence being the integrated sum of prior usage
   and performance being its dynamic contextualized activation. The system
   is rational in that it optimally reflects prior first language (L1)
   usage. The L1 tunes the ways in which learners attend to language.
   Learned-attention transfers to L2 and it is this L1 entrenchment that
   limits the endstate of usage-based SLA. But these limitations can be
   overcome by recruiting learner consciousness, putting them into a
   dialectic tension between the conflicting forces of their current stable
   states of interlanguage and the evidence of explicit form-focused
   feedback, either linguistic, pragmatic, or metalinguistic, that allows
   socially scaffolded development. The paper directs the reader to recent
   review articles in these key areas and weighs the implications of this
   framework.},

Title = {Imperial Gothic 2.0: Brexit, Brex-Lit, and everyday Euroscepticism in
   British popular culture},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 21},
Abstract = {In recent years, scholarship on postfunctionalism in European
   integration has drawn attention to how processes of Europeanisation are
   not restricted to policymakers, but exist equally (if not more
   significantly) in the quotidian. The 2016-2020 Brexit process and
   debates on the relationship between national identity and `Europeanness'
   urge a new consideration of how Europeanisation is narrated in everyday
   discourses. This paper analyses British fictional portrayals of the EEC
   and EU and posits a new theoretical framework of `Imperial Gothic 2.0'.
   Pre-2016 representations of the EU were entirely dystopian. But
   post-2016, Brex-Lit fiction has reversed this trend and the EU now
   appears as a flawless utopia. Early twentiethcentury `Imperial Gothic'
   saw popular fiction defined by themes of British decline and oppression
   by foreign powers; a century later, Brex-Lit has resurrected these
   themes by narrating Britain in terminal decline, reflecting cultural
   anxieties, a reversal of Self and Other, and a loss of identities. This
   `Imperial Gothic 2.0' reveals anxieties which reflect and influence
   political action, and reveals the extent to which imaginations and
   narratives of the EU have transformed from depictions of a distant,
   technocratic entity used for comedy or conspiracy, into a site of
   intense emotional affiliation, nostalgia, anticipation, and regret.},

   vaccine types},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {Many countries have secured larger quantities of COVID-19 vaccines than
   their population is willing to take. The abundance and the large variety
   of vaccines created not only an unprecedented intensity of vaccine
   related public discourse, but also a historical moment to understand
   vaccine hesitancy better. Yet, the heterogeneity of hesitancy by vaccine
   types has been neglected in the existing literature so far. We address
   this problem by analysing the acceptance and the assessment of five
   vaccine types. We use information collected with a nationally
   representative survey at the end of the third wave of the COVID-19
   pandemic in Hungary. During the vaccination campaign, individuals could
   reject the assigned vaccine to wait for a more preferred alternative
   that enables us to quantify revealed preferences across vaccine types.
   We find that hesitancy is heterogenous by vaccine types and is driven by
   individuals' trusted source of information. Believers of conspiracy
   theories are more likely to evaluate the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and
   Moderna) unacceptable. Those who follow the advice of politicians are
   more likely to evaluate vector-based (AstraZeneca and Sputnik) or
   whole-virus vaccines (Sinopharm) acceptable. We argue that the greater
   selection of available vaccine types and the free choice of the
   individual are desirable conditions to increase the vaccination rate in
   societies.},

Abstract = {In the age of the Internet, people have increased access to information
   along multiple dimensions. It might seem that we are on our way to an
   epistemic utopia in which we spend less time and effort on basic
   cognitive tasks while devoting more time and effort to complex
   deliberation. However, though there are many accurate sources on the
   Internet, they must be sifted from the spammers, concern trolls,
   practical jokers, conspiracy theorists, counterintelligence
   sock-puppets, and outright liars who also proliferate online. We can
   approach this problem via the individual or via the network, asking two
   questions. First, holding the topology of the network constant, which
   moral and epistemic dispositions (e.g., trust, distrust, skepticism,
   curiosity) are conducive to successful inquiry by nodes at different
   positions within it? Second, holding the distribution of people's
   epistemic dispositions constant, which network topologies are more
   likely to produce epistemic goods and avoid epistemic ills? To answer
   these questions, we need to combine virtue-theoretic reflection on
   individual dispositions with a nuanced understanding of the dynamics of
   networks. In this paper, I highlight and explore some important
   properties of such networks and connect those properties with
   dispositions that make someone an excellent member of an epistemic
   network.},

Abstract = {The virtual enterprise (VE) is a new collaborative intelligent
   manufacturing paradigm that pools the core competencies of its member
   enterprises through computer networks to exploit transient market
   opportunities. The successful operation of such an organization is
   strongly dependent on its information securities, in which cross-domain
   authentication among entities of different member enterprises is a
   crucial issue. This problem is particularly difficult in VEs because of
   their collaborative nature in terms of agility, market dynamics, low
   cost, and diversity of collaboration modes. In this paper, we put
   forward a novel virtual bridge certificate authority (BCA) trust model,
   based on which an efficient cross-domain authentication scheme is
   further presented. The proposed scheme is implemented by the distributed
   verifiable secret sharing protocol and the threshold elliptic curve
   cryptosystem signature algorithm. It has the same advantages of simple
   construction and short length of inter-enterprise certification paths as
   the BCA model but does not need to create and maintain a dedicated
   physical BCA. In addition, the proposed scheme has the merits of high
   bit security, high efficiency, low cost, conspiracy attack resistance,
   and adaptability to diverse collaboration modes of VE. Therefore, the
   scheme is suitable for cross-domain authentications in VEs, especially
   for resource-limited applications. Copyright (C) 2014 JohnWiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {After World War II various texts came out that claimed that there was a
   conspiracy for the creation of the Fourth Reich in Latin America. The
   fact that many people involved with Nazism had escaped the Nuremberg
   tribunal and sought refuge in Latin American countries occasioned the
   appearance of fanciful and fantastic stories about their alleged covert
   activities aimed at reorganizing the Nazi Party on the continent. One
   such story referred to the Brazilian towns of Marechal Candido Rondon
   and Rio do Sul. According to an accusation made by ``agent{''} Erich
   Erdstein, these towns sheltered Nazi war criminals Josef Mengele and
   Martin Bormann and the Fourth Reich would be created in them. These
   accusations can be found in literary works and reports of newspapers and
   magazines, which, although different in genre, emphasize secret
   meetings, hidden Nazi bases in the jungle, persecutions and adventures a
   la Sherlock Holmes and James Bond, the survival of Hitler, the creation
   of the Fourth Reich on this continent and others. Thus, the article
   analyzes the discourses about these towns, understanding them as part of
   an imaginary formed after the war according to which the Fourth Reich
   could arise anywhere in the world, especially in Latin America.},

Abstract = {Oncological treatment is focused primarily on the biological control of
   the disease. Responses to patients' cognitive and emotional needs are,
   in general, satisied under pressing time limits, paternalistic
   benefactor conditions and vertical relationships. The pharmaceutical
   industry has played an important role in cancer patient education;
   however, this clearly presents a conlict of interest. In order to meet
   the challenge of providing patient education, the National Cancer
   Institute (NCI) approved the creation of a communicative educational
   program. This article describes how a pedagogical proposal based upon
   the recognition of subjectivity, social interaction, autonomy, and
   empowerment was implemented. Over a 10-month period 1,200 patients
   participated; 48\% of whom had only primary level education. The outcome
   included the satisfying of cognitive and emotional needs; overcoming the
   conspiracy of silence; promoting treatment adherence; deliberation about
   sexuality, amenorrhea and the risk of pregnancy in women undergoing
   treatment; informed consent as an opportunity for communication; and,
   orientation on how to access pertinent organizations. The education
   center ofers support services which encourage self-awareness and
   empowerment, and brings together peers who are facing the uncertainties
   of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Communicative education reinforces
   and provides feedback on events that take place in a clinical setting.},

Abstract = {This paper studies how Emerson's `Self-Reliance' offers a meaningful
   account of political and moral self-education in Western democracies.
   Emerson's moral perfectionism involves an ethical, political and
   democratic individualism that needs to be reconsidered. This paper
   explores a perfectionist interpretation of the modern forms of
   self-education as political and ordinary practices, first with the case
   of conspiracy theories, which express an individual desire for
   self-education but appear as the result of a lack of self-reliance and a
   failure of political self-education, and then through the explicit claim
   to self-education made by activists in ecological, anti-racial or
   feminist organisations, which embodies the democratic need for
   self-reliance. These two examples reveal a new kind of efficient and
   ordinary political power at the edge of civic commitment. This leads us
   to define an alternative conception of pedagogy, in which equality in
   self-reliance matters. This also underlines our moral and ordinary
   political responsibility and challenges the traditional philosophical
   opposition between personal and public, subjective and universal. This
   paper underlines the accuracy of Stanley Cavell's interpretation of
   Emerson's `Self-Reliance' in order to provide a perfectionist
   interpretation of activism. It also opens a new crossed perspective
   between the French and American approaches.},

   vaccines. However, COVID-19 vaccine uptake may be impeded by beliefs
   based on misinformation. We sought to understand the prevalence and
   nature of misbeliefs about COVID-19 vaccines, and identify associated
   factors, shortly after commencement of Australia's national vaccine
   rollout. A cross-sectional survey was administered to unvaccinated young
   adults (n = 2050) in Australia aged 18-49 years (mean age 33 years), 13
   July-21 August 2021. This sample was previously under-represented in
   COVID-19 research but shown to have less willingness to vaccinate. Two
   thirds of participants agreed with at least one misbelief item.
   Misperceptions about COVID-19 vaccines were found to be significantly
   associated with lower health literacy, less knowledge about vaccines,
   lower perceived personal risk of COVID-19, greater endorsement of
   conspiracy beliefs, and lower confidence and trust in government and
   scientific institutions. Misbeliefs were more common in participants
   with less educational attainment, in younger age groups, and in males,
   as per previous research. Understanding determinants and barriers to
   vaccination uptake, such as knowledge and beliefs based on
   misinformation, can help to shape effective public health communication
   and inform debunking efforts at this critical time and in the future.},

Abstract = {The Coronavirus pandemic has triggered an authentic infodemic, which is
   a global epidemic of disinformation that has spread throughout most of
   the world. Social media platforms and pseudo-media outlets have
   contributed to the problem by producing and disseminating misleading
   content that is potentially dangerous to public health. This research
   focuses on a rather unknown phenomenon, which involves digital sites
   that mimic the appearance of news media but provide pseudo-information.
   Five Spanish pseudo-media have been analyzed with the aim of enhancing
   understanding of the issues and the frames presented. The results show
   clear links with the far-right ideology as well as the presence of a
   populist, polarized discourse through the use of belligerent, offensive
   expressions to refer to institutions and their representatives. Politics
   is the main issue represented, with a frame that clearly points out the
   incompetence and cynicism of the Spanish government. Conspiracy theories
   associate the origins of the pandemic to a Chinese laboratory and
   emphasize a global plan to establish systemic control. Measures to stop
   the virus are framed as harmful and ineffective, linked to a euthanasia
   scheme targeted at older people, especially regarding vaccination, which
   is presented as a solution offered for economic interests.},

Abstract = {Recent statistics show that almost 1/4 of a million people have died and
   four million people are affected either with mild or serious health
   problems caused by coronavirus (COVID-19). These numbers are rapidly
   increasing (World Health Organization, May 3, 2020c). There is much
   concern during this pandemic about the spread of misleading or
   inaccurate information. This article reports on a small study which
   attempted to identify the types and sources of COVID-19 misinformation.
   The authors identified and analysed 1225 pieces of COVID-19 fake news
   stories taken from fact-checkers, myth-busters and COVID-19 dashboards.
   The study is significant given the concern raised by the WHO
   Director-General that `we are not just fighting the pandemic, we are
   also fighting infodemic'. The study concludes that the COVID-19
   infodemic is full of false claims, half backed conspiracy theories and
   pseudoscientific therapies, regarding the diagnosis, treatment,
   prevention, origin and spread of the virus. Fake news is pervasive in
   social media, putting public health at risk. The scale of the crisis and
   ubiquity of the misleading information require that scientists, health
   information professionals and journalists exercise their professional
   responsibility to help the general public identify fake news stories.
   They should ensure that accurate information is published and
   disseminated.},

Abstract = {Aim: To increase understanding of the consequences of growing up with
   substance-abusing parents, including how this can influence the
   experience of becoming a parent. Methods: In-depth interviews were
   conducted with 19 parents who had participated in an Infant and Toddler
   Psychiatry Unit intervention programme and who had experienced
   substance-abusing parents in their family of origin. Directed
   qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data. Results:
   Analysis of the interview material revealed both a high incidence of
   parentification and a conspiracy of silence concerning the substance
   abuse that helped generate symptoms of cognitive dissonance in the
   children. As parents they experience a high degree of inadequacy,
   incompetence and stress. Conclusion: A majority of the children who had
   grown up with substance-abusing parents responded by taking a parenting
   role for themselves, their siblings and their parents. These children,
   often well-behaved and seemingly competent, need to be identified and
   offered support as they risk developing significant psychological and
   emotional difficulties that can extend into adulthood. They form an
   extra sensitive group who may need special support up to and including
   the time when they become parents themselves. This finding underlines
   the importance of further research on parenting among those who have
   grown up with abusive parents.},

Abstract = {The Law of Cooperatives, a series of groundbreaking economic reforms,
   was passed as part of perestroika and glasnost in Gorbachev's Soviet
   Union. In a tense exchange, CBS news anchor Dan Rather challenged Vice
   President George H. W. Bush about the part he played in the Iran-Contra
   Affair; later that year, indictments of conspiracy to defraud the United
   States were issued for Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North and Vice Admiral
   John Poindexter. The Liberal Democrats formed as a new party in the
   United Kingdom. A precursor to revolution in eastern bloc nations in
   1989, the Candle Demonstration took place in Bratislava, followed a few
   months later by the Singing Revolution in Estonia. As part of the Geneva
   Accords, the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw from Afghanistan. Socialist
   Francois Mitterand was re-elected President of France. The 8888 ``People
   Power{''} uprising led to the death of thousands of demonstrating
   Burmese. War between Iran and Iraq ended. Osama bin Laden founded Al
   Qaeda. Climatologist James Hansen testified in front of Congress about
   man-made global warming, in an attempt to draw awareness to what he saw
   as an urgent issue. There were riots in Algiers and a plebiscite held
   for Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet resulted in a decisive ``no{''}
   vote against his continued rule.},

Title = {Cryptanalysis and Performance Evaluation of Enhanced Threshold Proxy
   Signature Scheme Based on RSA for Known Signers},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {In these days there are plenty of signature schemes such as the (t, n)
   threshold proxy signature scheme (Kumar and Verma 2010). The network is
   a shared medium so that the weakness security attacks such as
   eavesdropping, replay attack, and modification attack. Thus, we have to
   establish a common key for encrypting/decrypting our communications over
   an insecure network. In this scheme, a (t, n) threshold proxy signature
   scheme based on RSA, any t or more proxy signers can cooperatively
   generate a proxy signature while t - 1 or fewer of them cannot do it.
   The threshold proxy signature scheme uses the RSA cryptosystem to
   generate the private and the public key of the signers (Rivest et al.,
   1978). Comparison is done on the basis of time complexity, space
   complexity, and communication overhead. We compare the performance of
   four schemes (Hwang et al. (2003), Kuo and Chen (2005), Yong-Jun et al.
   (2007), and Li et al. (2007), with the performance of a scheme that has
   been proposed earlier by the authors of this paper. In the proposed
   scheme, both the combiner and the secret share holder can verify the
   correctness of the information that they are receiving from each other.
   Therefore, the enhanced threshold proxy signature scheme is secure and
   efficient against notorious conspiracy attacks.},

Abstract = {The correlation between the CP asymmetry in B --> (S-phiKs) and the
   chromoelectric dipole moment (CEDM) of strange quark (d(s)(C)), which is
   constrained by the electric dipole moment (EDM) of Hg-199, is studied in
   the supersymmetric (SUSY) models with the right-handed squark mixing. It
   is known that, if the right-handed bottom and strange squarks have a
   CP-violating mixing, such as in the SUSY SU(5) GUT with right-handed
   neutrinos, the induced gluon penguin diagram may give a sizable
   contribution to S-phiKs. However, when the left-handed bottom and
   strange squarks also have a mixing, the conspiracy of the left and
   right-handed squarks may lead to a sizable d(s)(C), which is enhanced by
   m(b)/m(s). While the estimate for the EDM of Hg-199, induced by d(s)(C),
   might have large uncertainties due to the hadron and nuclear dynamics,
   the current bound implies the gluon penguin contribution by the
   right-handed squarks to S-phiKs should be suppressed and the deviation
   Of S-phiKs from the Standard Model may not be so large. Also, we discuss
   the constraint from the EDM of 199Hg in the SUSY SU(5) GUT with the
   right-handed neutrinos. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {AACSB's failures in guarding the ethical henhouse of business schools},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT LEARNING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 31},
Abstract = {This essay is written to provoke a reaction against the Association to
   Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. When a business school's
   administration is criminally convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud and
   yet it retains its accreditations, something is wrong. Accreditors
   expect that we enforce ethical standards like ``no cheating{''} on our
   students but do not enforce those standards on deans, even in cases of
   publicly-admitted years-long submissions of misrepresentative rankings
   data. That inconsistency is not lost on us, given the explicit
   statements such accreditors have about quality, social responsibility,
   and serving students-all of which are violated in their inactions when
   their paying members (or their graduates) are involved in harmful
   behaviors. Management learning is negatively affected as a result;
   whatever we state in the classroom about ethics is effectively drowned
   out by what standards are actually enforced in the real world by those
   who claim to provide legitimacy to our programs and give us a license to
   operate. So, it is time to address that. An implementable solution is
   proposed, one which if not adopted should lead to serious consideration
   of the dissolution of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of
   Business and any other accreditor who fails to provide the public
   service expected of it.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to analyze the access, action and
   reaction of young people, adults and older adults as relevant aspects of
   the infodemic. Given this, a quantitative, observational,
   cross-analytical study was carried out. The sample was of 503 people
   between the ages of 20 and 70 in Lima, Peru: young people (28.0\%),
   adults (59.4\%) and older adults (12.5\%); 44.0\% men and 56.0\% women.
   The evaluation instrument was a survey composed of 12 items showing
   evidence of validity. The results showed that young people and adults
   make greater use of Facebook for information, while older adults use
   instant messaging (WhatsApp) for the same purpose. It is the older
   adults who maintain a tendency to share information without contrasting
   the veracity, unlike young people and adults. Young people are looking
   for trusted sources such as official websites, unlike adults and older
   adults. The effect of the infodemic causes emotional effects on a higher
   level in older adults. It is concluded that the infodemic causes a set
   of social phenomena that alters public health, generates anxiety, stress
   and depression that overflows in behaviors such as self-medication,
   search for alternative medicine and creation of conspiracy theories.},

Abstract = {Recent work has found that an individual's beliefs and personal
   characteristics can impact perceptions of and responses to the COVID-19
   pandemic. Certain individuals-such as those who are politically
   conservative or who endorse conspiracy theories-are less likely to
   engage in preventative behaviors like social distancing. The current
   research aims to address whether these individual differences not only
   affect people's reactions to the pandemic, but also their actual
   likelihood of contracting COVID-19. In the early months of the pandemic,
   U.S. participants responded to a variety of individual difference
   measures as well as questions specific to the pandemic itself. Four
   months later, 2120 of these participants responded with whether they had
   contracted COVID-19. Nearly all of our included individual difference
   measures significantly predicted whether a person reported testing
   positive for the virus in this four-month period. Additional analyses
   revealed that all of these relationships were primarily mediated by
   whether participants held accurate knowledge about COVID-19. These
   findings offer useful insights for developing more effective
   interventions aimed at slowing the spread of both COVID-19 and future
   diseases. Moreover, some findings offer critical tests of the validity
   of such theoretical frameworks as those concerning conspiratorial
   ideation and disgust sensitivity within a real-world context.},

Abstract = {Influenza epidemics happen every year, with more than 8 million severe
   cases in 2017. The most effective way to prevent seasonal influenza is
   vaccination. In recent years, misinformation regarding vaccines abounds
   on social media, but the flu vaccine is relatively understudied in this
   area, and the current study is the first 1 to explore the content and
   nature of influenza information that is shared on Twitter, comparing
   tweets published in the early flu season with those posted in peak flu
   season. Using a quantitative content analysis, 1000 tweets from both
   parts of the flu season were analyzed for use of Health Belief Model
   (HBM) variables, engagement, and flu vaccine specific variables.
   Findings show several promising opportunities for health organizations
   and professionals: HBM constructs were present more frequently than in
   previous, related studies, and fewer vaccine-hesitant tweets appear to
   be present. However, the presence of high barriers to flu vaccine uptake
   increased significantly from early to peak season, including an increase
   in the mention of conspiracy theories. Flu vaccine related tweets appear
   to vary in misinformation level and density throughout the flu season.
   While this should be confirmed by further studies over multiple flu
   seasons, this a finding that should be considered by public health
   organizations when developing flu vaccine campaigns on social media.},

Abstract = {Background: The importance of social networking sites (SNSs) as
   platforms to engage in the correction of fake news has been documented
   widely. More evidence is needed to understand the popularity of
   health-related rumors and how Health Educators can optimize their use of
   SNSs. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the spread of
   health rumors and verified information on SNSs using the Zika virus as a
   case study. Methods: A content analysis of Zika-related news stories on
   SNSs between February 2016 and January 2017 was conducted to verify
   accuracy (phase 1). Phase 1 was followed by an analysis of volume of
   shares (phase 2) and a thematic analysis of headlines (phase 3).
   Results: Rumors had three times more shares than verified stories.
   Popular rumors portray Zika as a conspiracy against the public and a
   low-risk issue and connect it to the use of pesticides. Discussion: This
   study identifies the value of integrating in-depth analysis of popular
   health-related rumors into the development of communication strategies.
   Translation to Health Education Practice: Misinformation on SNSs can
   hinder disease prevention efforts. This study shows how information
   circulating on SNSs can be analyzed from a quantitative and qualitative
   standpoint to help Health Educators maximize the use of online
   communication platforms.},

Title = {The Shakespeare Authorship Debate Revisited},
Journal = {LITERATURE COMPASS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {618-632},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Who wrote Shakespeare? And does it matter? Since Delia Bacon's
   researches in the mid-nineteenth century, writers have questioned
   whether Shakespeare of Stratford really did write the works attributed
   to him, and proposed numerous alternative authors including Francis
   Bacon, the Earl of Oxford and Christopher Marlowe. This article does not
   endorse this scepticism, but instead treats the sceptical phenomenon as
   a wayward contribution to Shakespearean studies, discussing the history
   and methodology of these anti-Stratfordian claims, to assess their hold
   on generations of interested amateurs including Henry James, Nathaniel
   Hawthorne and Sigmund Freud. The authorship debate is conceptualised
   according to different paradigms: as a conspiracy theory, as a reaction
   against the growing professionalisation of literary studies within
   universities, and as a version of the child's wish for more glamorous
   parents, theorised by Freud in `Family Romances'. Its ideological force
   - both socially conservative - a nobleman must have written the plays -
   and hermeneutically radical - their messages are potentially dangerous
   so require the utmost secrecy - is discussed. Finally I relate the
   authorship debate to recent critical analyses of Shakespearean
   collaborations with other authors, and suggest that this is the
   direction in which its probing energies might most usefully be taken in
   future.},

Title = {White Racial Identity and Its Link to Support for Far-Right Groups: A
   Test of a Social Psychological Model},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Prior research indicates that far-right political groups tend to be
   disproportionately composed of and supported by white people. Drawing
   off the group identity and developmental literature, we add theoretical
   clarity to this relationship. We argue that a salient white racial
   identity motivates people to explore social contexts that affirm the
   value of being white. Many of these contexts (e.g., conservative media)
   reinforce and instill beliefs in conspiracies, perceptions of racial
   threat, and a legitimization of group hierarchies, which are defining
   features of far-right ideologies. As people develop a strong white
   racial identity, they should thus view far-right groups more favorably.
   Drawing off survey data from a national US sample of 903 white young
   adults, we tested a mediation model positing that the effects of a
   strong white racial identity with support for four far-right groups (the
   January 6 protesters, QAnon, the Proud Boys, and the Oath Keepers) would
   be mediated by enhanced levels of conspiratorial ideation, perceived
   racial threat, and social dominance orientation. We found that the
   effects of white racial identity with support for all four groups were
   mostly or completely accounted for by these three mediating factors. We
   discuss the implications of this research for the racial identity and
   far-right groups literatures.},

Journal = {VACCINES},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 vaccination has been the subject of unprecedented
   misinformation, false news, and public concerns. This study presents a
   unique analysis comprising persons who were not vaccinated and became
   ill. It investigates reasons for not vaccinating and evaluates how the
   personal experience of COVID-19 affected further attitudes and decisions
   related to health. The study included 730 consecutive unvaccinated
   patients hospitalized in 12 centers in Poland during the autumn 2021
   pandemic wave. The most frequent reason behind the refusal to receive
   the vaccine was concern over the adverse effects, disbelief that the
   vaccine was sufficiently tested, and one's conviction that COVID-19 will
   not affect a patient. Online information, friends, spouse,
   children/grandchildren, and other family members were most often the
   source of discouragement from vaccination. Most individuals regretted
   their decision not to receive a vaccine (66.0\%), declared to promote
   COVID-19 vaccination after discharge (64.0\%), and to receive a COVID-19
   vaccine in the time recommended for convalescents (69.5\%). Individuals
   expressing no regrets of vaccine refusal more frequently revealed
   conspiracy beliefs. The study shows that personal experience with severe
   COVID-19 can influence the perception of vaccination, but approximately
   one-third of unvaccinated hospitalized patients still appear to express
   vaccine hesitancy.},

   Exposure Study},

Abstract = {Background: Social media platforms such as YouTube are hotbeds for the
   spread of misinformation about vaccines.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore how individuals are
   exposed to antivaccine misinformation on YouTube based on whether they
   start their viewing from a keyword-based search or from antivaccine seed
   videos.
   Methods: Four networks of videos based on YouTube recommendations were
   collected in November 2019. Two search networks were created from
   provaccine and antivaccine keywords to resemble goal-oriented browsing.
   Two seed networks were constructed from conspiracy and antivaccine
   expert seed videos to resemble direct navigation. Video contents and
   network structures were analyzed using the network exposure model.
   Results: Viewers are more likely to encounter antivaccine videos through
   direct navigation starting from an antivaccine video than through
   goal-oriented browsing. In the two seed networks, provaccine videos,
   antivaccine videos, and videos containing health misinformation were all
   found to be more likely to lead to more antivaccine videos.
   Conclusions: YouTube has boosted the search rankings of provaccine
   videos to combat the influence of antivaccine information. However, when
   viewers are directed to antivaccine videos on YouTube from another site,
   the recommendation algorithm is still likely to expose them to
   additional antivaccine information.},

Abstract = {In this study, we analyze the correlation between trust in government
   and official information with individual compliance to recommended
   measures, and between attitudes to government measures and people's
   behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic. We identified a group of
   respondents who refused categorically to believe in the COVID-19
   pandemic in Russia -COVID-19 dissidents. They not only deny the pandemic
   but also refuse to comply with pandemic rules and restrictions. Then,
   based on seven national samples covering a combined total of 40,700
   people in all regions of Russia, we established a link between the level
   of distrust of the public sector and the level of COVID-19 dissidence by
   means of linear regression.
   We proved that COVID-19 dissidents do not trust official statistics and
   believe in low infection risks. They provide low evaluation of the
   medical aid quality which leads to underestimation of the risk of being
   infected and COVID-19 compliance rules. We recommend governments
   consider restoring citizens' trust as one of the priorities in fighting
   the pandemic, alongside battling misinformation that feeds conspiracy
   beliefs. The level of public trust in government decisions is a critical
   factor that speeds up mass vaccinations and contributes to a quick exit
   from the pandemic crisis.},

Abstract = {On April 4th, 1980, Puerto Rican artist Elizam Escobar was arrested
   along with other members of the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional
   (FALN) in Evanston, lllinois. All the members of the FALN claimed to be
   combatants in an anticolonial struggle against the US government and
   were found guilty of seditious conspiracy against the government of the
   United States in a series of trials in which none of them participated.
   Escobar's art, theory and criticism cannot be detached from the criminal
   proceedings brought against him, the consequences of which have also
   been influential in Escobar's cultural production. In this essay, I will
   explore the relationship of art, law and politics in Elizam Escobar's La
   ficcion, a painting from 1992 in which the Puerto Rican artist imagines
   his own funeral taking place in US Supreme Court. I will argue that the
   figure of the enemy in Escobar's La ficcion, with its projection of the
   death of the juridical subject in all its undecidability, opens up the
   possibility of questioning the limits of art, politics, and law. As it
   invites us to consider the death of politics in connection to the figure
   of the enemy, Escobar's La ficcion unfolds as a spectral return of the
   political.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on providing answers to three basic research
   questions on the basis of political discourse in Croatia (which produces
   fear through the use of explicit and implicit speech of exclusion and
   often also hate speech) and research into marginalized groups personal
   narratives of fear and anxiety. First, how is hate narratively shaped in
   public discourse and personal narratives? Second, how does the language
   of hate affect those who are designated as objects of hate? Third, can
   and to what degree do the subjects of anxiety/fear the explicit object
   of hate) narrate their experience and emotional response to hate? The
   author is interested in the places in which hate (which is itself marked
   by silence) generates fear and silence, the places in which hate erodes
   the subjects' need for intersubjectivity and leads to a deep sense of
   isolation and being silent, and which also sometimes leads to
   articulated resistance.},

   States},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Healthcare workers (HCWs) need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 because
   they care for vulnerable patients. Hesitation to receiving the COVID-19
   vaccine stems from the argument of bodily autonomy, novel mRNA vaccine
   technology, and conspiracy theories. However, vaccinations may prevent
   thousands of hospitalizations and deaths. HCWs have previously complied
   with other required vaccinations to care for children, elderly, and
   immunocompromised patients. Yet, COVID-19 vaccination mandates in the
   healthcare setting have been faced with resistance and subsequent
   staffing shortages. As HCWs display their hesitation to the vaccine, the
   community loses trust in its efficacy and safety. Speculation on
   pharmaceutical profiteering has also contributed to vaccine mistrust. As
   the pandemic continues, the healthcare field must decide on a course of
   action: adhere to vaccination mandates and cope with decreased staffing,
   repeal vaccination mandates to recover staff, rely on personal
   protective equipment (PPE) alone for protection, or do nothing and
   expect survival through herd immunity. To date, the United States has
   chosen to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for any healthcare worker
   employed by Medicare and/or Medicaid-accepting facilities, allowing
   allergy and religious exemptions. This COVID-19 vaccination mandate for
   HCWs ethically protects the vulnerable people who HCWs vow to care for.},

Title = {Media and Responsibility for Their Effects: Instrumental vs.
   Environmental Views},
Journal = {LAWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {From the perspective of media ecology, this paper explores the question
   of responsibility for the effects that media have on society. To explain
   these media effects, two approaches are singled out. (1) The
   instrumental approach assumes that a medium works as a tool used by a
   user for a purpose. (2) The environmental approach focuses on the
   capacity of a medium to become an environmental force that reshapes both
   the habitat and the inhabitants. The instrumental approach to media,
   when taken too broadly and without an understanding of its limits, leads
   to conspiracy theories and inadequate social and political assessments.
   The more advanced and sophisticated environmental approach allows for an
   adequate understanding of media evolution and its effects but does not
   comply with the traditional legal notions of guilt and responsibility
   for actions, as there is no jurisdictional human or institutional agency
   when environmental forces are in play. After charting the distinction
   between the instrumental and environmental views of media, the paper
   focused on how the instrumental effects of media turn into environmental
   effects. The purpose of the paper is to develop and offer a media
   ecological apparatus for possible further juridical discussions
   regarding the regulation of the networking society.},

Abstract = {Denial of Islamophobia as a form of racism is widespread among French
   intellectual and political elites. Time and again it has been claimed in
   op-eds, talk shows, investigative journalistic work and even in
   full-length books devoted to the topic that the invocation of
   Islamophobia is part of an Islamist conspiracy to `silence legitimate
   criticism of Islam', and no less than a threat to `republican values'
   and laicite (laicism). Even anti-racist activists would want to see the
   term `banished', and academic dictionaries of racism see in it a tool of
   `blackmail' and `intimidation'. Though what I call `Islamophobia denial'
   can be observed across the western world, France is exceptional on two
   accounts: first, virulent denial is the most common mainstream posture
   on Islamophobia, transcending traditional political camps, whereas in
   other parts of the western world denial is more localized on the right
   and the far right. Second, the argumentative toolbox of Islamophobia
   denial, a consistent if problematic set of assertions and allegations to
   be found in all its global iterations, from the United States to
   Scandinavia, was developed in France and proceeds from the specific
   intellectual history of the `Muslim question' in that country. It is
   that history of origins, development and reception that this article
   sets out to analyse.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {748-764},
Abstract = {This article explores how `Zero Budget Natural Farming', an Indian
   natural farming movement centered on its founder and guru Subhash
   Palekar, enacts alternative agrarian worlds through the dual practices
   of critique and recuperation. Based on fieldwork among practitioners in
   the South Indian state of Kerala and on participation in teaching events
   held by Palekar, I describe the movement's critique of the agronomic
   mainstream (state extension services, agricultural universities, and
   scientists) and their recuperative practices of restoring small-scale
   cultivation based on Indian agroecological principles and biologies.
   Their critique combines familiar political-ecological arguments against
   productionism, and the injustices of the global food regime, with Hindu
   nationalist tropes highlighting Western conspiracies and corrupt
   science. For their recuperative work, these natural farmers draw, on one
   hand, on travelling agroecological technologies (fermentation, spacing,
   mulching, cow based farming) and current `probiotic', microbiological,
   and symbiotic understandings of soil and agriculture. On the other hand,
   they use Hindu nativist tropes, insisting on the exceptional properties
   of agrarian species native to, and belonging to India. I use the idea of
   ontological politics to describe the movement's performances as enacting
   an alternative rural world, in which humans, other-than-human animals,
   plants, mycorrhizae, and microbes are doing agriculture together.},

Abstract = {In the late 1860s and early 1870s the British colonial government in
   India suppressed an imagined Wahhabi conspiracy, which it portrayed as a
   profound threat to imperial security. The detention and trial of Amir
   and Hashmadad Khan-popularly known as the Great Wahhabi Case-was the
   most controversial of a series of public trials of suspected Wahhabis.
   The government justified extrajudicial arrests and detentions as being
   crucial to protect the empire from anti-colonial rebels inspired by
   fanatical religious beliefs. The government's case against the Khan
   brothers, however, was exceptionally weak. Their ongoing detention
   sparked a sustained public debate about the balance between executive
   authority and the rule of law. In newspapers and pamphlets published in
   India and Britain, Indian journalists and Anglo-Indian lawyers argued
   that arbitrary police powers posed a greater threat to public security
   than religious fanatics. In doing so, they embraced a language of
   liberalism which emphasized the rule of law and asserted the role of
   public opinion as a check on government despotism. Debates about the
   Great Wahhabi Case demonstrate the ongoing contest between authoritarian
   and liberal strands of imperial ideology, even at the height of the
   panic over the intertwined threat of Indian sedition and fanatical
   Islam.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered a tsunami of
   news, instructions, and precautionary measures related to the disease on
   social media platforms. Despite the considerable support on social
   media, a large number of fake propaganda and conspiracies are also
   circulated. People also reacted to COVID-19 vaccination on social media
   and expressed their opinions, perceptions, and conceptions. The present
   research work aims to explore the opinion dynamics of the general public
   about COVID-19 vaccination to help the administration authorities to
   devise policies to increase vaccination acceptance. For this purpose, a
   framework is proposed to perform sentiment analysis of COVID-19
   vaccination-related tweets. The influence of term frequency-inverse
   document frequency, bag of words (BoW), Word2Vec, and combination of
   TF-IDF and BoW are explored with classifiers including random forest,
   gradient boosting machine, extra tree classifier (ETC), logistic
   regression, Naive Bayes, stochastic gradient descent, multilayer
   perceptron, convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional encoder
   representations from transformers (BERT), long short-term memory (LSTM),
   and recurrent neural network (RNN). Results reveal that ETC outperforms
   using BoW with a 92\% of accuracy and is the most suitable approach for
   sentiment analysis of COVID-19-related tweets. Opinion dynamics show
   that sentiments in favor of vaccination have increased over time.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, Indonesia has been confronted with the growing
   influence of a radical Islamist movement that challenges the state
   doctrine (Pancasila), which was adopted in 1945, and demands a greater
   place for Islam, which is the religion of nearly 90 per cent of the
   population. The hardline groups wish to call into question the
   Indonesian state's pluralistic and inclusive religious identity, which
   they see as a conspiracy hatched by the Christian minority to deprive
   the Muslim majority of its ostensible rights. The Society of Jesus,
   which has been present in Java since the nineteenth century, is
   considered by Islamist critics as the main architect of this alleged
   plot. Furthermore, one of its members, Father Josephus Beek, is
   presented by Islamist radicals as one of the founders of the New Order
   (1966-1998), the regime led by General Suharto which was very hostile to
   political Islam in its early days. This article analyses how the Society
   of Jesus was able to integrate Catholicism into the Javanese spiritual
   landscape and explores the subsequent roles played by Jesuit leaders in
   the genesis and defence of Pancasila. It also sheds light on how
   Josephus Beek's very real manoeuvres have provided fodder for militant
   Islamist circles seeking to delegitimate Indonesia's secular status quo.},

Abstract = {The US government claims that US corporations lose billions of dollars
   worth of technological innovation each year to China. On average, the
   FBI opens a new China-related counterintelligence investigation every 12
   h. At present there are over 2000 such investigations underway. One such
   case focused on Yanjun Xu, an alleged officer in the Chinese MSS
   (Ministry of State Security) intelligence apparatus. He was accused of
   seeking to steal General Electric/Aviation jet engine technology. A
   unique feature of his case is that it he allegedly did so without ever
   setting foot in the USA. During the course of the investigation, the FBI
   was able to lure Xu to Belgium in 2018 and he was extradited to the USA
   after being apprehended by the Belgium authorities. In October, 2021 he
   was convicted of two counts of conspiring and attempting to commit
   economic espionage. Xu was also convicted of conspiracy to commit trade
   secret theft and two counts of attempted theft of trade secrets. He was
   defended by the Taft Law Firm in Cincinnati, Ohio. The author was hired
   by the Taft Law Firm to serve as a litigation consultant in the case and
   this affords him the opportunity to share relevant cultural variables
   associated with the case without revelation of confidential information.},

Abstract = {Following World War II, borders were being redrawn and there was a
   renewed geopolitical interest around the world in Antarctica as a
   strategic outpost. The writings of Miguel Serrano, an avowed Nazi,
   detailing his participation in the Chilean government's 1947 expedition
   to ``confirm sovereignty{''} (Pinochet de la Barra 39) in Antarctica
   (particularly 1957's Quien llama en los hielos) helped lend the
   continent the symbolic significance that it continues to hold for many
   today. Serrano introduces the Antarctic landscape as an aestheticized
   metaphor for Chile's imagined racial purity and its pretensions at
   nationalist, geopolitical domination, while also figuring it as a source
   of mythologized, occult-based images and conspiracy theories. This essay
   engages with these aspects of Serrano's work on Antarctica, and then
   moves on to a series of subsequent cultural artifacts that demonstrate
   how Antarctic ice is also a motif through which some Chileans have
   critiqued the legacy of fascism. This essay thus contends that Serrano's
   work on Antarctica is a key, yet under-examined, piece of a Chilean
   archive of fascist (and anti-fascist) aesthetics, connecting white
   supremacist texts written after the War of the Pacific to the
   geopolitical obsessions of the Pinochet regime and the memory struggles
   of the postdictatorship period.},

Abstract = {This paper reads Herman Melville's `Benito Cereno' as a response to
   antebellum anti-Catholic fiction. Focusing on Rosamond Culbertson's
   captivity narrative and its editor Samuel B. Smith's remarks in his
   magazine The Downfall of Babylon, I argue that through Delano, Melville
   ventriloquizes the sensationalist argument that because American
   Catholics were part of a Roman conspiracy to undermine Anglo-American
   liberties and place the U.S. government under the pope's control, it was
   necessary to suppress Catholic religious liberty. Melville uses an
   ironic narrative structure to probe the blindspots and overconfidence of
   Delano's Protestant liberal subjectivity, which reflects Smith's similar
   certainty. Smith understood the capacity for participation in a liberal
   democracy as a trait inhering in Protestant identities. Here, race and
   religion are entangled; for Smith and Delano, Protestant liberal
   subjectivity is a peculiarly Anglo-American identity. Liberalism,
   moreover, is for them a rhetorical tool for justifying the exploitation
   and marginalisation of minority individuals. Melville interrogates
   liberalism as a cultural formation meant to justify the exclusion of
   those who, like Catholics, were thought to be incapable of participating
   in a liberal democracy. He suggests that readers must develop a detached
   attitude to better negotiate the challenges of difference in society.},

Abstract = {In the decades leading to the Civil War, the United States and Great
   Britain faced a number of diplomatic crises, during which southern
   politicians often became alarmed at the prospect of British soldiers
   invading the southern coastline. The perceived threat was part of a
   wider southern paranoia over Britain's role in what was seen as a
   conspiracy to demolish the southern American system of slavery for
   Britain's ultimate economic gain. The alarm over an imagined British
   invasion was exacerbated by the fact that the anticipated invaders were
   free black men, the West India Regiments, stationed in the British West
   Indies. The tone of this paranoia was shaped by the memory of black
   participation in the War of 1812 and the fear that slaves would flee to
   British lines in any future conflict. An analysis of the discourse about
   these men in the southern press tells us much about the fears of
   southern slaveholders with regard to the trustworthiness of their own
   slaves and the ever-present threat of slave rebellion. Ultimately, the
   fears expressed about a disciplined black army led by an abolitionist
   imperial power reveal the true nature of southern anxiety over the
   stability of the South's own form of white supremacy.},

Abstract = {This study article focuses on American far-right (FR) extremists who
   committed ideologically motivated violent or financial crimes in the
   United States. We examine three research questions. First, are certain
   types of FR ideological beliefs associated with different types of
   criminal behavior? Second, can the various indicators of FR ideology be
   used to create a scalar measure of commitment to FR ideology? Third,
   which typology of the FR movement provides the most reliable measure of
   FR extremism? We use data from the United States Extremist Crime
   Database to measure indicators of FR ideology in a sample of 305 FRs who
   committed a financial crime or homicide between 2006 and 2010 in the
   United States. Conspiratorial, antigovernment, and antitax beliefs were
   positively associated with risk of financial crimes, while xenophobic,
   survivalist, and anti-gun control beliefs were positively associated
   with risk of violent crimes. A factor analysis created a commitment to
   FR ideology scale and identified four sub-types of FRs: Conspiracy
   Theorist, Survivalist, Movement Participant, and Proud far-rightist. The
   factor analysis did not support the prevailing typologies. Importantly
   though, these typologies were useful in predicting criminal behavior
   patterns of far rightists. We outline a number of other measurement
   issues for future research to address.},

Abstract = {This is the second in a series of five articles focusing on how Bernard
   Madoff's confidence game (con game) worked. This paper examines the
   activities of a handful of employees who were engaged backstage, hidden
   from government regulators and most investors, to further Madoff's
   crime. Their work revolved around the pretense that securities were
   being bought and sold. All these fairly well-paid accomplices pled
   guilty to being involved in criminal activities, although only one
   acknowledged that he knew he was part of a Ponzi scheme. Regardless of
   how they describe or label their activities, Madoff's back office had
   evolved into an organized gang of criminals.},

Abstract = {Several publications on the concept and structure of SARS-CoV-2 and
   COVID-19 over the past three years target medical and biomedical
   scientists, and rightly so, as experts in search of solutions made
   efforts to understand the molecular structure of the coronavirus. The
   multidisciplinary audience who needs help understanding the scientific
   discourse and the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 is left to guess in the dark.
   Studies show that a lack of proper understanding of the pandemic can
   have several consequences, including accepting conspiracy theories,
   misinformation, negative attitudes against public health safety
   measures, and the COVID-19 vaccine hesitation. This study uses metadata
   extracted from published documents on the concepts and structure of
   COVID-19 indexed on the Web of Science between 2020 to 2021 to create an
   abstract visual metaphor about the pandemic. Based on the cognitive
   connection theory, we develop a model and visualization that explains
   the conceptual structure of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 for the
   non-biomedical multidisciplinary audience. The visual analytics
   highlights the concepts, characteristics, and interrelationships on a
   network map, connecting some past viral/coronavirus pandemics and
   epidemics, particularly H1N1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. The conceptual
   model and visualization generate insight and understanding of the
   ongoing pandemic for multidisciplinary audiences.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the reaction of the Rus-sian press to the
   revolutionary events in Southern Italy in 1820-1821. The main sources
   were the journals ``Vestnik Evropy{''}, ``Nevsky Spectator{''}, ``Son of
   the Fatherland{''}, and the official newspaper ``St. Petersburg
   Vedomosti{''}, and the foreign press was also involved. In the course of
   the study, the main methods of conveying information to the reading
   public in Russia on such issues as the development of the revolutionary
   process in Naples, the reaction of the powers of the Holy Alliance, the
   role of the Carbonari society and the significance of the separatist
   movement in Sicily were established. It was possible to correct the
   conclusions of scientists of the USSR regarding the presentation of the
   news agenda in journals close to the Decembrist circles. The novelty of
   the study is seen in the fact that the prevailing influence of the
   Austrian press on the Russian press was established; the latter imported
   views on the constitutional process in Naples as the result of a
   conspiracy by the ``sect{''} of the Carbonari. Materials were
   established that stood out from the prevailing agenda and considered the
   events of the Nea-politan Revolution of 1820 from the point of view of
   political economy.},

Abstract = {During the coronavirus pandemic, conspiracy theories and dubious health
   guidance about COVID-19 led to public debates about the role and impact
   of blatant acts of disinformation. But less attention has been paid to
   the broader media environment, which is how most people understood the
   crisis and how it was handled by different governments. Drawing on a
   news diary study of 200 participants during the pandemic, we found they
   easily identified examples of ``fake news{''} but were less aware of
   relevant facts that might help them understand how the UK government
   managed the crisis. Our content analysis of 1259 television news items
   revealed broadcasters did not routinely draw on statistics to
   contextualise the UK's record of managing the coronavirus or regularly
   make comparisons with other countries. Given television news bulletins
   were the dominant news source for many people in the UK, we suggest the
   information environment gave audiences limited opportunities to
   understand the government's performance internationally. We argue that
   misinformation is often a symptom of editorial choices in media
   coverage-including television news produced by public service
   broadcasters-that can lead to gaps in public knowledge. We conclude by
   suggesting the concept of the information environment should play a more
   prominent role in studies that explore the causes of misinformation.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has occurred alongside a worldwide infodemic where
   unprecedented levels of misinformation have contributed to widespread
   misconceptions about the novel coronavirus. Conspiracy theories, poorly
   sourced medical advice, and information trivializing the virus have
   ignored national borders and spread quickly. This information spread has
   occurred despite generally strong preferences for domestic national
   media and social media networks that tend to be geographically bounded.
   How, then, is (mis)information crossing borders so rapidly? Using social
   media and survey data, we evaluate the extent to which consumption and
   propagation patterns of domestic and international traditional news and
   social media can help inform theorizing about cross-national information
   spread. In a detailed case study of Canada, we employ a large multi-wave
   survey and a massive data set of Canadian Twitter users. We show that
   the majority of misinformation circulating on Twitter that is shared by
   Canadian accounts is retweeted from U.S.-based accounts. Moreover,
   exposure to U.S.-based media outlets is associated with COVID-19
   misperceptions and increased exposure to U.S.-based information on
   Twitter is associated with an increased likelihood to post
   misinformation. We thus theorize and empirically identify a key
   globalizing infodemic pathway: disregard for national origin of social
   media posting.},

Title = {Linguistic imperialism: still a valid construct in relation to language
   policy for Irish Sign Language},

Abstract = {Linguistic imperialism-a term used to conceptualize the dominance of one
   language over others-has been debated in language policy for more than
   two decades. Spolsky (Language policy, Cambridge University Press,
   Cambridge, 2004), for example, has questioned whether the spread of
   English was a result of language planning, or was incidental to
   colonialism and globalization. Phillipson (Lang Policy 6(3):377-383,
   2007) contests this view, arguing that linguistic imperialism is not
   based on `conspiracy', and is underpinned by evidence of explicit or
   implicit language policy that aims to intentionally advantage some
   languages at the expense of others. This paper analyses Irish Sign
   Language policy, or lack thereof, in terms of linguistic imperialism. It
   does this by presenting evidence within a conceptual framework of
   linguistic imperialism to explore how discrimination and inequality
   occurs in relation to Irish Sign Language users in Ireland. The findings
   highlight many policies and practices that fit the linguistic
   imperialism paradigm including linguicism, audism, and the denial of
   linguistic rights. The paper, therefore, challenges some views in
   language policy that linguistic imperialism lacks credibility by
   highlighting a current case of minority language (ISL) users under
   imperialistic-like control of policy geared towards a dominant language
   (English).},

Abstract = {The 1889 Anti-Combines Act was the world's first modern competition law
   statute. However, despite its prominent place in history, it has been
   criticized as a failure and a ``political sham{''}. The author argues
   that while the Act did indeed turn out to be a failure, at its
   inception, it had potential to succeed. It failed because two later
   decisions of the House of Lords changed the common law on which the Act
   was based, making it substantially more difficult to prove that
   agreements covered by the Act were against the public interest, and
   thereby undermining the Act's efficacy. Critics of the Act do not
   appreciate the effect of those two decisions, and mistakenly read their
   effects back into the time when it was passed.
   In particular, the author refutes three main critiques of the
   Anti-Combines Act: that it extended only to conduct already
   ``unlawful{''} under the restraint of trade doctrine; that it
   criminalized only conduct already indictable under the crime of
   conspiracy; and that it was an intentional failure, a ``political
   sham{''}. He concludes that the Act should be remembered not as the
   failure it became as a victim of circumstance, but for the potential it
   had at its inception.},

Abstract = {Debate exists over the reasons for the demise of the trans-Atlantic
   slave trade to Brazil in 1850. An ``Enlightenment School{''} of
   historians highlights the political capacity of Brazilian statesmen.
   This perspective discounts slave resistance as influencing the decisions
   of high-ranking ministers in Rio de Janeiro. A ``Subaltern School{''}
   views slave resistance as a key variable in causing a permanent halt to
   disembarkations. In the wake of the Revolt of the Males in 1835 in
   Salvador, Bahia, the largest urban slave revolt in the history of the
   Americas, numerous observers called for an end to the slave trade. These
   individuals emphasized that continued importations boded ill for the
   empire. This essay posits that the arrival of thousands of African
   slaves to Brazil in the 1830s and 1840s caused severe social tensions.
   Elite and popular insecurity were particularly evident in the cities of
   Recife, Pernambuco, Salvador, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro. Several events
   caused a shift in opinion among high-ranking ministers and common folk
   by the late 1840s. The appearance of the British Squadron in Brazilian
   ports and along the coast heightened resistance among slaves and
   freedpersons. Slave revolts, slave conspiracies, fear of Muslim religion
   and distrust of African freedpersons forced representatives to seek a
   permanent halt to the slave trade.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},

Volume = {63},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-164},
Abstract = {Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) is a radical Muslim organisation whose
   origins go back two and a half decades. It espouses an ideology crafted
   during the 1950s by the Palestinian, Taqiuddin an-Nabhani. Hizbut
   Tahrir's international leadership exerts control over its Indonesian
   branch's activities to an extent virtually unprecedented in Indonesian
   political life. Like other radical Muslim movements, HTI is bitterly
   anti-Western and rejects capitalism, democracy, liberalism and
   pluralism. Its objective is to turn Indonesia into an Islamic state that
   would be merged into a global caliphate or Muslim superstate. Unusually
   for a radical group, HTI strictly eschews violence, though its rhetoric
   is often strident and inflammatory. HTI also opposes terrorism, but
   contrives to depict terrorist attacks that have taken place in Indonesia
   as the result of Western manipulation and conspiracies. Although HTI
   retains some elements of the clandestine life it led when it was first
   set up, it has provoked surprisingly little hostility from the
   Indonesian political mainstream or security authorities. It is likely to
   continue to grow and remain the source of a powerful critique of
   Indonesia's status quo. But this is no guarantee, however, that it will
   succeed even in the long term in positioning Indonesia for merger into
   an international caliphate.},

Abstract = {An analysis is reported of 2,408 wiretap conversations gathered in the
   course of prosecuting a heroin dealing organization in New York City in
   the 1990s. The five-step analysis, which included a social network
   analysis of phone contacts, revealed a large, loosely structured group
   of 294 individuals, most of whom had very limited contacts with others
   in the group. The group's active core comprised 38 individuals with
   extended contacts, little status differentiation and some task
   specialization. A smaller more tightly connected group of 22 individuals
   was somewhat independent of the remainder of the core and appeared to
   constitute a ``communal business{''}. The existence was not confirmed of
   the large criminal conspiracy described by the prosecution that operated
   at all levels of trafficking and dealing, from wholesale distribution to
   street sales. Rather, it appeared that the 294 individuals comprised one
   segment of the heroin market in the city. However, the discrepancy could
   be due to the fact that the prosecution drew upon a wider set of
   information about the individuals concerned than provided by the wiretap
   data. The study supports recent analyses that see organized crimes, such
   as drug trafficking, as mostly the work of small groups of loosely
   linked entrepreneurs rather than large, highly structured criminal
   syndicates.},

   Inquiry},
Journal = {REVISTA DE ANTROPOLOGIA SOCIAL},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {139-171},
Abstract = {In the last decade citizens of Serbia have described their bewildering
   social world in the idioms of magical realism, conspiracy theories,
   amorphous substances, kafkian burocratic parables, twilight, in-between
   states of consciousness. The social world was also likened to a dream or
   nightmare. Taking this cue from informants, I ask whether the Serbian
   ``imaginary{''} might not be more fruitfully figured as a ``dream{''}
   than as a ``text,{''} or a `` depository of dialogically intertwined
   narratives{''} -{''}stories Serbs tell themselves and others about
   themselves{''}-, as is frequent in `` interpretative anthropology.{''}
   In order to extract its maximal figurative potential, I thread the dream
   trope through Marxist social theory as a site of its most fruitful use
   -from its anticipation in Marx's varied figurations of modern
   capitalism's peculiar enchantments to its full development in the work
   of Siegfried Kracauer and Walter Benjamin-. I then turn from these
   ethnographers of metropolitan modernity to anthropological theory and
   the way it historically conceptualized the dream in the exotic
   peripheries it studied. By threading it through metropolitan social
   theory as well as the ethnography of peripheries, I seek to show the
   internal complexity of dream as a figure and to recommend its use to
   anthropology in the figuring of social thought and action.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to identify students' attitudes to scientific
   journals as a source of scientific information and the platform for
   publishing their own scientific results. The study was conducted in
   National Technical University of Ukraine ``Igor Sikorsky Kyiv
   Polytechnic Institute{''} (Kyiv, Ukraine). Quantitative analysis of 7
   closed ended responses, and qualitative analysis of 20 open ended
   responses were done. The study population included students (n = 720) of
   the fourth and fifth courses. The survey questionnaire captured the
   attitudes of students about scientific journals and their role in
   professional development, found out what percentage of students reads
   scientific journals, revealed whether the students understand
   information from them, as well as their ability to identify predatory
   journals thanks to media literacy. Predatory journals use to disseminate
   falsified, plagiarized, manipulative information, conspiracy theories,
   deviating from the publishing standards of editing and reviewing.
   Predatory publishing threats science, scientific communication, and the
   reputation of authors. We evaluated the level of critical thinking of
   students when choosing a source to publish scientific results, found out
   the reasons why students use or do not use scientific journals for their
   educational purposes, revealed how scientific journal can be used for
   education, and collected opinions about barriers that may prevent
   students from publishing scientific articles.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus pandemic is one of the biggest health crises of our
   time. In response to this global problem, various institutions around
   the world had soon issued evidence-based prevention guidelines. However,
   these guidelines, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and
   contribute to public well-being, are (deliberately) disregarded by some
   individuals. In the present study, we aimed to develop and test a
   multivariate model that could help us identify individual
   characteristics that make a person more/less likely to comply with
   COVID-19 prevention guidelines. A total of 525 attentive participants
   completed the online survey. The results of structural equation modeling
   (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both
   independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines,
   while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism,
   religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do
   so via the mediating role of trust in science. The described model
   exhibited an acceptable fit (chi(2)(1611) = 2485.84,p< .001, CFI = .91,
   RMSEA = .032, SRMR = .055). These findings thus provide empirical
   support for the proposed multivariate model and underline the importance
   of trust in science in explaining the different levels of compliance
   with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.},

Abstract = {Benefits of Internet of Things and cloud-fog-edge computing are
   associated with the risks of confidentiality, integrity, and
   availability related with the loss of information, denial of access for
   a long time, information leakage, conspiracy and technical failures. In
   this article, we propose a configurable, reliable, and confidential
   distributed data storage scheme with the ability to process encrypted
   data and control results of computations. Our system utilizes Redundant
   Residue Number System (RRNS) with new method of error correction codes
   and secret sharing schemes. We introduce the concept of an approximate
   value of a rank of a number (AR), which allows us to reduce the
   computational complexity of the decoding from RNS to binary
   representation, and size of the coefficients. Based on the properties of
   the approximate value and arithmetic properties of RNS, we introduce
   AR-RRNS method for error detection, correction, and controlling
   computational results. We provide a theoretical basis to configure
   probability of information loss, data redundancy, speed of encoding and
   decoding to cope with different objective preferences, workloads, and
   storage properties. Theoretical analysis shows that by appropriate
   selection of RRNS parameters, the proposed scheme allows not only
   increasing safety, reliability, and reducing an overhead of data
   storage, but also processing of encrypted data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

   the 1963 `Buddhist crisis' in South Vietnam},

Abstract = {Scholars have portrayed the 1963 `Buddhist crisis' in South Vietnam as a
   struggle for religious freedom, as a political conspiracy, or as a
   manifestation of ancient religious beliefs and practices. This paper, in
   contrast, argues that the crisis emerged from a clash ofmodernizing
   visions. The Buddhist-led protests that took place in South Vietnam in
   1963 were linked to the Vietnamese Buddhist revival, a nationalist
   reform movement that began during the early twentieth century. The
   protests also reflected growing Buddhist anxieties about the Ngo Dinh
   Diem government's nation-building agenda for South Vietnam. By the time
   the crisis began, Buddhist leaders had concluded that this agenda (which
   Diem referred to as the `Personalist Revolution') was incompatible with
   their plans to realize Vietnam's destiny as a `Buddhist nation'. In
   addition to reinterpreting the origins of the crisis, this paper
   examines how the course of events was shaped by the personalities and
   agendas of particular Buddhist and government leaders, and especially by
   fierce rivalries among members of Diem's family. These internal tensions
   help to explain the failure of attempts to end the crisis through
   negotiations, as well as Diem's decision to crush the movement by force
   in August 1963.},

Abstract = {Many threshold proxy signature schemes are proposed in which the t out
   of n threshold schemes are deployed; but they still lack the property of
   security. In this research paper, secret sharing proxy signature could
   permit the shares of designated signers, called proxy signers, renew
   their own proxy shares periodically without changing the secret. In
   particular, our scheme applies the (t, n) threshold proxy signature
   scheme and allows any t or more then t signers to form a designated
   group from n proxy signers to sign messages on behalf of the original
   signer. In the proposed scheme, furthermore, a proxy signer can recover
   his/her own share from t other proxy shares without revealing any
   information about other proxy shares. Unless more than t other proxy
   signers cooperate and collude, the secret share algorithm is always
   secure. We compare the performance of four schemes: Hwang et al., Wen et
   al., Geng et al. and Fengying et al. with the performance of a scheme
   that has been proposed by the authors of this article earlier. In the
   proposed scheme, both the combiner and the secret share holder can
   verify the correctness of the information that they are receiving from
   each other. Therefore, the enhanced threshold proxy signature scheme is
   secure and efficient against notorious conspiracy attacks.},

Title = {Essentialism and Attribution of Monstrosity in Racist Discourse:
   Right-wing Internet Postings about Africans and Jews},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY \& APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {We investigated a total of 4997 postings on an extreme right-wing
   Internet discussion board with regard to the groups and themes
   mentioned. The most frequently mentioned target groups were Africans,
   Jews, Muslims, Poles, and Turks; the most prominent themes and contexts
   were conspiracy, criminality, exploitation, threats to German identity,
   infiltration, mind control and harassment, procreation, rape, and sex.
   We analysed in detail postings about Africans/Blacks and Jews, that is
   target groups that were the most clearly connected to particular themes.
   The analysis reveals that extreme right-wing discourse essentializes the
   target groups of Jews and Africans/Blacks and ascribes them immutable
   group-specific attributes that effectively make them `natural kinds'.
   The group of Jews appears as a kind of their own with super-human powers
   and influence. Africans and Blacks are despised, firstly because their
   essential characteristics prohibit them to be categorically mixed with
   Germans (i.e. to become German by nationality) due to their incompatible
   essence, and secondly when they procreate with Whites. Such procreation
   produces `bastards' that are met with disgust. We argue that
   essentialist thinking about social and ethnic groups explains a good
   part of their rejection by right-wing followers. Copyright (C) 2009 John

Abstract = {We present a range of fluctuation and large deviations results for the
   logarithm of the characteristic polynomial Z of a random N x N unitary
   matrix, as N --> infinity. First we show that ln Z / root1/2 ln N,
   evaluated at a finite set of distinct points, is asymptotically a
   collection of i.i.d. complex normal random variables. This leads to a
   refinement of a recent central limit theorem due to Keating and Snaith,
   and also explains the covariance structure of the eigenvalue counting
   function. Next we obtain a central limit theorem for ln Z in a Sobolev
   space of generalised functions on the unit circle. In this limiting
   regime, lower-order terms which reflect the global covariance structure
   are no longer negligible and feature in the covariance structure of the
   limiting Gaussian measure. Large deviations results for ln Z/A,
   evaluated at a finite set of distinct points, can be obtained for root
   ln N much less than A greater than or equal to ln N. For higher-order
   scalings we obtain large deviations results for ln Z/A evaluated at a
   single point. There is a phase transition at A = ln N (which only
   applies to negative deviations of the real part) reflecting a switch
   from global to local conspiracy.},

Title = {So What if They're Lying to Us? Comparing Rhetorical Strategies for

Journal = {AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST},

Abstract = {Despite growing research on false information, a theoretical framework
   to organize findings is lacking. We use affect control theory to fill
   this need and introduce the affect-based credibility rating for
   interpreting the effectiveness of rhetorical strategies in discrediting
   the source of falsehoods. The rating quantifies the difference in
   connotations between the labels used to characterize the source and an
   ideal, credible source. Successful discrediting amplifies the
   difference. We use the rating to compare rhetorical strategies for
   discrediting opponents as sources during rival information campaigns
   about the Equal Rights Amendment. We show claiming the opponent is
   spreading disinformation rather than misinformation (stating the
   opponent is spreading falsehoods deliberately, rather than unwittingly)
   appears more effective at discrediting, particularly when disinformation
   claims allege more sinister motives for lying. The new rating helps
   organize findings by enabling direct comparisons between strategies,
   thereby contributing toward efforts to detect and discredit falsehoods
   in media.},

Abstract = {Research on the causes for vaccine resistance among Nigerian Muslims
   reveals what the philosopher Zizek terms a ``heaven in disorder:{''}
   lack of trust in public institutions, conspiracy theories, ignorance of
   basic science, individual apathy, and faith in ``Allah as the only
   protector.{''} Other social contexts demonstrate far greater compliance.
   How can governments improve outcomes in vaccine resistant communities
   amidst such complexity, especially in instances where theology provides
   a right to dissent? Alongside a right to dissent, ``obedience to
   authority{''} for the sake of social and political harmony is also an
   important principle of Islamic thought. It has the ability to enhance
   widespread compliance to public health guidelines by obligating the
   setting aside of private convictions in favor of collective cooperation.
   Religious literacy is an important element for responding effectively to
   pandemics, and by extension, other global emergencies. While
   policymakers must tailor their outreach to incommensurable worldviews in
   society, the human family must also imagine effective political models
   for cooperation despite divergence in worldviews. Otherwise, societies
   may need to choose between tyranny and anarchy. This article adds to
   efforts already underway which aim to demonstrate that engagement with
   religious norms, rather than their dismissal, represents the most
   promising path towards tackling vaccine resistance, especially in
   communities in which religious authority significantly informs social
   practice.},

   Attitudes toward the Vaccination Drive},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {It has been more than a year since the coronavirus (COVID-19) engulfed
   the whole world, disturbing the daily routine, bringing down the
   economies, and killing two million people across the globe at the time
   of writing. The pandemic brought the world together to a joint effort to
   find a cure and work toward developing a vaccine. Much to the
   anticipation, the first batch of vaccines started rolling out by the end
   of 2020, and many countries began the vaccination drive early on while
   others still waiting in anticipation for a successful trial. Social
   media, meanwhile, was bombarded with all sorts of both positive and
   negative stories of the development and the evolving coronavirus
   situation. Many people were looking forward to the vaccines, while
   others were cautious about the side-effects and the conspiracy theories
   resulting in mixed emotions. This study explores users' tweets
   concerning the COVID-19 vaccine and the sentiments expressed on Twitter.
   It tries to evaluate the polarity trend and a shift since the start of
   the coronavirus to the vaccination drive across six countries. The
   findings suggest that people of neighboring countries have shown quite a
   similar attitude regarding the vaccination in contrast to their
   different reactions to the coronavirus outbreak.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explore the political mythology created by the
   Polish government and its subservient organizations with an aim to
   legitimize quasi-militant democracy as a new form of sacred in the
   populist discourse during the pandemic. Drawing on theories of political
   myths and on intertextual qualitative document analysis, the research
   shows that the sacred appeared in political myths which proved to be an
   efficient means of gaining public support for all sorts of efforts that
   undermine democracy. The conspiracy myth established social divisions
   and produced effects along with the interrelated myths of the savior,
   unity, and the golden age. The government took on the role of a savior
   whose mission was to deliver Poles ``the people{''} from the hostile
   ``others{''} that put their lives and health at risk. Those who desire
   social and economic help and do not want to be excluded from the
   community, must submit to the yoke of the savior. The unity myth rested
   on the vision of Poles as the government's followers who exposed and
   reported transgressions for the good of the community. All the
   limitations to which Poles complied and the denunciatory actions they
   took were oriented towards the golden age of a strong state, providing
   social and economic security unique in the post-pandemic world.},

Abstract = {Scholars of Argentine cinema have engaged extensively with the
   oppositional politics of the Nuevo Cine of the 1960s and `70s, but much
   less with the cinema of that time that offered support to more
   conservative politics. In the interest of better understanding such
   support in mass culture, this essay contextualises the films made
   between 1970 and 1975 that star the pop idol Ramon ``Palito{''} Ortega
   and examines how his star persona - which had been constructed through
   television, songs, magazines, and films - evolves through the first half
   of the decade, asking how this evolution is significant in the period's
   turbulent context. In the films, Ortega functions as an avatar for a
   conservative bourgeois morality by delegitimising practices associated
   with, first, modern youth culture, then, after 1973, specific
   politically left practices, while exalting traditional practices that
   support social hierarchies compatible with the Peronist conservative
   orthodoxy. The essay finds that this process of politicisation runs from
   nostalgic nationalist reaction against modern internationalising youth
   culture to, with the legalisation and return to power of Peronism,
   examples of matter-of-fact anti-Communism and veiled anti-Semitism in
   affinity with the conspiracy theories propagated by the Far Right that
   took power in the pre-dictatorship period.},

Abstract = {What we are witnessing in these contemporary times isn't just the
   interplay of a racialised-populist sentiment in the political sphere
   through the amassing of political influence (political parties,
   campaigns, and policies). What we are also witnessing is the increasing
   performance of racialised-populist political sentiments in the very
   physical, and public spaces of society. The aim of this manuscript is to
   discuss this performance within the United States at four historical
   junctures of animation of leisure space and White Nationalist activity
   in public and private-public spaces: 1) 1925 Ku Klux Klan March; 2) the
   1939 German-American Bund Rally; 3) the 1977 National Socialist Party of
   America Rally; and, 4) the 2017 Unite the Right Rally. There is a
   complexity to the contestation of meanings and values ascribed to
   spaces. The political act of protesting is highlighted in its violation
   of the sanctum of these public and private-public spaces within the
   theoretical lenses of the White Genocide Conspiracy Theory or the Great
   Replacement Theory. Each highlights the impact of this growing White
   populism, and serves as a cautionary tale for appeals of counter
   activities and expressions of resistance with the animation, through
   protest and dissent, of public and private-public spaces.},

Abstract = {In the summer of 1722 Clementina Sobieska went to take the waters at
   Bagni di Lucca. A few weeks later, she was joined by her husband, James
   III Stuart, pretender to the English throne. The alleged reason for his
   trip was to acknowledge the warm welcome Clementina had received; the
   actual one was to get closer to the port of Genoa and be ready to sail
   should the Atterbury plot create the conditions for a Stuart
   restoration. Using hitherto overlooked archival evidence, I reconstruct
   the Pretender's Lucchese stay, with respect to episodes of court life
   (such as the performance of the royal touch); to the political debate
   that the event sparks off among the ruling class of the Republic on
   relations with king George I; and, most importantly, to the
   international picture painted by the reactions of James's inner circle
   to news reports of the `troubles' in England - which at first raised the
   Pretender's hopes - and later of the exposure of the Jacobite
   conspiracy, whose main actors were arrested. In the very same days,
   James issued a Declaration, clandestinely printed and dated from Lucca,
   which was to be distributed in England and to evoke comment in the major
   European courts.},

Title = {SUBSTANCE OVERLOAD: A COMPARATIVE EXAMINATION OF JAPANESE CORPORATE
   GOVERNANCE LAW THROUGH THE LENS OF THE DAIWA BANK CASE},

Abstract = {Japanese corporate governance law is facing a period of remarkable
   change. In light of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push for corporate
   governance reforms and the explosive news of Olympus Corporation's \$1.7
   billion accounting scandal in 2011, academics and practitioners alike
   are devoting renewed attention to the rules that govern Japan's
   boardrooms. This increased focus brings to the fore two key questions
   about Japan's modern corporate governance principles: how have they
   evolved and how are they applied in practice? To answer these questions,
   this article revisits the Daiwa Bank case, one of Japan's most stunning
   business scandals. This international criminal conspiracy resulted in
   one of the world's largest banks being banned from operating in the
   United States and gave rise to a seminal Japanese judicial opinion that
   found a single bank director personally liable to his employer for over
   \$500 million. By examining the law and legacy of the Daiwa Bank scandal
   and subsequent developments in Japanese statutory and case law, both on
   their own terms and in light of their analogues in Delaware, this
   article seeks to shed light on and critically evaluate the evolution and
   application of certain major Japanese corporate governance principles.},

Abstract = {The Soviets provided Cuba with the model of attacking human rights
   activities and organizations as a necessary extension of the Jewish
   Zionist conspiracy. The identification of Castro with forces dedicated
   to the destruction of Israel was made plain in proclamation and
   practice. The Cuban position is that the war on terrorism is actually an
   example of ``Liberation Imperialism.{''} Cubans make no reference to the
   repeated assaults on Israel, or the actual causes of the Middle East
   conflict-the denial of the right of Israel to exist as a Nation-State in
   that region. Anti-Semitism is so powerfully rooted as a cultural element
   in authoritarian cultures that even when, as in the case of Cuban
   communism, it entails the tortured twisting of doctrinal elements within
   Marxism-Leninism, such as doctrinal claims about the ``materialist
   foundations of society,{''} its leaders will sacrifice the ideology to
   the reality. Part of the Castro attachment to communism is an overall
   contempt for the Jewish mini-Diaspora within the larger flight of Cubans
   to the United States and other places where the practice of free speech
   remain unimpeded. The regime of Fidel Castro has changed little in the
   past 49 years, compared to the rest of the world.},

Volume = {62},

Abstract = {This article traces the emergence of private plaintiff antitrust lawyers
   after World War II and the debates they caused within the legal
   profession. Private enforcement of antitrust laws increased throughout
   the 1940s, especially following on government suits that proved
   conspiracy and price-fixing within major industries. The lawyers behind
   these cases-most notably after a major price-fixing scandal by
   electrical manufacturing companies in the 1960s-began to form their own
   identity and create collaborative networks to work on complex
   litigation. These attorneys advocated for changes by Congress that could
   expand the number of lawyers and increase opportunities for small
   businesses to find representation against the often large corporate
   defense counsels. But this sudden expansion, as well as the moral panic
   over new class action laws, created a perception that most plaintiff
   antitrust lawyers conjured up cases to enrich themselves over their
   clients. Soon, these debates shifted toward issues of ethics rather than
   the laws themselves. By the time the Chicago School transformed the way
   judges and the government approached antitrust, the private plaintiff
   lawyers found themselves increasingly assisting only a few well-funded
   clients. As a new age of populist antitrust takes shape in the present,
   this article investigates the debates that fueled the transformation of
   access to antitrust law within the context of the rights revolution.},

Abstract = {Discovering why the 2020 election turned out as it did will, given the
   complexities of American politics, take considerable time. Discovering
   how Trump lost and how Biden won will take longer. This article presents
   an initial foray in the latter direction by subjecting the rhetoric of
   the campaign to computerized language analysis via the DICTION program.
   In doing so, this study is the most recent outgrowth of the Campaign
   Mapping Project, begun at the University of Texas in Austin in 1995 and
   designed to produce comparative rhetorical data about presidential
   campaigns from 1948 to the present. The argument being made here is that
   Donald Trump lost the election by making excessive use of what Richard
   Hofstadter calls the Paranoid Style. In addition, Trump made exaggerated
   claims about abstract and unprovable conspiracies, all of which seemed
   derivative to voters worried about their health and their jobs in 2020.
   Joe Biden, in contrast, stressed Commonality-the need for shared purpose
   during a dangerous and dispiriting time. Biden also spoke directly of
   and to the people, thereby taking a page out of Trump's own 2016
   playbook. In many ways, Donald Trump's self-preoccupations made him
   blind to the needs of the electorate, a habit that developed over the
   course of his presidency and that ultimately cost him his job.},

Title = {Reflections on Dealing with Epistemically Vicious Students},
Journal = {DISPUTATIO-PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH BULLETIN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As a philosophy instructor, I strive to get my students to think
   critically about the subject matter. However, over the years I have
   encountered many students who seem to deliberately want to avoid
   thinking critically. I am talking particularly about some students in my
   ``Science and Religion{''} course, who subscribe to scientific
   creationism and endorse anti-scientific beliefs which seem to be
   irrational. In this essay, I will offer reflections of my experiences
   from these classes, and argue that individuals who subscribe to
   creationism exhibit a combination of epistemic vices that makes them
   prone to holding incorrect views. Employing Quassim Cassam's framework
   on the epistemic vices of conspiracy theorists in his ``Vice
   Epistemology{''}, I argue that the creationists' beliefs can best be
   understood as resulting from similar vices. Subsequently, I move to
   consider the reasons why these students subscribe to creationism, using
   Katherine Dormandy's analysis in her ``Does Epistemic Humility Threaten
   Religious Beliefs?{''} as a springboard. Following Dormandy, I explore
   how epistemic vices (in particular the lack of epistemic humility) lead
   to someone holding false -even irrational- beliefs. Finally, I will
   consider strategies in dealing with vice-charging the epistemically
   vicious students in a way that avoids the practical difficulties noted
   by Ian James Kidd in his ``Charging Others with Epistemic Vice{''}. (C)

Title = {Against a `rld of enemies': the impact of the First World War on the
   development of Hitler's ideology},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {90},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {317-336},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Adolf Hitler's experiences during the First World War have been much
   discussed, with historians tending to concentrate on his involvement in
   the fighting and the operational lessons he later claimed to draw. Much
   less has been written about the impact of the war on his world view,
   though recent work has tended to suggest that his paranoid anti-Semitism
   was not yet visible during the conflict. Drawing on this latest
   research, but also on newly discovered sources and previously underused
   material, the author shows that Hitler's main preoccupation during the
   war and its immediate aftermath was the overwhelming power of Great
   Britain and its American ally. He associated these two powers with the
   alleged international Jewish economic conspiracy that had crushed the
   German empire. Hitler's anti-Semitism thus originated in an
   anti-capitalist, rather than anti-communist, discourse. He blamed
   Britain and the US for the rigours of the Versailles peace settlement, a
   moment which was far more politically formative for him than the
   experience of defeat itself. His encounter with American soldiers in the
   summer of 1918 also marked his first engagement with the global power of
   the United States and the start of a belief in the demographic weakness
   of the German empire which inspired his plans for Lebensraum in the
   east.},

Abstract = {Accusations of anti-Semitism have become the habitualised weapon used
   against critics of Israeli war crimes. Most of such claims are built on
   the argument that there is a `New anti-Semitism' of the political left,
   as this is where the most critics of Zionism are based. This article
   maps the development of such bogus claims, originating in France and the
   US, where the two varieties of the argument are based; by analyzing such
   claims, it becomes clear that these are defence mechanisms of Zionism,
   designed to silence both the supporters of Palestine, as well as obscure
   the much more meaningful racism and xenophobia directed against Arabs
   and Muslims.},

Title = {Epistemic beliefs' role in promoting misperceptions and conspiracist

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Widespread misperceptions undermine citizens' decision-making ability.
   Conclusions based on falsehoods and conspiracy theories are by
   definition flawed. This article demonstrates that individuals' epistemic
   beliefs-beliefs about the nature of knowledge and how one comes to
   know-have important implications for perception accuracy. The present
   study uses a series of large, nationally representative surveys of the
   U.S. population to produce valid and reliable measures of three aspects
   of epistemic beliefs: reliance on intuition for factual beliefs (Faith
   in Intuition for facts), importance of consistency between empirical
   evidence and beliefs (Need for evidence), and conviction that
   ``facts{''} are politically constructed (Truth is political). Analyses
   confirm that these factors complement established predictors of
   misperception, substantively increasing our ability to explain both
   individuals' propensity to engage in conspiracist ideation, and their
   willingness to embrace falsehoods about high-profile scientific and
   political issues. Individuals who view reality as a political construct
   are significantly more likely to embrace falsehoods, whereas those who
   believe that their conclusions must hew to available evidence tend to
   hold more accurate beliefs. Confidence in the ability to intuitively
   recognize truth is a uniquely important predictor of conspiracist
   ideation. Results suggest that efforts to counter misperceptions may be
   helped by promoting epistemic beliefs emphasizing the importance of
   evidence, cautious use of feelings, and trust that rigorous assessment
   by knowledgeable specialists is an effective guard against political
   manipulation.},

Abstract = {This article has 3 goals: To describe the attitudes and experiences of
   staff on end-of-life care treatment of dying persons, to examine how the
   staff view their terminally ill patients, and to gather professionals'
   opinions on how their experiences impact their daily lives. It is a
   qualitative research inquiry based on a constructivist-grounded theory
   design. The study subjects were professionals who were part of
   palliative care services in Buenos Aires city during 2012. A purposive
   sample of 30 personnel answered an open-ended questionnaire assessing
   attitudes and perceptions concerning end-of-life. The results showed the
   following: (a) Good deaths were considered those in which physical
   symptoms were dealt with, where the patient was surrounded or on good
   terms with family members, and where they were at peace with themselves,
   any unfinished business, or God. Bad deaths were believed to be those
   where the patient was physically uncomfortable, were within a
   conspiracy-silence atmosphere, and died alone. (b) The factors in common
   that staff members identified regarding deaths were the need for
   spiritual comfort, peace, and acceptance and the need for attaining a
   deep connection with others. (c) The unexpected issues identified among
   end-of-life trajectories were the varying attitudes that patients had
   regarding death. (d) The personal life of the staff was affected by
   being in charge of end-of-life care decision making.},

Title = {Prefrontal lobotomy on Evita was done for behavior/personality
   modification, not just for pain control},
Journal = {NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS},

Abstract = {Eva Peron, best known as Evita, underwent a prefrontal lobotomy in 1952.
   Although the procedure was said to have been performed to relieve the
   pain of metastatic cancer, the author carried out a search for evidence
   that suggests that the procedure was prescribed to decrease violence and
   to modify Evita's behavior and personality, and not just for pain
   control.
   To further elucidate the circumstances surrounding the treatment of this
   well-known historic figure, the author reviewed the development of the
   procedure known as prefrontal lobotomy and its three main indications:
   management of psychiatric illness, control of intractable pain from
   terminal cancer, and mind control and behavior/personality modification.
   The role of pioneering neurosurgeons in the development of prefrontal
   lobotomy, particularly in Connecticut and at Yale University, was also
   studied, and the political and historical conditions in Argentina in
   1952 and to the present were analyzed.
   Evita was the wife of Juan Peron, who was the supreme leader of the
   Peronist party as well as president of Argentina. In 1952, however, the
   Peronist government in Argentina was bicephalic because Evita led the
   left wing of the party and ran the Female Peronist Party and the Eva
   Peron Foundation. She was followed by a group of hardcore loyalists
   interested in accelerating the revolution. Evita was also suffering from
   metastatic cervical cancer, and her illness increased her anxiety and
   moved her to purchase weapons to start training workers' militias.
   Although the apparent purpose was to fight her husband's enemies, this
   was done without his knowledge. She delivered fiery political speeches
   and wrote incendiary documents that would have led to a fierce clash in
   the country at that time.
   Notwithstanding the disreputable connotation of conspiracy theories,
   evidence was found of a potentially sinister political conspiracy, led
   by General Peron, to quiet down his wife Evita and modify her
   behavior/personality to decrease her belligerence, in addition to
   treating her cancer-related pain. Psychosurgery was purportedly intended
   to calm Evita and thus avoid a bloody civil war in Argentina. It was
   carried out in maximum secrecy and involved a distinguished American
   neurosurgeon, Dr. James L. Poppen, from the Lahey Clinic in Boston. A
   recorded and videotaped interview with a former scrub nurse and
   confidante of Dr. James L. Poppen revealed that prior to the lobotomy on
   Eva Peron, he performed lobotomies on a few prisoners in the prison
   system in Buenos Aires. Later, Dr. Poppen seems to have regretted his
   involvement and participation in this sad chapter in Argentine history.
   The treatment of Evita at the end of her life was influenced by
   extraordinary circumstances of time and place but also involved general
   issues of medical professionalism, the ethics of neuroscience, and the
   risks of being manipulated by labyrinthine byzantine politics. This
   story serves as a reminder that any physician, even one considered to be
   one of the best in the world, may act naively and become a pawn in a
   game he cannot begin to fathom.},

   Russia},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {49-60},
Abstract = {Despite being dissimilar cases, both Poland and Russia exhibit strong
   anti-liberal and democratic backsliding tendencies. Concomitantly,
   politicians are spreading a demographic moral panic, employing the
   argument that both nations are in danger of demise. There is
   scaremongering concerning below-replacement population growth rates and,
   in parallel, a tightening grasp on reproductive health rights and a
   growing fear of non-binary gender identities, people of color, and
   homosexuality. The political anti-gender mobilization in Poland in the
   2010s and the gendered anti-Western and anti-gay conspiracy narratives
   in Russia are examples of this phenomenon. How are the policy responses
   to ``demographic crises{''} constructed and gendered in political
   discourses today? What lies behind it and what is its role in illiberal
   politics? In this article, I discuss the current demographic discourses
   in Poland and in Russia. I argue that the politics of rallying against
   ``demographic crises{''} surfaced on the wave of growing dominance of
   ultraconservative and nationalist discourses in East-Central Europe in
   response to perceived socio-economic pressures. I demonstrate how Polish
   and Russian politicians have been utilizing nativism, familialism, and
   ``tradition{''} discourses for reasons of political legitimacy and
   expediency. Looking at political debates and concrete demographic
   strategies, I trace how the rhetoric of ``democratic crises{''} is
   deployed to shore up illiberalism in both countries.},

Abstract = {While the Federal Patent and Copyright Acts give patent and copyright
   holders limited exclusive rights in intellectual property, the Sherman
   Act prohibits combinations or conspiracies that restrain trade and
   monopolization. Although firms possessing intellectual property
   generally exercise their statutory exclusionary rights without running
   afoul of the antitrust laws, conduct may plausibly be authorized by
   intellectual property law but forbidden by antitrust. In construing the
   two statutory schemes, federal courts have generally held that conduct
   authorized by the intellectual property laws, in the absence of some
   further inculpatory action, cannot form the basis for antitrust
   liability. The Ninth Circuit departed from this trend in the recent
   opinion of Image Technical Services, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., holding
   that a unilateral refusal to deal in patented and copyrighted material
   can alone constitute sufficiently exclusionary conduct to state a
   section 2 Sherman Act claim for monopolization or attempted
   monopolization. In so holding, the Ninth Circuit ignored relevant
   precedent and crafted a test that offers little practical guidance on
   the limits of a patent or copyright holder's exclusionary powers in the
   context of a Sherman Act section 2 claim. This Note argues that, while
   the Ninth Circuit reached the correct conclusion in this case, the
   court's broad test insufficiently protects holders of intellectual
   property from antitrust attack for exercising their
   statutorily-authorized exclusive rights, and offers no compelling
   tangible benefit to consumers.},

Title = {Experimental Non-Violation of the Bell Inequality},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A finite non-classical framework for qubit physics is described that
   challenges the conclusion that the Bell Inequality has been shown to
   have been violated experimentally, even approximately. This framework
   postulates the primacy of a fractal-like `invariant set' geometry I-U in
   cosmological state space, on which the universe evolves
   deterministically and causally, and from which space-time and the laws
   of physics in space-time are emergent. Consistent with the assumed
   primacy of I-U, a non-Euclidean (and hence non-classical) metric g(p) is
   defined in cosmological state space. Here, p is a large but finite
   integer (whose inverse may reflect the weakness of gravity). Points that
   do not lie on I-U are necessarily g(p)-distant from points that do. g(p)
   is related to the p-adic metric of number theory. Using number-theoretic
   properties of spherical triangles, the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)
   inequality, whose violation would rule out local realism, is shown to be
   undefined in this framework. Moreover, the CHSH-like inequalities
   violated experimentally are shown to be g(p)-distant from the CHSH
   inequality. This result fails in the singular limit p = infinity, at
   which g(p) is Euclidean and the corresponding model classical. Although
   Invariant Set Theory is deterministic and locally causal, it is not
   conspiratorial and does not compromise experimenter free will. The
   relationship between Invariant Set Theory, Bohmian Theory, The Cellular
   Automaton Interpretation of Quantum Theory and p-adic Quantum Theory is
   discussed.},

Journal = {COMUNICAR},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The news site ro.sputnik.md is the Romanian language version of the
   Sputnik news website platform, owned by the Russian government, one of
   the main channels used by the Kremlin to disseminate mis- and
   disinformation across Russian borders. The current research aims to
   identify the frames associated with anti-COVID-19 vaccines, and the news
   values employed in constructing news discourse on vaccination in
   ro.sputnik.md media texts. To map the media frames and the lexical and
   discursive constructions, the research proposes a mixed methods
   content-based approach, where automated text analysis (frequency,
   co-occurrence, n-grams) is combined with thematic and discourse
   analysis. Six emphasis frames are identified in the corpus (N=1,165):
   Superiority of the Russian Sputnik V Vaccine, Fatal/Side Effects of EU
   Authorized Vaccines, Limitations of Individual Rights and Freedoms, EU
   and/or Romanian Authorities' Struggle, Children and Teenagers'
   Protection, and Big Pharma Conspiracy. The findings show that specific
   discursive patterns are associated with the negative news value: death,
   side effects (blood clot, thrombosis, coagulation), restrictions, and
   interdictions or warnings (serious, risk, negative, panic, etc.), while
   the conflict news value is associated with warfare vocabulary (defense,
   threat, battle, fire, gunpowder, etc.); and eliteness, with well-known
   actors (state leaders, European leaders, famous ``conspirators{''}) and
   countries (powerful international actors, meaningful neighbours).},

Title = {THE KOKURYUKAI (BLACK DRAGON SOCIETY) AND THE RISE OF NATIONALISM,

Abstract = {In the conduct of prewar Japanese foreign relations, political
   associations (seiji kessha) - we might also call them pressure groups -
   exerted considerable political influence, particularly on Japan's
   relations with China and other Asian nations. One of the best known of
   these political associations is the Kokuryukai (the ``Amur Society,{''}
   also known as the `` Black Dragon Society{''}), which was founded in
   1901 and, in 1946, was banned as an ultranationalist association by the
   American occupation authorities. The Kokuryukai was also identified as
   the center of an expansionist conspiracy to steer Japan towards war with
   the Western powers.
   In the absence of detailed studies of the Kokuryukai, this article aims
   to clarify the organization's political views and activities and to
   demonstrate its influence on Japanese foreign relations and involvement
   in East Asia in the early twentieth century. Drawing on primary sources
   such as the association's publications and its leaders' memoranda and
   letters, I show that the Kokuryukai engaged in intensive networking
   activities and the accumulation of social capital involving not only
   Japanese but also Chinese and Korean politicians and diplomats.
   Nevertheless, I conclude that the association's influence on the origins
   of the Asia-Pacific War should not be overstated, since its activities
   reached a climax in the late 1910s and effectively ended with the death
   of founder Uchida Ryohei in 1937.},

Abstract = {Objective Knowledge on anti-semitism and its effects as an attitude is
   limited. We seek to assess its relationship with other out-group
   measures and its predictive ability on political judgments. We seek to
   (a) study the properties of a measure of anti-semitism; (b) explore the
   relationship between anti-semitism and other frequently used measures of
   out-group attitudes; (c) assess the key demographic predictors of
   endorsement of anti-semitic beliefs; (d) evaluate the predictive ability
   of our measure of anti-semitism in models predicting support for the
   QAnon conspiracy theory and vote for Trump in the 2020 election. Data
   and Methods This study utilizes two national online surveys fielded in
   January and August 2020 that are weighted to match the U.S. population.
   We utilize a Bayesian factor analytic approach to assess the
   relationship between various out-group measures. We also use regression
   analyses to predict the correlates of anti-semitism and to test the
   relationship between anti-semitism and support for QAnon and for Trump.
   Results Our results show that anti-semitism shares more variance with
   xenophobia than anti-black prejudice suggesting that people tend to
   perceive Jews as national outsiders not as racial others. Furthermore,
   anti-semitism is a strong positive predictor of both support for QAnon
   and intent to vote for Donald Trump.},

Journal = {PRZEGLAD SEJMOWY},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {25-47},
Abstract = {The idea of summoning the Legislative Seimas arose at the beginning of
   Lithuania's independence. In the years 1918-1919 Lithuania's situation
   was very difficult. At the beginning of 1919, the government introduced
   martial law. The elections did not take place until April 1920. A
   coalition of Christian Democrats was victorious. There was also a
   representation of national minorities in the parliament. Christian
   democracy soon decided that the state of emergency helped retain the
   power. For this reason, the law was maintained and extended. The
   opposition protested in vain, as the ruling group had the majority of
   votes in the Seimas. Christian Democrats also won the elections in 1922
   and 1923. Their rule can be called ``parliamentary dictatorship{''}. The
   authorities used democratic procedures to apply authoritarian practices.
   It was only after the elections in 1926 that the Christian Democrats
   lost parliamentary majority. The coalition of the agrarian party and
   Social Democrats abolished the state of emergency and introduced a
   number of reforms. However, a military conspiracy was formed against the
   government, supported by Christian Democrats and nationalists. In
   December 1926, a coup took place. The initiative was taken over by
   nationalists (tautinkai), who quickly abandoned the alliance with
   Christian Democrats. Nationalists led by Antonias Smetona dissolved the
   Seimas and introduced dictatorial rule. They also restored martial law.},

Title = {Imagining socioecological transformation: An analysis of the Welsh
   Government's policy innovations and orientations to the future},
Journal = {ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {This article explores how the Welsh Government's recent policy
   innovations in climate change and environmental sustainability can be
   read in terms of their imaginative capacity for transformation. The
   Welsh Government is one of only a few governments in the world to have a
   legal duty to sustainable development, which includes the pioneering
   Well-being of Future Generations Act (2015). The legislation has
   received international attention and praise from the United Nations but,
   as yet, the Welsh Government's imaginaries of socioecological
   transformation have received little scrutiny regarding the kinds of
   ideas about the future and possibilities for change they set in motion.
   The article considers imaginaries as providing the very grounds of
   possibility for transformation, being comprised of stories and
   narratives about what kinds of futures are possible and desirable,
   intermingled with emotional-affective ``atmospheres{''} that can promote
   or hinder people's engagement with environmental issues. The article
   focuses on three aspects of the Welsh Government's imaginaries related
   to socioecological transformation, namely; resilience and anticipatory
   discourse, linear time, and ``conspiracies of optimism{''}. A number of
   tensions are drawn out that highlight how the Welsh Government's
   seemingly progressive rhetoric risks being undermined by the conceptions
   of time and change it employs. Thus, the article contributes to wider
   critical analyses of how new politics and modes of governance of and for
   the (proposed) Anthropocene are taking shape.},

Title = {MUNICH CRISIS: BEHIND - THE SCENE HISTORY},
Journal = {MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {3},
Pages = {91-122},
Abstract = {The article links the tragic historical past of Czechoslovakia, which
   paid its price for the rejection of sovereignty as a result of its
   elite's national policy, with the current political discourse around
   globalization and national interests, the influence of external forces
   on the policies of dependent states, and often the negative consequences
   of this influence.
   Much of today's policies of the leading Western powers, primarily the
   United States, echo their actions during the preparation and
   implementation of the Munich conspiracy. Playing on international
   contradictions while staying aside, turning in a victim to an aggressor,
   etc. are dangerous policies both in the past and today and lead to
   serious international consequences for their organizers and inspirers.
   Unlike numerous works on this subject, which have appeared in Russia and
   abroad, focusing mainly on the activities of European << appeasers >>,
   the author of the article shows the hidden role of American diplomacy in
   deciding the fate of Czechoslovakia. The US was headed by President
   Franklin Roosevelt - an acknowledged master of the game on international
   controversies, avoiding being on the foreground of world politics on
   dubious issues.
   To clarify the role of the US in European politics during the Munich
   crisis, the article draws on original sources from the archive of the
   American ambassador to the Soviet Union, J. Davis from the Library of
   Congress.},

Title = {Colonial discourse, poetic language, and the Igbo masquerading culture
   in Ezenwa-Ohaeto's <i>The Voice of the Night Masquerade</i>},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFRICAN CULTURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-63},
Abstract = {Until the recent effacement of aspects of the Igbo traditional values
   through the combined and sustained conspiracy of Western colonialism and
   Christian evangelical missions, the masquerade was one of the most
   venerated symbols of the people's social cohesion. It was particularly
   revered for its juridical functions in many Igbo communities. Whereas it
   provided entertainment to the communities, it was also often evoked as
   the most important symbol of justice amongst the people. This paper
   offers a critical reading of Ezenwa-Ohaeto's The Voice of the Night
   Masquerade, a work of rare achievement that brings into focus not only
   aspects of the cultural idiosyncrasies of the Igbo of South Eastern
   Nigeria through the cultural genre of the night masquerade, but also
   does so with an elegance that resurrects the age-long question on the
   nature of the language of traditional African poetry which engaged
   scholars like Chinweizu and his team, Wole Soyinka, and many others
   during the long, and continuing quest for the decolonization of the
   African mind. It locates aspects of Igbo language and culture through
   the vision and mannerism of Ezenwa-Ohaeto. The Voice of the Night
   Masquerade, it concludes, is particularly relevant because its ethics
   and aesthetics provide profound insight as a postcolonial statement in
   social equipoise that debunks colonialist civilizational assumptions of
   Africa.},

Title = {The Dis/ability Coordinates of the Critical Gesture and Matters of Care},
Journal = {SOCIOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {55},
Number = {5},
Pages = {587-613},
Abstract = {Critique is one of the social sciences' most respectable tasks,
   especially when its aim is to emancipate people oppressed for their
   otherness. However, there is also a critique of critique as a disabling
   tool, replacing the obvious actors revealed as `fictitious' with
   synthetic objects that the critic herself deems more `factual'. This
   article understands the critical gesture as a pragmatic resource for
   re-organising the field of dis/abilities. In the first part of the
   article, we make three critical gestures together with Jose, a person
   identified as mentally ill. A paranoid vision of a secret conspiracy, a
   naturalising concept of disease, and the critique of stigma all seek to
   radically redraw the dis/ability coordinates, but their emancipatory
   potential is thwarted by the complex interconnectedness of their
   objects. Jose's recovery thus ultimately hinges on a delicate balancing
   act combining critique and composing. In this sense, his effort
   resembles the careful treading of lay and professional critics in the
   last part of our text, in which we try to solve problems of living with
   dementia together with the Hanus family. While the critical gesture has
   an essential role to play here as well, close ethnographic encounters
   are rather about jointly articulating the critical matters of care,
   wherein the problematic agencies of both obvious and not-so-obvious
   actors are acknowledged.},

Abstract = {The authors examine the strategy and tactics of counteracting
   drug-related crimes in Kazakhstan, the problems of improving criminal
   law norms regulating liability for illegal drug trade: production,
   processing, purchasing, storing, transporting, sending or selling
   narcotics, psychoactive substances or their analogues and precursors
   (Art. 296 and 297 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan).
   There are two categories of people involved in illegal trade of
   narcotics, psychoactive substances or their analogues and precursors:
   users of narcotics, psychoactive substances or their analogues, and
   those who distribute these narcotics, psychoactive substances or their
   analogues, the latter being more dangerous than people suffering from
   substance abuse. This is a determining factor that shapes criminal
   policy in the sphere of criminalizing and penalizing liability for
   drug-related crimes in Kazakhstan criminal legislation. The authors
   analyze the two-tier system of criminal offences, the legislative novels
   on liability for non-medical use of narcotics, psychoactive substances
   or their analogues and precursors in public places, and the court
   practice of sentencing drug addicts to incarceration. They pay attention
   to the role of the state and the society in shaping criminal policy
   regarding drug dealers, formulate suggestions on improving such
   qualifying circumstances as a crime committed by a group of persons by
   prior conspiracy, as part of an organized group, involving narcotics,
   psychoactive substances or their analogues in large or very large
   quantities.},

Abstract = {In this article, I discuss surveys, academic debates, and research on
   antisemitism among Muslims in Muslim-majority countries and in Europe
   today. After a review of antisemitism in both cases, different
   explanations for its causes are presented. Negative attitudes towards
   Jews in Muslim countries are the rule, not the exception. An important
   factor in almost all Muslim countries are anti-Zionist attitudes and
   agitations that are mixed with antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy
   theories. In Europe, antisemitism is more prevalent among Muslims than
   among non-Muslims and Muslims are disproportionately often involved in
   antisemitic incidents.
   It turns out that antisemitism among Muslims is manifested in many ways
   and that it has many causes. One-dimensional explanations are not
   sufficient. Arguments that antisemitism is primarily a result of the
   Middle East conflict or of discrimination/colonization seem to be
   outdated in view of new research. Historically, the interaction of Arab
   nationalism, Islamist movements, and the collaboration with the Nazis in
   the middle of the 20th century played a significant role in ensuring
   that the discriminatory treatment of Jews in Islam in the Middle Ages
   did not disappear in the course of establishing nation states, but was
   converted to a large extent into antisemitism. Today, Islamist
   influences and stereotypes that are passed on by media and within social
   circles are essential factors for the prevalence of antisemitic
   attitudes among Muslims.},

Abstract = {The concept of `core labour rights' has, over the last decade or so,
   assumed a central role in debates about the role of international labour
   law in an integrated world economy. Some, including Philip Alston, see
   this development as a retreat from and a threat to the existing
   international labour law regime, especially the International Labour
   Organization's international labour code. On this view the new
   concentration upon core rights undermines the existing regime from
   within by narrowing its focus, weakening the legal status of the core
   rights, relegating the `non-core' to a second-class status, watering
   down its `enforcement' mechanisms, and so oil. This view, while popular,
   is available only oil a very narrow and conventional understanding of
   the purpose of international labour law. A better understanding is
   available which enables us to see core labour lights its conceptually
   coherent (and not politically arbitrary). morally salient (and trot
   merely part of air empty neo-liberal conspiracy) and pragmatically vital
   to the achievement of our true goods, including tire `enforceability' of
   the `non-core' (and not air undermining of the whole regime from
   within). This essay defends this second and positive account of core
   rights by reacting to Philip Alston's recent essay in this journal,
   which is taken as the most comprehensive and aggressive articulation of
   the `anti-core rights' point of view.},

Title = {COVID-19 Vaccination Rollout: Aspects of Hesitancy in South Africa},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Across the globe, comprehensive COVID-19 vaccination programs have been
   rolled out. Naturally, it remains paramount for efficiency to ensure
   uptake. Hypothetical vaccine acceptability in South Africa was high
   prior to the availability of inoculation in August 2020-three-quarters
   stated intent to immunize nationally. However, 24 months on, less than
   one-third have finished their vaccination on a national average, and in
   the sprawling South Western Townships (Soweto), this figure remains
   troublingly low with as many as four in every five still hesitant.
   Medical anthropologists have recently portrayed how COVID-19's jumbled
   mediatization produces a `field of suspicion' casting serious doubt on
   authorities and vaccines through misinformation and counterfactual
   claims, which fuels `othering' and fosters hesitancy. It follows that
   intent to immunize cannot be used to predict uptake. Here, we take this
   conceptual framework one step further and illustrate how South African
   context-specific factors imbricate to amplify uncertainty and fear due
   the productive nature of communicability, which transforms othering into
   racialization and exacerbates existing societal polarizations. We also
   encounter Africanized forms of conspiracy theories and find their
   narrational roots in colonization and racism. Finally, we discuss
   semblances with HIV and how the COVID-19 pandemic's biomedicalization
   may inadvertently have led to vaccine resistance due to medical
   pluralism and cultural/spiritual practices endemic to the townships.},

Title = {Superdeterminism: a reappraisal},
Journal = {SYNTHESE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {200},
Number = {5},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {This paper addresses a particular interpretation of quantum mechanics,
   i.e. superdeterminism. In short, superdeterminism i) takes the world to
   be fundamentally deterministic, ii) postulates hidden variables, and
   iii) contra Bell, saves locality at the cost of violating the principle
   of statistical independence. Superdeterminism currently enjoys little
   support in the physics and philosophy communities. Many take it to posit
   the ubiquitous occurrence of hard-to-digest conspiratorial and
   coincidental events; others object that violating the principle of
   statistical independence implies the death of the scientific
   methodology. In this paper, we offer a defense to these and other
   objections. To counter the conspiracy objection, we draw upon the
   philosophical literature on time travel, and conclude that the picture
   of the world offered by the superdeterminist does not need to be
   particularly surprising or conspiratorial. We then move on to other
   recent objections, in particular those that focus on the methodology of
   science and the nature of the physical laws compatible with
   superdeterminism. A key ingredient of our arguments is that the
   principle of statistical independence may be violated in theory, but
   valid for practical purposes. Our overarching goal is to offer a defense
   of superdeterminism with respect to its main objections, so that it can
   earn its keep as a legitimate contender among the possible
   interpretations of quantum mechanics.},

Title = {FROM <i>HUMANITAS TO AMICITIA</i>: CICERO'S LETTER TO TREBONIUS BETWEEN
   PRAISES FOR CALVUS AND ECHOES OF CATULLUS (<i>FAM</i>. 15.21)},
Journal = {HUMANITAS-PORTUGAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {77},
Pages = {87-109},
Abstract = {The article aims to investigate Cicero's epistle Fam. 15.21 (46 BC),
   which is addressed to Trebonius, a former colleague of him and now a
   lieutenant of Caesar, and deals with the oratory of Calvus, an Atticist
   (and Catullus' best friend), to whom Cicero had given praise and
   rhetorical advice in a previous letter. Cicero shows affection to
   Trebonius, and care to Calvus, although they weren't quite friends of
   him and belonged to different parties, both in politics and oratory. An
   examination of the text from the point of view of form and content shows
   here a double example of humanitas both as benevolence (philantrophia)
   and as an intellectual and didactic approach (paideia). It seems the
   prelude to a true friendship (which is also the theme of a future
   dialogue of Cicero), maybe with further effects (Trebonius will
   participate in the conspiracy against Caesar). Moreover, several
   allusions and some playful situations related to the letter (such as the
   gift of a book containing Cicero's jokes) recalls Catullus' poems to his
   friends (above all to Calvus), confirming the idea of a literary contact
   between the poeta novus and the orator. The result is an intertwining of
   personal and cultural relationships between personalities who are
   traditionally believed to be on opposite sides, but are closer than one
   might think in Cicero's correspondence.},

Abstract = {Developments in the law are making the corporate form more opaque and
   allowing the agents who animate it to escape individual accountability
   for their actions. The law now provides protection for agents to engage
   in widespread frauds that inflict massive harm on the public. This
   Article challenges the academic orthodoxy that shareholder and director
   liability are enough to control agent behavior by developing a paper
   dragon analogy to focus on the importance of agents in corporate
   animation. Instead of hollow procedural shells, modern corporations
   should be understood as paper dragons in a parade costumes animated by
   agents who are the dancers under the fabric that make it move. We focus
   on the dragon costume itself to the exclusion of recognizing the
   presence and responsibility of those agents.
   Lack of agent accountability under the dragon costume encourages the
   patterns of fraud that caused the 2007-2008 financial crisis in which 45
   percent of the world's wealth disappeared, and those patterns continue
   to be repeated. This Article reveals how making the corporate form more
   opaque has led to the destruction of corporate conspiracy charges for
   individuals and now the implosion of securities law as a method of
   disciplining agents. The Article concludes with a call for both watching
   the paper dragon and the need to track the dancers who move its feet.},

Abstract = {This article details the long-standing struggle within the American far
   right between those whose mission it is to resist the perceived
   subversion of international communism and its neo-Soviet successors now
   in power in the Kremlin and those whose mission is dedicated to
   preserving the White Race from the twin threats of miscegenation and
   marginalization from the corridors of power. Using the metaphor of the
   1984 low-budget spectacular Red Dawn and noting the current pattern of
   Russian interference in the election and contacts with the Trump
   campaign, it traces the struggle from the ascendancy of anti-communism
   in the 1950s and 1960s to the current triumph of the race warriors and
   conspiracy theorists who championed the candidacy of Donald Trump. Red
   Dawn Is Now concludes with the observation that, for those who most fear
   foreign subversion, the revelations about Russian penwetration of the
   American election process and the Trump presidency represents a
   21st-century version of the Soviet occupation that the young patriots of
   Red Dawn fame successfully repelled. If this is so, it suggests the
   possibility that Thomas Jefferson's observation that the tree of liberty
   must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots \&
   tyrants may be prophetic and that the fifth wave of terrorism might at
   long last be at hand.},

Title = {Humour as a Sensitisation Tool in Nigerian Comedy Skits about Covid-19},

Abstract = {Previous studies in educational pedagogy and commercial marketing have
   focused on the perceived impact of humour in dissolving barriers to
   positive consumer behaviour. However, the function of humour as a
   sensitisation tool during a pandemic is yet to attract scholarly
   attention. The article addresses this gap by examining the strategies
   some popular Nigerian comedians have resorted to in the social media
   landscape to sensitise citizens to the need to adhere to Covid-19 safety
   protocols. The study draws on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), a
   theory of persuasion which postulates that persuasive information is
   processed through two distinct psychological routes: central and
   peripheral, the first leading to positive reception and the second to
   negative reception. Through exploring purposively sampled skits, the
   study uncovers the strategies deployed to counter harmful conspiracy
   narratives about the pandemic in Nigeria. It is argued that the positive
   responses on the part of certain characters to the comedians' humorous
   messages imply that these skits are an effective sensitisation tool. The
   article concludes that because most Nigerians lack confidence in
   government policies due to increasing socioeconomic failures and
   clumsiness in handling the Covid-19 pandemic, the strategies used by the
   comedians to sensitise audience members to safety protocols are more
   creative and effective than the government's messaging. In effect, the
   comedians become strategic partners in the war against Covid-19.},

Title = {To vaccinate or not to vaccinate: A mandatory or conscience decision?},
Journal = {STELLENBOSCH THEOLOGICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Faith communities are challenged during the COVID-19 pandemic to urge
   their members to take a decision to vaccinate or not to vaccinate. The
   relationship between religion and medical sciences, especially with
   regard to vaccination, has not always meant that they complemented each
   other, but there is general agreement amongst religions that vaccination
   is acceptable to save lives. The purpose of vaccination is to secure
   herd or population immunity, but the spread of misinformation about
   vaccines and conspiracy theories, some based on religious beliefs, puts
   all vaccination efforts at risk. It ultimately influences the decision
   people should make to vaccinate or not to vaccinate. The question of
   mandatory vaccination for all and vaccination based on an individual
   decision according to conscience seems like a paradox, but the
   comprehensive, second-level normative ethical approach or ethic of
   responsibility proposed by De Villiers (2020) can be helpful to address
   this dichotomy. This is in line with an ethics within an African context
   that is indigenous, interdependent, and holistic. The article follows an
   interdisciplinary approach that incorporates contributions from the
   fields of medical science, religion, and ethics. A comprehensive,
   second-level, normative ethical approach provides contextual
   appropriateness and an adequate continuity with ethical traditions that
   are helpful to address vaccine hesitancy and create therapeutic
   alliances to address challenges presented by the pandemic.},

   PRAYING HOUSES DURING THE LATE SOVIET ERA},

Abstract = {The article describes how illegal praying houses belonging to the
   supporters of the Council of the Churches of evangelical
   Christian-Baptists banned by the government were functioning in the
   Soviet Union during the 1960s-1980s. Using the documentation of the
   Council for Religious Affairs and its regional representatives,
   discovered in the State Archive of the Russian Federation and the State
   Archive of the Altai region, the article researches the practices used
   by the believers to create the so-called ``house churches{''}, which
   allowed the commune to avoid governmental interventions into its
   religious life. The paper characterizes the main components of this
   specific activity, such as conspiracy, pursuit of the autarky by
   religious dissidents and the readiness to ``suffer{''} for the freedom
   of conciseness. Another part of the article describes and analyzes
   repressive practices of the government aimed at dismantling the ``house
   churches{''}, on one hand, and demolishing illegal stationary praying
   houses, on the other. The author concludes that the government was not
   able to solve the problem of the ``house churches{''} up until the
   dissolution of the USSR. The main reason for that, other than the
   ``headstrong stubbornness{''} of the believers, was the low efficiency
   of repressive mechanisms, such as administrative fines and dispersal of
   praying meetings in the light of the dominant ``socialistic legality{''}
   in the Brezhnev era.},

Title = {Approximation, Mad Men and the Death of JFK},
Journal = {FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this article I take the US television series Mad Men (2007-present)
   as an exemplary `approximation', a term I adopt to signal the way in
   which certain texts construct a changeable, fluid `truth' resulting from
   collisions, exchange and dialectical argument. Approximations are
   layered, their formal layerings mirroring a layered, multifaceted
   argument. Mad Men integrates and represents real historical events
   within a fictional setting, and act that suggests that an event or
   action can never be finished, fixed and not open to reassessment.
   Specifically, this article examines `The Grown Ups', Episode 12 of
   Season 3, which charts the events of 22 November 1963, the day Kennedy
   was assassinated. Although we might be able to bring to mind the images
   and conspiracy theories that have been made available since (such
   Abraham Zapruder's 8 mm home movie footage of the assassination), these
   images were not available at the time. Mad Men as a series always
   strives to represent its historical milieu as authentically as possible,
   so the characters re-enact 22 November 1963 as authentically as possible
   by watching only what was on television that day (the news bulletin,
   Walter Kronkite's announcement that Kennedy is dead). The contemporary
   backdrop to these events, including the resonances of `9/11' through Mad
   Men, inform and collide with the authenticity on the screen.},

Title = {A simple quantum test for smooth horizons},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2020},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {We develop a new test that provides a necessary condition for a quantum
   state to be smooth in the vicinity of a null surface: ``near-horizon
   modes{''} that can be defined locally near any patch of the null surface
   must be correctly entangled with each other and with their counterparts
   across the surface. This test is considerably simpler to implement than
   a full computation of the renormalized stress-energy tensor. We apply
   this test to Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in asymptotically anti-de
   Sitter space and provide numerical evidence that the inner horizon of
   such black holes is singular in the Hartle-Hawking state. We then
   consider BTZ black holes, where we show that our criterion for
   smoothness is satisfied as one approaches the inner horizon from
   outside. This results from a remarkable conspiracy between the
   properties of mode-functions outside the outer horizon and between the
   inner and outer horizon. Moreover, we consider the extension of
   spacetime across the inner horizon of BTZ black holes and show that it
   is possible to define modes behind the inner horizon that are correctly
   entangled with modes in front of the inner horizon. Although this
   provides additional suggestions for the failure of strong cosmic
   censorship, we lay out several puzzles that must be resolved before
   concluding that the inner horizon will be traversable.},

Abstract = {Techno-borne organs (TBO) are promising organ-repair strategies in a
   broad spectrum of terminal diseases. Their benefit/risk ratio is debated
   in medical, legal, and religious circles. An attempt was made to
   elucidate risks and advantages in implication of the TBO. Findings
   suggest that the TBO, created from either autologous, syngenic or
   isogenic cells, is an auspicious frontier that eliminates risks
   associated to the traditional transplantation of the donor organs:
   incompatibility, transplant failure, long waiting lists, health
   insurance constraints, fraud, conspiracy, and increasing number of
   lawsuits. On the other hand, the TBO emerge with specific disadvantages.
   Medical risks are associated with the cell-scaffold interactions, TBO's
   sterility and the potential to replicate in vivo. New parametric
   standards are necessary to determine the TBO transplant's success or
   failure. Regulatory issues include the Coordinating Committee's current
   federal oversight limited for the commercial products. Rejoining of the
   NSF and NIH to the Coordination Committee would help expand the
   regulations to assess scientific novelty and upstream. Potential legal
   issues may include TBO patentability (matter, process, nonobviousness,
   novelty), patient's substantive due process rights of bodily integrity
   and TBO ownership under the 14th Amendment, advance directives for
   autopsy of a TBO carrier, and the extent of publishing an invention - a
   shared property between the scientist and the patient.},

Title = {Neighbourhood Effects on Jihadist Radicalisation in Germany? Some
   Case-Based Remarks},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {About twenty young people travelled from a small German former mining
   settlement named Dinslaken-Lohberg to become fighters with al-Nusra and
   ISIS. They drew particular attention, with media reports about
   ``members{''} of what they termed the ``Lohberg Brigade{''} killed in
   the fighting, or in air strikes by the anti-ISIS coalition, or in
   spectacular suicide attacks claiming many victims. Drawing on that case,
   the article explores how neighborhood can effect the emergence and
   persistence of radicalisation to jihadi neo-Salafism. The author
   presents a series of local elements that interfere with one another to
   strengthen each others persistence and effects and thus promote the
   emergence and persistence of the radicalisation phenomenon at hand.The
   interference of elements is not an automatic but a social process,
   enacted by neighbors telling stories of conspiracy, of discrimination
   and recounting experiences of spirituality, heroism, masculinity, and
   femaleness. It is performed by neighbors setting, crossing and avoiding
   symbolic boundaries. And finally it is played by neighbors simply
   following their routines. The author shows how explaining space-related
   radicalisation processes means more than adding up spatial factors. His
   approach rejects the idea of isolating a single social fact - such as
   local structures, events, processes or social actors that existed,
   occurred or acted prior to the emergence of radicals in their
   neighbourhood - as definite cause for radicalisation.},

Title = {How Social Media Machinery Pulled Mainstream Parenting Communities
   Closer to Extremes and Their Misinformation During Covid-19},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {2330-2344},
Abstract = {We reveal hidden social media machinery that has allowed misinformation
   to thrive among mainstream users, but which is missing from current
   policy discussions. Specifically, we show how mainstream parenting
   communities on Facebook have been subject to a powerful, two-pronged
   misinformation machinery during the pandemic, that has pulled them
   closer to extreme communities and their misinformation. The first prong
   involves a strengthening of the bond between mainstream parenting
   communities and pre-Covid conspiracy theory communities that promote
   misinformation about climate change, fluoride, chemtrails and 5G.
   Alternative health communities have acted as the critical conduits. The
   second prong features an adjacent core of tightly bonded, yet largely
   under-the-radar, anti-vaccination communities that continually supplied
   Covid-19 and vaccine misinformation to the mainstream parenting
   communities. Our findings show why Facebook's own efforts to post
   reliable information about vaccines and Covid-19 have not been
   efficient; why targeting the largest communities does not work; and how
   this machinery could generate new pieces of misinformation perpetually.
   We provide a simple yet exactly solvable mathematical theory for the
   system's dynamics. It predicts a new strategy for controlling mainstream
   community tipping points. Our conclusions should be applicable to any
   social media platform with in-built community features, and open up a
   new engineering approach to addressing online misinformation and other
   harms at scale.},

   Evidence from a Nationwide Online Experiment},
Journal = {VACCINES},

Abstract = {Although mass vaccination is the best way out of the pandemic, the share
   of skeptics is substantial in most countries. Social campaigns can
   emphasize the many arguments that potentially increase acceptance for
   vaccines: e.g., that they have been developed, tested, and recommended
   by doctors and scientists; and that they are safe, effective, and in
   demand. We verified the effectiveness of such messages in an online
   experiment conducted in February and March 2021 with a sample of almost
   six thousand adult Poles, which was nationally representative in terms
   of key demographic variables. We presented respondents with different
   sets of information about vaccinating against COVID-19. After reading
   the information bundle, they indicated whether they would be willing to
   be vaccinated. We also asked them to justify their answers and indicate
   who or what might change their opinion. Finally, we elicited a number of
   individual characteristics and opinions. We found that nearly 45\% of
   the respondents were unwilling to be vaccinated, and none of the popular
   messages we used was effective in reducing this hesitancy. We also
   observed a number of significant correlates of vaccination attitudes,
   with men, older, wealthier, and non-religious individuals, those with
   higher education, and those trusting science rather than COVID-19
   conspiracy theories being more willing to be vaccinated. We discuss
   important consequences for campaigns aimed at reducing COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy.},

Abstract = {During crises, the kind of information, people need and require differ
   due to a changing environment and personal situation. Covid-19
   represents a worldwide crisis, a pandemic. Already after the first
   Covid-19 cases occurred, more information was required. People all over
   the world are experiencing a new and difficult time which is formed by
   anxiety, insecurity, and passion. All media and channels are providing
   information about the situation, regulation, health advice, and personal
   interests. This amount of possible information can lead to information
   overload which in return has an effect towards information avoidance.
   However, also fake news and conspiracy theories get more and more
   attention. It is necessary to understand how people seek and evaluate
   information in different parts of the world. This study provides a first
   comparison of individuals' perception and behavior due to Covid-19 from
   different countries. All countries share aspects during this global
   health crisis, but there are also big differences: ``{[}...] each
   country has its unique political and social systems that affect
   information behavior and environments{''}. Therefore, as a follow up
   study to Dreisiebner, Marz, and Mandl, individuals from Germany and
   South America were asked through an online survey about their
   information provision confidence, information seeking behavior, media
   usage and handling of fake news during Covid-19. Furthermore, besides
   differences between the countries, behavioral changes are investigated.},

Title = {Disinformation about hydroxychlorochine on Twitter: from political

Abstract = {Introduction: scientific disinformation has been a strong ally
   responsible for making it increasingly difficult to cope with the
   disease caused by the new coronavirus. Negative views, conspiracy
   theories, political opportunism are some examples of malicious use
   behind the dissemination of information about the virus, its effects,
   forms of treatment and prevention. Method: it develops an
   infodemiological approch, and the research analyzes the
   prohydroxychloroquine message sharing on Twitter, the drug that has
   gained prominence when talking about possible pharmacological treatment
   of the disease. It collects data via Netlytic, by monitoring the hashtag
   \#hydroxychloroquine between 11th to 30th of May, and analyze it based
   on the social network analysis, the understanding of frequent terms and
   categorization of tweets. Results: It analyzes 3.714 tweets, and
   identifies 2.089 users. Only 678 users (32.4\%) maintained a connection
   with other users on the network. The frequent terms and their
   distribution indicate that the issue is played more by political aspects
   than by health, with a greater concentration of messages in a few users
   and a large number responsible for its viralization. The most common
   categories were ``Attack on political agents{''} and ``Disbelief in
   epistemic institutions.{''}. Conclusions: in the context studied, it is
   clear that the values of the scientific culture itself, such as
   recognition and authority, are gaining new informational layers in
   political dispute at a time when epistemic institutions are in decline.},

Abstract = {In the article, the phenomenon of multiculturalism is analyzed through
   the prism of different approaches to its understanding (dynamic and
   static) and the contradictions its implementation often entails (the
   lack of a coherent strategy, contradiction between individual and
   collective rights, culturalization of social discrepancies). The author
   scrutinizes the use of multiculturalism in right-wing and identitarian
   movements' discourse against the background of their exploitation of a
   negative image of migration and a migrant as a constituting Other. The
   author proves that, since populism is based on exploitation of
   narratives that cause emotional reaction of the audience,
   anti-immigration discourse is extremely relevant to the right-wing
   populist rhetoric. The author analyzes the conspiracy myths of ``great
   replacement{''} and ``Eurabia{''} that are juxtaposed to the
   multicultural myth; also, the alternative ethnopluralism
   (ethno-differentialism) theory comes under scrutiny. The latter is
   invoked by the European ``New Right{''}, followed by the right-wing
   populists and identitarianists, to justify the necessity of the growth
   of all cultures in the framework of different societies. The author
   concludes that, in spite of the existing contradictions,
   multiculturalism is still the most efficient strategy of ethnopolitical
   management. It will inevitably come to a clash with right-wing populist
   and identitarian discourses because of the very presence of the
   immigrants with different cultural background in the European countries.},

Journal = {LOGOS},

Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {51-90},
Abstract = {The controversy surrounding Heidegger's philosophical diaries (known as
   the Black Notebooks) is the last episode in a lengthy dispute that can
   be traced back nearly to the Third Reich. When the first three volumes
   were published in 2014, the debate was rekindled primarily by Emmanuel
   Faye's Heidegger: The Introduction of Nazism into Philosophy, which was
   by far the most virulent (although in some ways stimulating) book
   written against the master of Freiburg. Faye refused to regard Heidegger
   as a philosopher and accused him of instigating the Holocaust. However,
   until 2014 the broad consensus had been that the philosopher opposed
   Nazi biologism and anti-Semitism. With the publication of the first
   volumes of the Black Notebooks that interpretation became untenable for
   the vast majority of scholars, including some of the most fervent
   Heideggerians.
   Peter Trawny, the editor of those philosophical diaries, has insisted
   that they contain the notion of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy that was
   derived from The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Donatella di Cesare,
   former vice-president of the Heidegger Society, came up with the idea
   that Heidegger believed the Jews had exterminated themselves. Although
   Faye's book has certainly prompted the current controversy, it has been
   fueled and spread even more by massive use of the internet, which opens
   this cache of ``newly discovered evidence{''} to anyone interested.},

Title = {Revisiting the UK Muslim diasporic public sphere at a time of terror:
   from local (benign) invisible spaces to seditious conspiratorial spaces
   and the `failure of multiculturalism' discourse},
Journal = {SOUTH ASIAN DIASPORA},

Abstract = {Public exposes of hidden spaces where diasporic Muslims allegedly
   enunciate extreme anti-Western rhetoric or plot sedition, highlight an
   ironic shift from a time, analysed in my earlier work, when the
   Pakistani diasporic public sphere in Britain was invisible and local
   while nevertheless being regarded as relatively benign: a space of
   expressive rhetoric, ceremonial celebration and local power struggles.
   Suicide bombings on the London underground and revelations of aborted
   conspiracies have led to a national media debate in which Muslim
   `community' leaders for the first time have come to be active
   participants. They respond to accusations by politicians and journalists
   that multicultural tolerance has `failed' in Britain, and that national
   Muslim organisations are the prime cause of this alleged failure.
   Addressing this `failure of multiculturalism' discourse, the paper
   questions, first, whether talk of multiculturalism in the UK is really
   about `culture' at all? Second, the paper explores why Muslim
   integration into Britain the so-called success or failure of
   multiculturalism - has come to be `tested' by Muslim national leaders'
   willingness to attend Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations. The public
   dialogue reflecting on these issues in the mainstream and ethnic press,
   the paper proposes, highlights a signal development in the history of
   the UK Muslim diasporic public sphere: from being hidden and local to
   being highly visible and national, responsive to British politicians,
   investigative journalists and the wider British public.},

Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {78},
Number = {7},
Pages = {902-910},
Abstract = {The tactics used by the tobacco industry to resist government regulation
   of its products include conducting public relations campaigns, buying
   scientific and other expertise to create controversy about established
   facts, funding political parties, hiring lobbyists to influence policy,
   using front groups and allied industries to oppose tobacco control
   measures, pre-empting strong legislation by pressing for the adoption of
   voluntary codes or weaker laws, and corrupting public officials.
   Formerly secret internal tobacco industry documents provide evidence of
   a 50-year conspiracy to ``resist smoking restrictions, restore smoker
   confidence and preserve product liability defence{''}. The documents
   reveal industry-wide collusion on legal, political and socially
   important issues to the tobacco industry and clearly demonstrate that
   the industry is not disposed to act ethically or responsibly. Societal
   action is therefore required to ensure that the public health takes
   precedence over corporate profits. Recommendations for reducing the
   political influence of the tobacco industry include the following. Every
   tobacco company in every market should publicly disclose what it knew
   about the addictiveness and harm caused by tobacco, when it obtained
   this information, and what it did about it. The industry should be
   required to guarantee internationally recognized basic consumer rights
   to its customers. Trade associations and other industry groupings
   established to deceive the public should be disbanded. These
   recommendations should be incorporated into WHO's Framework Convention
   on Tobacco Control.},

   Experiences with Hate Speech and Threats},
Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 5},
Abstract = {We aimed to explore how many of the politically active, highly
   media-exposed, young survivors of the terrorist attack on Utoya island,
   Norway, have had personal experiences with hate speech and threats
   post-terror. Further, we aimed to examine the nature of these
   experiences, and the impact and consequences they have had for the
   directly affected. Approximately 8.5 years after the politically
   motivated terrorist attack on Utoya island in 2011, 289 survivors (51.2
   percent females, M age = 27.7, SD = 4.6) were interviewed about their
   personal experiences with hate speech and threats. Responses were
   systematically analyzed using thematic analysis. In total, ninety-nine
   participants (34 percent) had experienced hate speech and/or threats
   post-terror, of whom a majority believed that this was related to their
   status as a survivor of the attack. Thematically, the hate/threats
   mainly revolved around wishes that the survivors had died in the attack,
   death threats, support for the terrorist, severe accusations related to
   the attack, and conspiracy theories. This had affected the survivors
   both emotionally (e.g., inducing fear and anger, but also robustness)
   and behaviorally (e.g., social and political withdrawal). Immediate
   measures and long-term strategies need to be developed to mitigate the
   personal harm and threat to democracy that experiences with hate
   speech/threats may cause.},

   using machine learning},
Journal = {PNAS NEXUS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {At the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 became a global problem. Despite all
   the efforts to emphasize the relevance of preventive measures, not
   everyone adhered to them. Thus, learning more about the characteristics
   determining attitudinal and behavioral responses to the pandemic is
   crucial to improving future interventions. In this study, we applied
   machine learning on the multinational data collected by the
   International Collaboration on the Social and Moral Psychology of
   COVID-19 (N = 51,404) to test the predictive efficacy of constructs from
   social, moral, cognitive, and personality psychology, as well as
   socio-demographic factors, in the attitudinal and behavioral responses
   to the pandemic. The results point to several valuable insights.
   Internalized moral identity provided the most consistent predictive
   contribution-individuals perceiving moral traits as central to their
   self-concept reported higher adherence to preventive measures. Similar
   results were found for morality as cooperation, symbolized moral
   identity, self-control, open-mindedness, and collective narcissism,
   while the inverse relationship was evident for the endorsement of
   conspiracy theories. However, we also found a non-neglible variability
   in the explained variance and predictive contributions with respect to
   macro-level factors such as the pandemic stage or cultural region.
   Overall, the results underscore the importance of morality-related and
   contextual factors in understanding adherence to public health
   recommendations during the pandemic.},

Abstract = {Shortly after declaring war against Mexico in May of 1846, President
   James K. Polk appointed Jesuits John McElroy and Anthony Rey as
   chaplains for the U.S. invasion force. This appointment reflected two
   concerns of Polk: maintaining the morale of the Catholics who
   constituted a sizable portion of the regular army, and sending a signal
   that, in waging war against a Catholic country, the U.S. was not
   conducting an anti-Catholic crusade. Ironically, it was the U.S.
   Protestant establishment that viewed the appointments as a signal of
   Polk's collaboration in a papist conspiracy to undermine the American
   Republic, while McElroy and Rey conscientiously sought to exercise their
   ministry to the troops and serve as agents of good will. McElroy's age
   and inability to travel on horseback confined his ministry to the
   American base at Matamoros, while Rey accompanied the army as it made
   its way into Mexico's interior. With a virtual monopoly on ministry
   within the American forces, the two Jesuits assisted the ill and
   wounded, leading to scores of conversions among the largely Protestant
   volunteers. Within a few months, McElroy had serious doubts about their
   ability to fulfill Polk's charge of shaping public opinion, while the
   more youthful Rey retained an optimism that proved lethal. In the end,
   the McElroy-Rey mission had mixed results.},

Abstract = {The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted
   infection in the United States. Two vaccines have been approved to
   protect against the virus. Politicians have pushed for legislation to
   increase HPV vaccination rates and stop the spread of this
   cancer-causing disease. During the Republican presidential primary of
   2011, HPV vaccination mandates, which require young girls entering the
   6th grade to receive the vaccine, became a controversial issue. This
   study examined 167 unique blog posts on influential blog sites, in the
   wake of increased political attention to the issue of HPV vaccination
   mandates, to determine how the HPV vaccine is discussed online. Our
   analysis revealed significant differences in presentation of health
   information and general tone toward the vaccine between blog entries
   posted on different types of sites. Blog posts on political and general
   news sites were more negative toward the HPV vaccine than posts on
   health and science sites. On the issue of HPV vaccination mandates,
   bloggers seemed deeply divided, no matter the type of site. However,
   political and general news sites were more likely to highlight
   conspiracies between the government and vaccine manufacturers. Results
   show there is a considerable amount of debate regarding the HPV vaccine
   and HPV vaccination mandates in the blogosphere. Implications of the
   findings for vaccine risk communication are discussed.},

Abstract = {We present an analysis of terrorist propaganda using Al-Qaeda (AQ)
   between 1998 and 2008 as a case study using semiotic and propaganda
   analytic approaches. Our findings suggest AQ position themselves using a
   variety of propaganda techniques, especially on the notion of a global
   conspiracy, an existential threat, against Islam. Their key contribution
   to the evolution of conflict has been to emancipate the political
   marketing/public relations component and, thus, to redefine the essence
   of conflict. AQ design sophisticated propaganda, use segmented message
   design and have improved their production values over time. They have
   also crudely attempted to influence Western European and US elections.
   The authors conclude that AQ's positioning strategy is based on framing
   a death-centred militant worldview as its precise opposite, a pious life
   of struggle with rewards in the afterlife. This article makes
   descriptive and methodological contributions to the interdisciplinary
   literature on propaganda. It makes a contribution by explaining how AQ's
   positioning strategy evolved between 1998 and 2008, an analysis which
   will be of particular interest to those who seek to understand the wider
   societal applications of terrorist use of propaganda and who seek to
   counter its effects. It makes a further methodological contribution by
   providing an integrated method by which to evaluate propaganda, using a
   combination of semiotic, content and propaganda analysis approaches.},

   1885-1918},

Abstract = {This article examines Irish nationalist attitudes towards electoral
   reform between 1885 and 1918. It argues that before 1917 mainstream
   Irish nationalist opinion attached little importance to the franchise,
   being instead more concerned about the consequences for home rule if the
   number of Irish parliamentary seats was reduced through redistribution.
   However, the introduction of wartime legislation to reform the franchise
   and registration system repoliticized electoral reform in nationalist
   Ireland. While the Irish parliamentary party vociferously protested at
   the coalition governments belated attempt to redistribute Irish
   constituencies, its critics (a coalition of heterodox nationalists,
   socialists, and suffragettes) accused it of deliberately conspiring to
   exclude Ireland from the `fourth' reform bill because the young men and
   women it would enfranchise intended to vote for Sinn Fein. This article
   argues that the concerns of the Irish party regarding redistribution
   were genuine and legitimate, while the conspiracy theory was essentially
   a propaganda device. None the less, the theory gained widespread
   attention because its underlying assumption about the voting behaviour
   of the new electorate was shared not only by its exponents, but by
   sections of the press, the British administration in Ireland, and the
   Irish party itself Indeed, so convinced was the party that the cleavage
   in Ireland was as much generational as ideological that ultimately the
   franchise was a factor in its defeat at the 1918 general election.},

Title = {Assessment of bidirectional transformer encoder model and attention
   based bidirectional LSTM language models for fake news detection},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {76},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Fake news arouses to be untrue with the point of deceiving it openly
   which is now viewed as the greatest threat to society by cultivating the
   political division and doubts in government. Since this kind of news is
   disseminated in sheer volume through social media, driving the
   improvement of strategies for the recognizable proof of false news is
   necessary. Therefore, this study focuses on text analytics to derive the
   hidden properties of stylistic content to detect fake and real news. An
   erudite literature study of fake news detection diverted towards issues
   such as attention, context, and parallelization. In this same direction,
   the assessment evaluates the sequential memory-based deep learning model
   in comparison to the parallel memory-based deep learning model. For
   sequential, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-Directional LSTM, and
   Attention-based Bi-directional LSTM are taken into consideration.
   Besides, for parallel, the transformer-based BERT model is examined. To
   identify the efficacy of applied approaches, four datasets are taken
   from diverse domains such as political news, entertainment news, satire
   news, conspiracy news, and global pandemic news. The experimental
   analysis of real-world information demonstrates that the pre-trained
   transformer encoder-based BERT model outperforms with a quite
   significant margin of improvement. Also, as inspected Attention-based
   Bi-directional approach provides state-of-the-art results with good
   training accuracy.},

Title = {Demographic, structural, and psychological predictors of risk-increasing
   and mask wearing behaviors among US adults between December 2020-March
   2021},
Journal = {PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {114},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives: To assess demographic, structural, and psychological
   predictors of risk-increasing and risk-decreasing behaviorsMethods: This
   study used data from an online longitudinal, three-wave COVID-19 survey
   (12/20-03/21) regarding the behaviors, attitudes, and experiences of US
   Veteran (n = 584) and non-Veteran (n = 346) adults.Results: Inability to
   get groceries delivered emerged as the strongest predictor of more
   frequent risk-increasing behavior across all timepoints. Other
   consistent predictors of more frequent risk-increasing behavior and less
   frequent mask wearing included less worry about getting COVID-19,
   disbelief in science, belief in COVID-19 conspiracies, and negative
   perceptions of the state response. No demographic factor consistently
   predicted risk-increasing behavior or mask wearing, though different
   demographic predictors emerged for more frequent risk-increasing
   behaviors (e.g., lower health literacy) and mask-wearing (e.g., older
   age and urban residence) at certain timepoints. The most frequently
   endorsed reasons for having contact with others concerned health
   -related (food, medical care, and exercise) and social needs (seeing
   friends/family and boredom). Conclusions: These findings highlight key
   individual-level determinants of risk-increasing behaviors and mask
   wearing which encompass demographic, structural, and psychological
   factors. Practice Implications: Findings can support public health
   experts and health communicators promote engagement with risk-reducing
   behaviors and address key barriers to engaging in these behaviors.},

Title = {The search for alternative knowledge in the post-truth era: Anti-vaccine
   mobilization during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey},
Journal = {COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES},

Abstract = {The search for alternative knowledge, conspiracy theories, distrust of
   expertise and anti-science movements are gaining momentum and post-truth
   populism is speeding up on the back of fake news. The crisis of truth
   refers to an era where evidence and objective facts get lost in
   sentiment, emotion, and personal beliefs. Relying on emotions,
   creationism, religious beliefs, and common sense over expertise
   deliberately creates counter-knowledge referred to as pseudo-science,
   troll-science or fake-science. As the worth of scientific expertise is
   devalued, the counter-scientific discourses supported through populist
   political rhetoric help to produce a culture of resistance to science.
   Our qualitative content analysis of Twitter posts along with the news
   regarding anti-vaccine arguments from two selected online news sites,
   revealed three major themes, which we referred to as strategies used by
   the COVID-19 vaccine deniers in Turkey to disseminate their views. These
   were: an emphasis on bodily freedom and personal choice and the use of
   ``my body my choice{''} rhetoric; the denying, devaluing, and shifting
   of scientific evidence; and the dismissal and/or attacking of
   alternative views and the deepening of the polarisation between the
   supporters of the COVID-19 restrictions, vaccine supporters and deniers.
   We conclude the paper by arguing that there is a link between the
   distrust of doctors and the anti-vaccination ideas, and the quest for
   alternative knowledge and expert authority.},

Title = {Sentinel node approach to monitoring online COVID-19 misinformation},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Understanding how different online communities engage with COVID-19
   misinformation is critical for public health response. For example,
   misinformation confined to a small, isolated community of users poses a
   different public health risk than misinformation being consumed by a
   large population spanning many diverse communities. Here we take a
   longitudinal approach that leverages tools from network science to study
   COVID-19 misinformation on Twitter. Our approach provides a means to
   examine the breadth of misinformation engagement using modest data needs
   and computational resources. We identify a subset of accounts from
   different Twitter communities discussing COVID-19, and follow these
   `sentinel nodes' longitudinally from July 2020 to January 2021. We
   characterize sentinel nodes in terms of a linked domain preference
   score, and use a standardized similarity score to examine alignment of
   tweets within and between communities. We find that media preference is
   strongly correlated with the amount of misinformation propagated by
   sentinel nodes. Engagement with sensationalist misinformation topics is
   largely confined to a cluster of sentinel nodes that includes
   influential conspiracy theorist accounts. By contrast, misinformation
   relating to COVID-19 severity generated widespread engagement across
   multiple communities. Our findings indicate that misinformation
   downplaying COVID-19 severity is of particular concern for public health
   response. We conclude that the sentinel node approach can be an
   effective way to assess breadth and depth of online misinformation
   penetration.},

Abstract = {This article considers the importance of Al-Qaeda and Pakistan in
   driving British Islamic extremist terrorism during the past decade.
   Between 2003 and 2013, almost 50 British-born Muslims engaged in
   multiple high-profile terrorism conspiracies. All were designed to kill
   or seriously injure British citizens. Drawing on recently obtained court
   transcripts which offer remarkable detail, these plots are analysed from
   the point of view of radicalization, finance, training and operational
   direction. The emergence of extremist terrorism in the UK has its
   genesis within the Islamic fundamentalist movement, a socio-political
   ideology that arrived in London in the early 1990s. Contrary to the
   prevailing discourse, members of the movement constitute a far from
   homogenous set of individuals. Based on age, overseas connections,
   experience of conflict and religiosity, they each fulfill diverse tasks
   that range from preaching and fundraising to facilitating combative
   jihad. A minority adopted an extremist position that led them to carry
   out acts of terrorism. Since 2006, the role of Al-Qaeda and Pakistan in
   relation to this process has steadily declined. For the past seven years
   British Islamic extremists have pursued terrorism in whatever way they
   can on their own, with little or any direct support or influence from
   overseas. The security agencies are now asking how far current events in
   Syria will overturn this state of affairs.},

Abstract = {A cultural approach to the study of the French Revolution took off in
   the 1980s as a result of the coincidence of new intellectual and
   political currents with celebrations of the Revolution's bicentennial.
   By the turn of the new century, both the study of cultural phenomena
   (theatre, art and architecture, fashion, etc.) before, during, and after
   1789 and an approach to social and political upheaval that stressed
   symbolism and the production of meaning had thoroughly remade mainstream
   understandings of this vital period in modern history. But a backlash
   was already underway. This article explores, first, the emergence and
   flourishing of the so-called cultural turn in French revolutionary
   studies between the 1980s and the present, including recent work on the
   study of race and gender, emotion, experience, violence, and conspiracy
   thinking. It then investigates the equally recent critiques that this
   approach has generated, especially among those interested in rethinking
   economic questions from a post- or modified Marxist perspective and/or
   decentering France in conceptions of modernity. The author hypothesizes
   that contemporary challenges to democracy in Europe, the United States,
   and elsewhere around the globe should, and will, lead to new questions
   both about what happened in France at the close of the eighteenth
   century and about how we should write about this moment of upheaval
   going forward.},

Abstract = {The Russian author Ivan S. Turgenev became a ``pass to Europe{''} of a
   kind to the American, Henry James, in that he introduced the latter to
   the first-rate Parisian literary circles. James read Turgenev in German
   and French (despite existing English translations) and included him as
   the only foreigner in his book French Poets and Novelists (1878)
   together with Baudelaire, Balzac, Sand, Flaubert, Merimee, etc. At the
   same time, the question of Turgenev's national identity is a recurring
   topic of Jamesian essays. In these essays, Turgenev is at once European
   and non-European: an acknowledged European author yet belonging to the
   culture that represents European otherness, as it were. Eventually, he
   is a non-existing American classic: a novelist who, according to James,
   would have been a great American writer if born in the American South.
   This essay scrutinizes the question of Turgenev's national identity and
   his ``Europeanness{''} on the material of Jamesian essays belonging to
   different genres: reviews, a mortuary, and an encyclopedic article. It
   also shows how James attempts to ``Europeanize{''} Turgenev by remaking
   his novel Virgin Soil. His own novel, Princess Casamassima considered
   imitative by many critics, not only transfers the conspiracy plot to
   Europe but rewrites it according to the rules that James associated with
   Western European literary tradition.},

   motives are characterized, based on which Petritsi translated the odes

   urged the Poles to start a war with Muscovite state. On the other hand,
   it once again ``raised from the dead{''} the Tsar False Dmitry I killed

   Polish aristocrats, who came to the wedding of Marina Mnishek. Attention
   is drawn to the fact that the first in the history of Slavic literature
   complete translation of the lyric works of Horace was carried out with
   the support of the family Mnishek and dedicated to them by the author.
   It is concluded that it can serve as a valuable historical source for
   the psychological characteristics of the Polish participants in the
   events of the Time of Troubles.},

Abstract = {In this paper we argue for a unified semantics for hypothetical
   conditionals, hcs, e.g. if it rains, we'll cancel the picnic, and
   biscuit conditionals, bcs, e.g., if you are hungry, there are biscuits
   on the sideboard. We side with recent literature in proposing that
   differences in the interpretation are related to (in)dependence between
   antecedent and consequent, but we move beyond current accounts in
   spelling out a characterization of independence that is actually
   predictive. We further establish a systematic link between
   if-constructions and discourse structure, providing a dynamic update
   model that integrates the QUD, and thus the intentional
   discourse-structure. We argue that in bcs the antecedent sets up the
   question that is addressed by the consequent, and show that rescuing
   (Gricean) relevance in face of independence gives rise to implicatures
   corresponding to the different flavors associated with bcs. Crucially,
   we argue, this is the same mechanism responsible for our understanding
   that in the hc above, for example, it is the rain that will cause the
   cancellation of the picnic. Along the way we notice how the phenomena
   observed in if-constructions are also replicated in other
   quantificational structures. Ultimately, there is not much that is
   biscuit-specific. Their interpretation is the result of a conspiracy
   among semantics, dynamic update and intentional discourse-structure.},

Abstract = {Given that wolves have been extinct in Germany for approximately 150
   years, their return and growing population over the last decade has
   caused intense discussion and conflict. To develop a widely accepted and
   just coexistence between humans and wolves, a comprehensive
   understanding of the conflict is needed. There are indications that the
   conflict goes beyond dealing with the wolf population and marks a
   spatial-cultural divide between urban and rural areas. Nevertheless, the
   social dimensions of the human-wolf conflict in Germany have been little
   studied. The aim of this paper is to narrow this gap by means of a media
   discourse analysis including reader comments in order to provide
   insights into the constituent elements of this conflict. We conducted a
   qualitative content analysis. The sample comprises articles (n = 63) and
   reader comments (n = 515) over a period of one year (5/2018-5/2019) from
   six online periodicals in Germany. The results support the assumption of
   an urban-rural divide in terms of perspectives and values. The discourse
   indicates that rural actors who are most affected by the wolves'
   vicinity have more negative attitudes towards them. At the same time,
   they feel abandoned and dominated by urban perspectives and politics. In
   addition, linkages to right-wing populist positions and conspiracy
   narratives that can be interpreted as a consequence of political
   alienation are found.},

Abstract = {Document falsification is among the fastest growing problems all over
   the world. Disclosure of such document is not always possible due to the
   conspiracy of attorney bodies; especially legal documents such as bank
   cheques, contracts, cash memos, and so on. Handwritten document
   tampering detection due to addition of new word(s) in judicial documents
   is the prime objective of this research. Minute alteration in writing
   causes financial loss to a person or to an organization and decreases
   the global economy. Such intangible assets remain undiscovered owing to
   lack of proper forensic techniques. Though writing style imitation can
   be possible, however, the possibility of getting exactly the same pen of
   the authorized document is quite impossible for an imitator. Hence, the
   paper introduces a solution to detect forgery in handwritten legal
   documents by analyzing perceptually similar pen ink. Forgery activity
   happens either ends of a written document by appending new
   word(s)/letter(s) with similar type of pen. The work is formulated as a
   binary classification problem and established with the help of several
   statistical features and three different classifiers: Multilayer
   Perceptron(MLP), RBF-SVM, and Random Forest(RF). Besides, the problem
   has also been implemented through some DCNN approaches to check whether
   it is possible to reflect the forgery by direct approaches. The
   efficiency of the proposed method is quite promising for involvement in
   the examination of forensic documents.},

Abstract = {This article identifies how and why Argentine political rumors were
   created, spread, and legitimized by government officials, military
   officers and the press in the interwar years. In that period, the
   practice of what we now call ``fake news{''}-known as pescado podrido
   (rotten fish) in Argentina for it poisons the one who hears or repeats
   it-became more common and took on international proportions. In
   Argentina, a variety of forces drove the increase in disinformation,
   including political instability, the rising (and later the banning) of
   the majoritarian Radical Party, elite anxiety about the threat of
   communism, and a long-lasting nationalist fear about the integrity of
   borders. Authorities and right-wing politicians were inclined to see any
   anti-government actions as linked to international communism and, in
   some cases, imaginary Jewish conspiracies. The article offers two case
   studies: One refers to the anti-Radical Party rumors, especially those
   spread in the days immediately before and after the coup d'etat in 1930;
   and the other to a more generalized atmosphere of anti-communist
   inspired rumors and fake news in the interwar period. This article is
   based on research in government archives and newspaper collections in
   Patagonian cities, Buenos Aires, and Washington, D.C. Argentine official
   sources included records from the Ministry of the Interior, the
   Gobernacion del Neuquen, President Agustin P. Justo's papers and
   recently declassified army and navy documents.},

Abstract = {The Spanish Civil War saw an outburst of antisemitism in the
   Nationalist-controlled areas of the peninsula and in the Moroccan
   protectorate, an antisemitism influenced by the work of ultra-right-wing
   intellectuals associated with the Accion Espanola review. All the
   factions of the Nationalist camp interpreted the civil war as a crusade
   against the `Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevist' conspiracy. In mainland Spain,
   where there were only a few Jewish families, antisemifism was largely
   confined to the written word. In this way, it was used mostly as a
   rhetorical tool to attack the Nationalists' real and imaginary enemies:
   the Republican forces, the French and the Soviets. Although there was no
   systemic persecution of the Jews, some aggressive acts took place in
   Seville and Barcelona. The situation of the larger Jewish community in
   Spanish Morocco was quite different. The Moroccan Jews were adversely
   affected by the Nationalists' efforts to enlist the support of the
   Muslim population against the Republicans and by the German presence in
   the protectorate. They were also victimized by the Falangists who
   confiscated their property and imposed heavy fines on them. The military
   authorities of Morocco tried to restrain these excesses as they realized
   that blatant antisemitism could hurt the rebels' image abroad. They also
   believed that Jewish wealth and connections could serve the Nationalist
   cause.},

Title = {Can Fake News Detection Models Maintain the Performance through Time? A
   Longitudinal Evaluation of Twitter Publications},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {The negative impact of false information on social networks is rapidly
   growing. Current research on the topic focused on the detection of fake
   news in a particular context or event (such as elections) or using data
   from a short period of time. Therefore, an evaluation of the current
   proposals in a long-term scenario where the topics discussed may change
   is lacking. In this work, we deviate from current approaches to the
   problem and instead focus on a longitudinal evaluation using social
   network publications spanning an 18-month period. We evaluate different
   combinations of features and supervised models in a long-term scenario
   where the training and testing data are ordered chronologically, and
   thus the robustness and stability of the models can be evaluated through
   time. We experimented with 3 different scenarios where the models are
   trained with 15-, 30-, and 60-day data periods. The results show that
   detection models trained with word-embedding features are the ones that
   perform better and are less likely to be affected by the change of
   topics (for example, the rise of COVID-19 conspiracy theories).
   Furthermore, the additional days of training data also increase the
   performance of the best feature/model combinations, although not very
   significantly (around 2\%). The results presented in this paper build
   the foundations towards a more pragmatic approach to the evaluation of
   fake news detection models in social networks.},

Abstract = {Our objective was to analyze the sources, characteristics, tone, and
   content of the most viewed YouTube videos in Spanish about Covid-19
   vaccines. In February 2021, a search was carried out on YouTube using
   the terms ``Vacuna Covid,{''} ``Vacuna coronavirus,{''} and ``Vacuna
   Covid19.{''} Associations between tone, source, and others variables
   (e.g. number of views or dislikes) were studied with a Mann-Whitney
   U-test and a chi-square test. A total of 118 videos were analyzed;
   63.6\% were originated from Mexico and the USA; media created 57.6\% of
   the videos. Positive tone was observed in 53.4\%. The most discussed
   topics were target groups for vaccination (38.9\%) and safety (43.2\%).
   The 68 videos produced by media accumulated 31,565,295 views (55.0\% of
   views), and the 19 videos created by health professionals obtained
   10,742,825 views (18.7\% of views). A significantly smaller number of
   likes was obtained in videos of media compared to those created by
   health professionals (p = .004). Videos made by health professionals,
   compared to those of media, showed a greater positive tone (OR = 3.09).
   Hoaxes/conspiracy theories were identified in 1.7\% of the videos.
   Monitoring that the information on YouTube about Covid-19 vaccines is
   reliable should be a central part of Covid-19 vaccination campaigns.},

Abstract = {In this paper the author objective is to discuss models that express
   what occurs in the analytical situation. He demonstrates how early
   models relating to painting and sculpture, to history and archaeology,
   develop into other models that refer to the relationship between two
   people. He studies in depth the Barangers' `analytical field' with its
   obstructive bastions as a background to understanding what is currently
   valued as intersubjectivity in psychoanalysis. The container-contained
   model and the phenomenon of `recruitment' are also discussed. The author
   uses clinical material to demonstrate how these models are linked to
   `enactment', and a study of this concept provides evidence of the
   importance of the visual image, the dream and `non-dream', the
   `affective pictogram', as privileged aspects for the understanding and
   evolution of thought in the analytical process. Its importance leads to
   a proposal of a model that uses the theatre as a metaphor for the
   analytical process. In this model, analyst and patient both participate
   as characters in the scenes, and simultaneously as their co-authors. The
   analyst should also be responsible for the direction of scenes, as well
   as acting as critic. His task is to prevent obstructive conspiracies
   (the `non-dream') and find new meanings for the scenes, thus allowing
   the development of new scenes and plots, and the enlarging of the mental
   universe.},

Abstract = {This article is a response to the paper that discloses the unwillingness
   to get vaccination against Covid-19 as based on the apocalyptic
   mentality. This topic is extended so that I analyse not only subjective
   but also objective reasons for the phenomenon which in the
   above-mentioned paper is termed vaccinophobia. I go even further and
   examine not only the consequences but also the cause, i.e. the pandemic
   itself and the various aspects of its impact on society and religion. I
   argue that the understanding of Covid is possible not only in the domain
   of doctors, sociologists, politologists, but also of theologians. I
   study the following main directions of its impact, i.e. being the
   instument used to destroy the traditional historical, cultural, and even
   biological identity of present-day Westerners; abnormal control over
   society on the pretext of caring for people, and extreme pressure on
   church life under the same pretext. My conclusion is that it is possible
   to see analogies between the fine tuning of Creation and coordination of
   the factors listed above in the context of the pervading purposeful set
   of objectives which are initially oppossed to the divine plan and are
   becoming more and more sophisticated. I cite opinions of prominent
   virusologists about the artificial origin of Covid as well as the
   arguments in favour of the view that the Christian teaching about hell
   can no longer be seen as a remnant of Middle Ages but constitutes an
   integral part of the Christian doctrine and fully retains validity in
   the present day.},

Journal = {VACCINE: X},
Year = {2022},

Number = {SI},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {During pregnancy, women are at an increased risk of getting sick from
   respiratory viruses and when compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant
   women are more susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19. Owing to
   this fact and the emergence of a more infectious COVID-19 variants,
   pregnant women are currently classified as a vulnerable population,
   along with pediatric patients and older adults. While scientists are
   still learning more about the new variants, it is becoming clear that
   COVID-19 infected pregnant women are also at a real increased risk of
   poor pregnancy outcomes, as premature birth and babies born with
   lifelong health issues are possible if people become infected during
   pregnancy. Added to these facts, recommendation for COVID-19 has largely
   varied globally. The conspiracy-laden information on social media has
   led to pregnant women being hesitant about getting COVID-19 vaccine.
   Furthermore, as the transmissibility of COVID-19 is higher with this
   variant and the health system for maternal care in many countries
   regarded as ``very bad{''} there is need to clearly highlight the
   impacts of the variants and for countries to speed up vaccination
   programme to reach all members of society. (c) 2022 Published by

Abstract = {As the core of blockchain technology, consensus mechanism determines the
   security, stability and availability of the system. Most of consensus
   mechanism including Po-X, X-BFT and so on mainly focuses on the design
   and improvement of the consensus layer, ignoring the impact of the
   communication mechanism on consensus efficiency and the privacy
   protection of the consensus node. It leads to the emergence of node
   corruption and conspiracy attacks. In this paper, we present MACT, a new
   multi-channel anonymous consensus mechanism for consortium blockchain.
   MACT uses anonymous communication mechanism, based on Onion Routing
   Technology Tor, to protect node privacy and prevent the corruption of
   consensus nodes. To reduce the computational power consumption, MACT
   abandons the traditional attempt conversion and mining mechanism, and
   adopts double ring threshold signature. Besides, to achieve the cross
   chain management of alliance members as well as the privacy protection
   of the branch chain ledgers, we improve the distributed ledger of MACT
   based on directed acyclic graph technology(DAG). Additionally, we design
   a set of identity authentication mechanism NKC for MACT based on the
   improved Keberos protocol, which is completely independent of the third
   party public key infrastructure, reduces the probability of Byzantine
   nodes to a certain extent. The experiment results demonstrate that MACT
   can achieve anonymous consensus and has good consensus efficiency.},

Title = {Venezuelan education in times of war},
Journal = {EDUCAR EM REVISTA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Abstract = {This essay characterizes in a general way the unilateral and coercive
   actions against Venezuela, promoted in these last two decades by the
   governments of the United States (USA) and its impact on social public
   policies, specifically educational ones. Emphasis is placed on this
   descriptive - analytical effort, on the measures taken by the Obama -
   Trump administration, the effects of which have been devastating for the
   country's economy, with clear consequences on the daily life of the
   Venezuelan people. The purpose of such actions of war, inscribed in the
   political doctrine of ``regime change{''}, has been to create
   disaffection and rejection of society towards the country's political
   leadership and the Bolivarian political project, to facilitate the
   aforementioned agenda. The U.S. government He has used the complicity of
   the Organization of American States (OAS), as well as the conspiracy of
   governments of countries in the region gathered in the self-proclaimed
   ``Lima Group{''} poster, whose characteristic features are their
   obedience and submission to political-ideological guidelines of the
   ultraconservative sectors of the USA in power and its corporate allies
   outside it. Hence, some features of the social policy of the Bolivarian
   Revolution are glimpsed, emphasizing educational policy in times of
   deepening of the class struggle whose expression is the hybridization of
   the war against the Bolivarian project.},

Title = {Top quark and neutrino composite Higgs bosons},
Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {73},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the context of top-quark condensation models, the top quark alone is
   too light to saturate the correct value of the electroweak scale by its
   condensate. Within the seesaw scenario the neutrinos can have their
   Dirac masses large enough so that their condensates can provide a
   significant contribution to the value of the electroweak scale. We
   address the question of a phenomenological feasibility of the top-quark
   and neutrino condensation conspiracy against the electroweak symmetry.
   It is mandatory to reproduce the masses of electroweak gauge bosons, the
   top-quark mass and the recently observed scalar mass of 125 GeV and to
   satisfy the upper limits on absolute value of active neutrino masses. To
   accomplish that we design a reasonably simplified effective model with
   two composite Higgs doublets. Additionally, we work with a general
   number N of right-handed neutrino flavor triplets participating on the
   seesaw mechanism. There are no experimental constraints limiting this
   number. The upper limit is set by the model itself. Provided that the
   condensation scale is of order 10(17-18) GeV and the number of
   right-handed neutrinos is O(100-1000), the model predicts masses of
   additional Higgs bosons below 250 GeV and a suppression of the top-quark
   Yukawa coupling to the 125 GeV particle at the similar to 60 \% level of
   the Standard model value.},

Abstract = {Antisemitism and the myth of the Jewish World Conspiracy were important
   and pervasive ideologies of the turbulent interwar period. Across the
   globe, antisemitism was a powerful expression of the growing insecurity
   felt by millions in a world racked by crisis and instability. Among
   those attracted to antisemitism was New Zealander Arthur Nelson Field.
   A.N. Field developed his radical anti-Jewish views in response to the
   shock of the Great Depression. From 1931, when he published his
   best-selling book The truth about the Slump, Field developed a solid
   reputation in New Zealand and internationally as a leading antisemitic
   agitator. In his writings Field sought to provide explanation for the
   causes of the first world war, the decline of the British Empire and the
   origins of the Great Depression. Although his influence has been
   generally overlooked, the study of Field's life reveals much about New
   Zealand's political culture during the 1930s and the character of
   antisemitism as an international ideology. This article offers an
   examination of Field's life and work, his development as an antisemite
   and an assessment of his influence in New Zealand and internationally.
   The article argues that while Field was an extraordinary individual, his
   political development as an antisemite was not completely out of
   character with the period and reflected many of the fears and anxieties
   felt by New Zealanders during the Great Depression.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 prevention measures including lockdowns, school closures, and
   restricted movement disrupted young people's lives. This longitudinal
   qualitative study conducted in Soweto, South Africa aimed to explore
   young people's knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, vaccination, and
   the impact of infections. A convenience sample of 30 young black people
   (n = 15 men; n = 15 women, aged 16-21 years) from Soweto participated in
   24 focus group discussions (FGDs), conducted in six phases - each phase
   had four FGDs stratified by gender and age. Young people's understanding
   of COVID-19 deepened throughout the study, however, did not always
   translate into adherence (following the government's COVID-19 prevention
   measures). Although deemed inadequate, TV and radio were preferred over
   internet COVID-19 information. Parents, teachers, and schools were
   trusted sources of information. Vaccines and limited access to
   information attributed to low-risk perception, while new COVID-19
   variants attributed to high-risk perception. A low-risk perception and
   conspiracy theories contributed to non-adherence (disregarding COVID-19
   preventative measures provided by the government), particularly among
   young men. Accessing reliable information that considers young people's
   lives and their living context is important. Communities, scientists,
   and policymakers must learn from the COVID-19 experience and implement
   localised preventive strategies for education, awareness, and economic
   support in future emergencies.},

Abstract = {On 10 July 1941, Jewish inhabitants of the little town of Jedwabne were
   burnt alive in a barn by their Polish neighbors. This was probably the
   worst act of violence inflicted on Jews by the Poles during World War
   II. By examining postwar legal proceedings related to the Jedwabne
   massacre, this article looks at the attitude of Polish authorities
   towards crimes committed by the Poles on Jews during the war as well as
   the reaction of the local community to its own dark past. Although a
   group of perpetrators were put on trial in 1949 and 1953, criminal court
   files reveal the indolence and ineffectiveness of Communist Poland's
   justice in such cases. The documents also expose a conspiracy of silence
   among residents of Jedwabne and their solidarity with the defendants. On
   the other hand, a scrutiny of civil court proceedings discloses
   mechanisms of appropriation of the victims' property by the
   perpetrators. An analysis of a subsequent investigation into the
   Jedwabne case carried out in the 1960s and 1970s proves that it
   predominantly aimed at erasing the truth about Polish involvement in the
   crime, and as its result German gendarmes were officially pointed out as
   the sole culprits. Only after the restitution of democracy in 1989 was
   Poland able to openly confront black pages of its history including the
   Jedwabne massacre.},

   Meaning out of Politics in an Era of Distrust and Isolation},
Journal = {KOLNER ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE UND SOZIALPSYCHOLOGIE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 8},
Abstract = {This paper examines how working-class young adults construct their
   political identities in the wake of the decline of mediating
   institutions such as stable work, unions, nuclear family structures, and
   religion. The transition to adulthood has become deinstitutionalized as
   leaving home, finishing school, finding a good job, and getting married
   and having children seem increasingly out of reach for contemporary
   young adults. In the absence of institutionalized rites of passage,
   respondents must create, within their constraints, the story or
   narrative in terms of which their lives make sense. Through in-depth
   interviews with young working-class residents of a declining coal town
   in northeastern Pennsylvania, I trace how young adults construct
   narratives that make connections between economic decline, emotional
   despair, and political realignment. While working-class young adults may
   inherit political beliefs from their parents, growing up in a time of
   economic precarity and social division has the potential to disrupt
   older allegiances and prompt the creation of new identities and social
   solidarities. I demonstrate how individual strategies for managing
   suffering organize the young working-class self in ways that justify
   disengagement from conventional politics and a turn toward self-help and
   conspiracy theories. I also explore differences within the sample by
   racial identity and gender identity, tracing how different histories of
   oppression and differing expectations of moral self-worth possibly
   contribute to the political realm.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study assesses misconceptions about coronavirus disease
   2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and the factors associated with misconception
   among Jordanians. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was
   conducted. The survey was formulated on Google Forms, and was hosted on
   an online platform. These questions were created based on extensive
   review of online information about the vaccines. Frequencies and
   percentages (\%) were used for categorical variables, while means and
   standard deviations (SDs) were used for continuous variables. Stepwise
   binary logistic regression was conducted to evaluate variables
   associated with participant's misconception questions. Results: Of 1195
   survey respondents who participated in the study, 41.3\% had received
   the COVID-19 vaccine. The mean misconception score was (60.0 +/- 19.1).
   The statement with the highest mean was ``The vaccine hasn't been tested
   on enough people{''} (3.6 +/- 1.0). The statement with the lowest mean
   was ``The COVID-19 vaccine includes a microchip to control us{''} (2.2
   +/- 1.1) in the conspiracy theory portion. Females, 18- to 29-age group,
   higher educational level, living in a city, the participants who took
   lectures about the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccinated participants had
   higher odds of being in the low misconception level group. Conclusion:
   Targeted campaigns and vaccine safety information should be part of a
   broader health education campaign to alleviate vaccination safety
   concerns.},

Abstract = {With the upcoming technologies available for hacking text based
   passwords, there is a need to provide users with a secure environment
   that protect their resources against unauthorized access by enforcing
   control mechanisms. To counteract the increasing threat, Image Based
   Authentication (IBA) has been introduced. Apart from being more secure
   than usual text based passwords, IBA has proved to be an asset as it is
   user friendly. IBA generally encapsulates the Needham Schroeder Protocol
   (NSP) and provides client a completely unique and secured authentication
   tool to work on. This paper however proposes a hypothesis regarding the
   use of Needham Schroeder Protocol and is a comprehensive study on the
   subject of using images as the password set. This forms the basis for a
   secure communication between the communicating entities. The assortment
   of image set as client's password set aims at thwarting reply attacks.
   The paper also evaluates the performance of this method in terms of its
   efficiency and time taken. Password authentication protocols are
   important mean of user authentication on network. Several password
   authentication protocols have been introduced each claiming to withstand
   to the several attacks, including replay, password file compromise,
   denial of service, etc. Then, we present an improvement to the
   Needham-Schroeder Protocol, in order to remove two possible attacks.
   Therefore, the proposed scheme is secure and efficient against notorious
   conspiracy attacks.},

Abstract = {In 2004, the Feminist Press (CU, New York) selected Evelyn Piper's 1957
   novel Bunny Lake is Missing to be part of a series of reissues entitled
   `Femme Fatales: Women Write Pulp'. Piper's best-selling novel was chosen
   for its place in a lost or forgotten tradition of `queens of pulp'. This
   essay explores what it means for historical pulp fiction written by
   women to offer the contemporary reader `subversive perspectives on the
   heart of the American century'. Exploring first the feminist reclamation
   of pulp fiction, a detailed analysis is made of the cultural valency of
   Piper's narrative of a single mother's desperate search for her missing
   child. Exploring the `conspiracy of disbelief' that Piper's female
   protagonist confronts when her child's existence is constructed as
   delusional, the matter of how a `transgressive' popular fiction - that
   positions a woman as its active agent - is adapted for the screen is
   raised through comparison with Otto Preminger's 1965 cinematic
   adaptation of Bunny Lake is Missing. In its original written form, the
   subject is a potent one for exposing the ideologically disruptive figure
   of the unstable single mother within the patriarchal confines of 50s
   urban America while Preminger's film might be read as a repudiation of
   the political value to feminism of the `progressive popular text'.},

Abstract = {This article sets out to examine what fascism actually meant to its
   earliest British adherents focusing on Britain's first self-proclaimed
   fascist group, the British Fascisti (BF). Drawing on material from the
   BF's newspapers, the popular press, and archival sources, it argues that
   its members conceived of British fascism as an imperial solution to a
   crisis imagined in imperial terms. They envisioned British fascism in
   practice as the metropolitan extension of repressive imperial
   violence-that is, the ability to take whatever steps deemed necessary to
   safeguard the law, order, and the status quo, whether on the streets of
   Britain or those of the Punjab. In this sense, the article maintains,
   the BF formed part of a broader British political tradition, one that
   saw the `ethos' of Empire as a means of averting Britain's decline. It
   begins by introducing the BF and their ideology, moving to a discussion
   of how the Jewish-Bolshevik plot against the British Empire imagined by
   BF members reflected the colonial experiences of their leading
   personnel. It then interrogates the BF's proposed antidote to this
   anti-imperial conspiracy. By emulating the qualities and behaviour of
   Britain's imperial heroes and living an `imperial' way of life, they
   hoped to restore Britain to greatness. It concludes with a call for
   further research into the overlapping histories of British fascism and
   the British Empire.},

Abstract = {There is an established body of politically informed scholarly work that
   offers a sustained critique of how corporate business ethics is a form
   of organizing that acts as a subterfuge to facilitate the expansion of
   corporate sovereignty. This paper contributes to that work by using its
   critique as the basis for theorizing an alternative form of ethics for
   corporations. Using the case of the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal as
   an illustrative example, the paper theorizes an ethics that locates
   corporations in the democratic sphere so as to defy their professed
   ability to organize ethics in a self-sufficient and autonomous manner.
   The Volkswagen scandal shows how established organizational practices of
   corporate business ethics are no barrier to, and can even serve to
   enable, the rampant pursuit of business self-interest through
   well-orchestrated and large-scale conspiracies involving lying,
   cheating, fraud and lawlessness. The case also shows how society,
   represented by individuals and institutions, is able to effectively
   resist such corporate malfeasance. The democratic business ethics' that
   this epitomizes is one where civil society holds corporations to account
   for their actions, and in so doing disrupts corporate sovereignty. This
   ethics finds practical purchase in forms of dissent that redirect power
   away from centres of organized wealth and capital, returning it to its
   democratically rightful place with the people, with society.},

Abstract = {Musolff's study applies methods of cognitive metaphor analysis to
   Hitler's antisemitic imagery in Mein Kampf, especially to the
   conceptualization of the German nation as a (human) body that had to be
   cured from a deadly disease caused by Jewish parasites. The relevant
   expressions from the conceptual domains of biological and medical
   categories form a partly narrative, partly inferential-argumentative
   source `scenario', which centred on a notion of blood poisoning that was
   understood in three ways: a) as a supposedly real act of blood
   defilement, i.e. rape; b) as a part of the source scenario of
   illness-cure; and c) as an allegorical element of an apocalyptic
   narrative of a devilish conspiracy against the `grand design of the
   creator'. The conceptual differences of source and target levels were
   thus short-circuited to form a belief-system that was no longer open to
   criticism. The results cast new light on central topics of Holocaust
   research, such as the debates between more `intentionalist' and more
   `functionalist' explanations of the origins of the Holocaust, and the
   question of how the Nazi metaphor system helped gradually to `initiate'
   wider parts of the German populace into the implications of the
   illness-cure scenario as a blueprint for genocide. The Nazi antisemitic
   metaphor system thus provides a unique example of the cognitive forces
   that can be unleashed in the service of racist stigmatization and
   dehumanization.},

Abstract = {In 1997, Wu {[}T.C. Wu, Conference key distribution system with user
   anonymity based on algebraic approach, IEE Proc. Comput. Digit. Tech.
   144(2) (1997) 145-148] proposed a conference key distribution system
   (CKDS) with user anonymity using algebraic operations. User anonymity
   is, in which the identities of participants in a conference are
   anonymous to each other, except for the chairperson. In this article,
   two CKDSs with user anonymity are proposed. One is a modified one of the
   Wu's scheme that uses simple interpolating properties of polynomials to
   replace the algebraic approach. Both the Wu's original scheme and our
   modified one require a one-way hash function to hide the identities of
   participants and to protect each participant's common key shared with
   the chairperson. Both schemes also use the one-way hash function to
   provide the authentication for the chairperson. Moreover, we propose
   another scheme which does not use a one-way hash function, but also
   achieve the same purposes. Compared to the Wu's scheme, both our schemes
   require less computing time. The security of the proposed CKDSs is based
   on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm problem as well as
   the one-way hash cryptographic function assumption. Both schemes are
   secure against impersonation and conspiracy attacks. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {The Annex to the Malabo Protocol contains several provisions regulating
   in detail the modes of liability, some of which may be inspirational for
   future developments of international criminal law: among these, the
   exclusion of the defence of superior orders for all crimes included in
   the Annex to the Malabo Protocol, and the inclusion of corporate
   criminal liability for the crimes under the jurisdiction of the African
   Court of Justice and Human and Peoples' Rights. Such an innovation,
   surely a bold one, is in line with the development of international
   criminal law. The real challenge will be for the ( future) judges of the
   African Court of Justice and Human and Peoples' Rights, who will have to
   interpret the complex and not always coherent provisions of the
   Protocol. Unfortunately, it can be already anticipated that some
   provisions, such as the reintroduction of immunity for the African heads
   of state, will greatly undermine the credibility and efficacy of the
   Court if not amended.},

Title = {How to Motivate SARS-CoV-2 Convalescents to Receive a Booster
   Vaccination? Influence on Vaccination Willingness},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {(1) Background: Booster vaccinations for SARS-CoV-2 convalescents are
   essential for achieving herd immunity. For the first time, this study
   examined the influencing factors of vaccination willingness among
   SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and identified vaccination-hesitant
   subgroups. (2) Methods: Individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results
   were recruited by telephone. They completed an online questionnaire
   during their home isolation in Germany. This questionnaire assessed the
   vaccination willingness and its influencing factors. (3) Results: 224
   home-isolated individuals with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection were included
   in the study. Vaccination willingness of home-isolated SARS-CoV-2
   infected individuals with asymptomatic or moderate course was 54\%. The
   following factors were associated with significantly lower vaccination
   willingness: younger age, foreign nationality, low income, low trust in
   vaccination effectiveness, fear of negative vaccination effects, low
   trust in the governmental pandemic management, low subjective
   informativeness about SARS-CoV-2, support of conspiracy theories. (4)
   Conclusions: The vaccination willingness of homeisolated SARS-CoV-2
   infected individuals with asymptomatic or moderate symptomatic course
   was low. Motivational vaccination campaigns should be adapted to
   individuals with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and consider the
   vaccination-hesitant groups. Vaccination education should be
   demand-driven, low-threshold, begin during the acute infection phase,
   and be guided for example by the established 5C model ({''}confidence,
   complacency, constraints, calculation, collective responsibility{''}).},

Abstract = {The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as a
   significant and global public health crisis. Besides the rising number
   of cases and fatalities, the outbreak has also affected economies,
   employment and policies alike. As billions are being isolated at their
   homes to contain the infection, the uncertainty gives rise to mass
   hysteria and panic. Amidst this, there has been a hidden epidemic of
   ``information{''} that makes COVID-19 stand out as a ``digital
   infodemic{''} from the earlier outbreaks. Repeated and detailed content
   about the virus, geographical statistics, and multiple sources of
   information can all lead to chronic stress and confusion at times of
   crisis. Added to this is the plethora of misinformation, rumor and
   conspiracy theories circulating every day. With increased
   digitalization, media penetration has increased with a more significant
   number of people aiding in the ``information pollution.{''} In this
   article, we glance at the unique evolution of COVID-19 as an
   ``infodemic{''} in the hands of social media and the impact it had on
   its spread and public reaction. We then look at the ways forward in
   which the role of social media (as well as other digital platforms) can
   be integrated into social and public health, for a better symbiosis,
   ``digital balance{''} and pandemic preparedness for the ongoing crisis
   and the future.},

Abstract = {Objective: this article is an invitation to reflect on the stratagems
   that seek to limit or annul the actions of the Special Justice for Peace
   (JEP). Also, about the harmful consequences of these practices not only
   for society, but even for those who promote them.
   Methodology: in order to reflect on these positions, it is important to
   consider the different models of transitional justice.
   Results: in an internal conflict like the Colombian one, which flooded a
   whole country with violence for more than 50 years, many actors
   intervene. Among these, some have been fully recognized, while others
   remain anonymous. On the one hand, within the first group, there are
   many ex-militants (both from the State Military Forces as well as from
   the insurgency and from paramilitary groups) interested in resolving
   their legal situation through the Special Justice Tribunal for Peace
   (JEP). On the other hand, those who have not been prosecuted, condemned
   or even publicly exposed as responsible for acts of violence in the
   context of the conflict, deploy a whole series of strategies in order to
   prevent the transition process from being effective.
   Conclusions: political blindness, in a perverse conspiracy with
   ignorance about the explanatory principles and models that guide
   transitional justice, clouds any rationality that allows the effective
   transition from a society with an internal conflict to one with a stable
   and lasting peace.},

Title = {The curious incident of multi-instantons and the necessity of Lefschetz
   thimbles},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {We show that compatibility of supersymmetry with exact semi-classics
   demands that in calculating multi-instanton amplitudes, the
   ``separation{''} quasi-zeromode must be complexified and the integration
   cycles must be found by using complex gradient flow (or Picard-Lefschetz
   equations.) As a non-trivial application, we study N - 2 extended
   supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Even though in this case supersymmetry
   is unbroken, the instanton-anti-instanton amplitude (naively calculated)
   seems to contribute to the ground state energy. We show, however, that
   the instanton-anti-instanton event consists of two parts: a
   fermion-correlated and a scalar-correlated event. Although both of these
   contributions are naively of the same sign and the latter is
   superficially higher order in the perturbative coupling, we show that
   the two contributions exactly cancel when they are evaluated on
   Lefschetz thimbles due to their relative Hidden Topological Angles
   (HTAs). This gives strong evidence that the semi-classical expansion
   using Lefschetz thimbles is not only a meaningful prescription for
   higher order semi-classics, but a necessary one. This deduction seems to
   be universal and applicable to both supersymmetric and
   non-supersymmetric theories. In conclusion we speculate that similar
   conspiracies are responsible for the non-formation of certain molecular
   contributions in theories where instantons have more than two fermionic
   zeromodes and do not contribute to the superpotential.},

Title = {Public Moralities, Citizen Voices, and Disparate Fears},
Journal = {PUBLIC INTEGRITY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 27},
Abstract = {This article examines the contours of ``the public's morality(ies){''},
   either as an aggregate of individuals' public hopes and fears or (in the
   plural) as particular mixes of hopes and fears stemming from individual
   (or coalitional) moral convictions. Our theoretical understanding of one
   aggregate ``public morality{''} relies upon Derek Edyvane's presentation
   of a civic virtue premised upon an austerity whereby citizens value a
   collective sense of protection as highly as the realization of their
   individual public aspirations. We scrutinize Edyvane's theoretical
   construct in reference to a collection of citizen letters responding to
   Gerald Ford's 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon made available by the Gerald
   R. Ford Presidential Library. These letters illustrate a conceptual
   typology of public morality that reflects various combinations of the
   public hopes and fears Edyvane delineates; this typology accommodates
   most of the available letters. Psychological studies pertaining to
   prosocial behavior, individual moral convictions, and conspiracy beliefs
   are reviewed to understand sectarian fears that animate current
   political discourse. In this regard, we offer examples of political
   utterances appearing to fall outside Edyvane's treatment of public
   fears. A final discussion considers how citizen fears arising from
   disparate moral convictions affect administrative decision-making. It
   also directs attention to behavioral public administration that offers a
   micro-level perspective on individual behavior that impacts governance.},

   about contagion, health behaviors, and the actions of governing bodies
   impacted the spread of the virus and health and life. Researchers used
   an immediate, mixed methods design to explore sociocultural responses to
   the virus and identified differences and similarities in anxiety, fear,
   blame, and perceptions of nation across political divides.
   Methods Researchers conducted 60 in-depth, semi-structured interviews
   and administered over 1,000 questionnaires with people living in the
   United States. The team analyzed data through an exploratory and
   confirmatory sequential mixed methods design.
   Results In the first months of the pandemic interviewees cited economic
   inequality, untrustworthy corporations and other entities, and the
   federal government as threats to life and pandemic control. Participants
   invoked ideas about others to determine blame. Findings reveal heavy
   associations between lack of safety during a public health crisis and
   blame of ``culture{''} and government power across the political
   spectrum.
   Conclusion Data indicate anxiety across political differences related to
   ideas of contagion and the maleficence of a powerful elite. Findings on
   how people understand the nation, politics, and pandemic management
   contribute to understanding dimensions of health behaviors and
   underlying connections between anxiety and the uptake of conspiracy
   theories in public health. The article ends with recommendations drawn
   from project findings for future pandemic response.},

Abstract = {The statistics, listed in the article, prove that the most frequent
   encroachment on the life and health of citizens in the field of
   production and circulation of medicines and medical products is the
   falsification of medicines that is in demand every day and advertised on
   television and radio; including painkillers, antibiotics, psychotropic
   substances.
   There are a number of factors contributing to the commission of offenses
   in the sphere of production (manufacturing), storage, sales
   (realizations), import of medicines.
   The sphere of public procurement of medicines remains the most corrupted
   area of public relations. Thus, the most widespread type of crime in the
   health sector is theft of budget funds by excessive prices on market
   prices, when organizing the purchase of medicines, products and medical
   equipment for health care institutions. The most widespread corruption
   schemes for public procurement of medicines in Ukraine are the so-called
   ``cartel conspiracies{''}, in other words, behind-the-scenes agreements
   between companies on the distribution of winning bidding and excess
   pricing of medicines in the State Register of wholesale and retail
   prices.
   All considered violations require the development of a clear regulatory
   mechanism at the legislative and regulatory levels of the processes of
   production, control and marketing of medicinal products; only such
   actions will contribute to counteracting fraud and illicit circulation
   of falsified medicines and will provide protection of life and health of
   citizens.},

Abstract = {The mass-velocity-size relation of late-type galaxies decouples into
   independent correlations between mass and velocity (the Tully-Fisher
   relation), and between mass and size. This behaviour is different to
   early-type galaxies which lie on a Fundamental Plane. We study the
   coupling of the Tully-Fisher and mass-size relations in observations
   {[}the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) sample],
   empirical galaxy formation models based on halo abundance matching, and
   rotation curve fits with a hydrodynamically motivated halo profile. We
   systematically investigate the correlation coefficient between the
   Tully-Fisher residuals Delta V-r and mass-size residuals Delta R as a
   function of the radius rat which the velocity is measured, and thus
   present the Delta V-r-Delta R relation across rotation curves. We find
   no significant correlation in the data at any r, aside from r << R-eff
   where baryonic mass dominates. We show that this implies an
   anticorrelation between galaxy size and halo concentration (or halo
   mass) at fixed baryonic mass, and provides evidence against the
   hypothesis that galaxy and halo specific angular momentum are
   proportional. Finally, we study the Delta V-r-Delta R relations produced
   by the baryons and dark matter separately by fitting halo profiles to
   the data. The balance between these components illustrates the
   `disc-halo conspiracy' required for no overall correlation.},

Abstract = {In today's media discourse, in the context of enormous flood of
   information, wave of hoaxes and conspiracy theories, once again an
   urgent call rises for objective and truthful information provided by the
   news media. In connection with the so-called objective informing, so
   valued by the news media, the author sees the primary problem in
   confusing how we see reality and what actually is real, identifying a
   fact and truth and also in a huge volume of information that is
   impossible to verify thoroughly. The author believes that the so-called
   objective news media information can never represent 100\% truth and
   that axiological and pragmatic approach should be used to deal with the
   news media-presented truth that may only represent the truth partially.
   According to author our knowledge is relative and depends on the
   reference system that man has. The primary role of news media is simply
   to inform, rather than inform objectively and truthfully. Objective and
   truthful information remains an ideal that is subordinate; the primary
   value is seen in ontological security of people. News media education is
   therefore still needed as it should give those who send or receive
   information means to understand limitation of language and encourage
   asceticism in the sense of abstaining from premature assessment of the
   news media information in order to filter and process it critically.},

Abstract = {Objective: In Japan, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rate has
   sharply fallen to nearly 0\% due to sensational media reports of adverse
   events. Online anti-HPV-vaccination activists often warn readers of the
   vaccine's dangers. Here, we aimed to examine frequently appearing
   contents on pro-and anti-HPV vaccination websites.
   Methods: We conducted online searches via two major search engines
   (Google Japan and Yahoo! Japan). Targeted websites were classified as
   ``pro,{''} ``anti,{''} or ``neutral{''} according to their claims, with
   the author (s) classified as ``health professionals,{''} ``mass
   media,{''} or ``laypersons.{''}We then conducted a text mining analysis.
   Results: Of the 270 sites analyzed, 16 contents were identified. The
   most frequently appearing contents on pro websites were vaccine side
   effects, preventable effect of vaccination, and cause of cervical
   cancer. The most frequently appearing contents on anti websites were
   vaccine side effects, vaccine toxicity, and girls who suffer from
   vaccine side effects. Main disseminators of each content according to
   the author's expertise were also revealed.
   Conclusion: Pro-HPV vaccination websites should supplement deficient
   contents and respond to frequent contents on anti-HPV websites.
   Practice implications: Effective tactics are needed to better
   communicate susceptibility to cervical cancer, frequency of side
   effects, and responses to vaccine toxicity and conspiracy theories. (C)

Abstract = {This paper highlights Muhammadiyah's religious and social engagement and
   praxis in dealing with the pandemic in Indonesia. As Indonesia's largest
   modernist Islamic organisation with approximately 30 million members,
   Muhammadiyah has been chal-lenged to prove its progressive understanding
   of Islam during the C OvID-19 pandemic. Since March 2020, the
   organisation has issued religious fatwas and policies to adjust their
   worship and social activities during the outbreak. However, conservative
   elements oppose these fatwas and policies by stating that Covid-19 is a
   global conspiracy to destroy Islam. Through its networks and resources,
   Muhammadiyah keeps issuing fatwas to boost public awareness of the
   virus's dangers and mortality and protect and save lives. Thus, the
   paper seeks to discover why and how the organisation adopts new
   practices in their rituals and new sites of worship and, at the same
   time, fights against religious ignorance and hoaxes around the Covid-19.
   It also seeks to determine how Muhammadiyah mobilises its networks and
   resources to deal with the outbreak and opposition. Finally, it examines
   the organisation's relationship with state and non -state actors,
   nationally and internationally, to face the impacts of such a contagious
   virus. Drawing upon Muhammadiyah's official fatwas, policies,
   statements, and socio-religious praxis, this paper finds that
   Muhammadiyah's social mission, caring, and engagement during the
   pandemic are based on its progressive and rational belief system.},

Abstract = {Motivation: Disclosure of bid-rigging is not a trivial process. The main
   difficulty lies in the secrecy of such an agreement. Also, the signals
   of collusion can be ambiguous. It, therefore, appears that only a tiny
   percentage of such collusive agreements are disclosed. Of the disclosed
   conspiracies, a significant proportion was identified due to information
   from contracting authorities. We have a catalogue of indicators for
   collusion, and statisti-cal methods are particularly effective. What is
   the role of statistical methods in revealing bid-rigging? What
   determines their use in practice? In order to answer these questions, a
   questionnaire study was carried out. The survey covered local government
   units - the dominating group of contracting authorities.Aim: The
   research aimed to identify the factors characterising local government
   units that foster statistical methods as a standard bid evaluation
   tool.Results: The survey results indicate that using a statistical
   method as standard practice in the process of bids evaluation is related
   to the level of staff's professional expertise, the size of the
   procurement team and the size of the local authority. Concerning the
   risk of collusive bidding, respondents recognise it but believe that it
   does not significantly im-pact the achievement of procurement policy
   objectives. Despite a sense of responsibility for combating bid-rigging,
   respondents are reluctant to use statistical methods on a daily basis.},

Title = {Vaccine anxieties, vaccine preparedness: Perspectives from Africa in a

Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {298},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Global debates about vaccines as a key element of pandemic response and
   future preparedness in the era of Covid-19 currently focus on questions
   of supply, with attention to global injustice in vaccine distribution
   and African countries as rightful beneficiaries of international
   de-regulation and financing initiatives such as COVAX. At the same time,
   vaccine demand and uptake are seen to be threatened by hesitancy, often
   attributed to an increasingly globalised anti-vaxx movement and its
   propagation of misinformation and conspiracy, now reaching African
   populations through a social media `infodemic'. Underplayed in these
   debates are the socio-political contexts through which vaccine
   technologies enter and are interpreted within African settings, and the
   crucial intersections between supply and demand. We explore these
   through a `vaccine anxieties' framework attending to both desires for
   and worries about vaccines, as shaped by bodily, societal and wider
   political understandings and experiences. This provides an analytical
   lens to organise and interpret ethnographic and narrative accounts in
   local and national settings in Uganda and Sierra Leone, and their
   (dis)connections with global debates and geopolitics. In considering the
   socially-embedded reasons why people want or do not want Covid-19
   vaccines, and how this intersects with the dynamics of vaccine supply,
   access and distribution in rapidly-unfolding epidemic situations, we
   bring new, expanded insights into debates about vaccine confidence and
   vaccine preparedness.},
