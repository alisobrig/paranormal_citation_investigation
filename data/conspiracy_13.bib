Title = {Attitudes and Perceptions of Health Protection Measures Against the

Abstract = {Background: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to May
   2020), 6,169 Polish and 939 Italian residents were surveyed with an
   online questionnaire investigating socio-demographic information and
   personality traits (first section) as well as attitudes, position, and
   efficacy perceptions on the impact of lockdown (second section) and
   various health protection measures enforced (third section).Methods: The
   ``health protection attitude score{''} (HPAS), an endpoint obtained by
   pooling up the answers to questions of the third section of the survey
   tool, was investigated by multiple linear regression models, reporting
   regression coefficients (RC) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\%
   CI).Results: Concerns for business and health due to COVID-19 were
   associated with a positive attitude toward risk reduction rules. By
   contrast, male sex, concerns about the reliability of information
   available online on COVID-19 and its prevention, along with the feeling
   of not being enough informed on the transmissibility/prevention of
   SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a negative attitude toward risk
   mitigation measures.Discussion: A recent literature review identified
   two social patterns with different features in relation to their
   attitude toward health protection rules against the spread of COVID-19.
   Factors positively associated with adherence to public health guidelines
   were perceived threat of COVID-19, trust in government, female sex, and
   increasing age. Factors associated with decreased compliance were
   instead underestimation of the COVID-19 risk, limited knowledge of the
   pandemic, belief in conspiracy theories, and political conservativism.
   Very few studies have tested interventions to change attitudes or
   behaviors.Conclusion: To improve attitude and compliance toward risk
   reduction norms, a key intervention is fostering education and knowledge
   on COVID-19 health risk and prevention among the general population.
   However, information on COVID-19 epidemiology might be user-generated
   and contaminated by social media, which contributed to creating an
   infodemic around the disease. To prevent the negative impact of social
   media and to increase adherence to health protection, stronger content
   control by providers of social platforms is recommended.},

Title = {The Attempts of the Legalization of the National Radical Camp (The Group
   of `Szaniec') and Introducing its Representatives to the Authorities of
   the Polish Republic in Exile, 1939-1941},
Journal = {PAMIEC I SPRAWIEDLIWOSC},

Abstract = {The article is a contribution to the history of the Polish Authorities
   in exile during WW IL It describes the attempts of ``legalization{''} of
   the National Radical Camp the `ABC{''} group (0b6z Narodowo-Radykalny
   `ABC{''} ONR `ABC{''}) and the unsuccessful endeavors of introducing its
   representation into Polish quasi parliament in exile: National Council
   (Rada Narodowa) during the years: 1939-1941.
   Since the autumn 1939 the political circle of the Radical National Camp
   the `ABC{''} group, during WW II generally called the ``Szaniec{''}
   ({''}Rampart{''}) group, headed by secret and hierarchic Polish
   Organization (Organizacja Polska), has built its own conspiracy:
   military organization Salamander Union (Zwiqzek Jaszczurczy) and
   underground administration Civilian Commissioners (Komisariat Cywilny).
   From 1939 to 1940 the ``Szaniec{''} group sent two official emissaries,
   who were to represent this political circle at Polish Government in
   exile headed by general Sikorski. Tadesz Gluzifiski was the first
   emissary who left occupied Poland at the end of December 1939. He died
   in Hungary having his legs frostbitten after trespassing Tatra Mountains
   and Slovakia.
   The next, Mieczyslaw Harusewicz reached Paris at Easter 1940.
   Harusewicz's attempts to join the National Council as an official
   representative of ONR `ABC{''}, despite the initial declarations of the
   prime minister Sikorski, failed.
   After the military collapse of France, Harusewicz passed to Great
   Britain, where he established Committee of the National Radical Camp
   (ONR). Unfortunately, he was not successful in the efforts undertaken to
   introduce his organization to the system of Polish political parties
   which based the Polish authorities in exile. The members of ONR did not
   managed to gain the political importance among the parties consisting
   the government of gen. Sikorski (except Stronnictwo Narodowe National
   Party) nor introduce its representative to The National Council. It was
   mainly caused by the prewar ``black legend{''} of ONR, and the
   accusations of anti-Semitism, anti-democratism, fascism and last but not
   least, the consideration of the Polish authorities for the English
   public opinion.},

Title = {The 1999 Irish nurses' strike: nursing versions of the strike and
   self-identity in a general hospital},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of this paper is to report findings from a study
   investigating nurses' experiences of strike in one public general
   hospital in the Republic of Ireland.
   Background. October 1999 heralded the first nationwide nurses strike in
   the Republic of Ireland. The strike reflected an international shift
   towards industrial action in a profession which had previously viewed
   such action as the antithesis of professional behaviour.
   Methods. A focused ethnographic approach studied a group of striking
   Registered Nurses, not as a culture per se, but as a collection of
   individuals sharing a common human experience. A purposive sampling
   approach identified eight information-rich cases from a modified quota
   structure. Semi-structured interviews were carried out immediately prior
   to, during and at the end of the 1999 strike. The participants also
   maintained journals which were explored during the interviews. Data were
   analysed using a constant comparative approach, seeking to achieve
   category saturation.
   Findings. Four strike versions were identified. The anticipatory version
   is constructed as an inevitable protest, the orientation version as
   history-making solidarity and the performing version as a job of work.
   The withdrawal version is constructed as a conspiracy from which nurses
   are excluded. These versions portray ongoing tension that is experienced
   between conflicting self-identities of Registered Nurses as nurses and
   as strikers. The analysis revealed strategies adopted to resolve
   tensions between these identities within the dimensions of carer,
   patient advocate, multi-disciplinary team member and professional.
   Conclusions. Debate on such potentially contentious issues by individual
   nurses, hospital managers and union leaders may facilitate awareness and
   preparation in advance of any future industrial action. Strategies that
   may be helpful in the event of a strike include a prestrike orientation
   programme for the entire organization, a support system for staff during
   the strike and informal de-briefing among all staff in the context of a
   social gathering when the strike is over.},

Abstract = {There is little reason to doubt that groups like Advance New Zealand,

   dissemination-than any other group. Nonetheless, questions remain about
   the role of foreign linked entities like Himalaya New Zealand on the
   fringe of New Zealand politics. Parliament grounds have been cleared and
   the grass will regrow, but the disinformation networks behind the
   protests remain. The role for media in the coming months, and likely
   years, will be to not ignore these disinformation networks (and not
   unwittingly provide content for them) but to investigate them and
   analyse the role they are playing in the contemporary `post-truth'
   world.},

Title = {The use of the Dark Web as a COVID-19 information source: A
   three-country study},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Dark Web (i.e., the anonymous web or Darknet) contains potentially
   harmful COVID-19-related information and content such as conspiracy
   theories and forged certificates. The Dark Web may particularly attract
   in-dividuals who are suspicious about the pandemic, but there is no
   research concerning the use of the Dark Web as a COVID-19 information
   source. In this study, we investigated the role of COVID-19 skepticism,
   online activities, and loneliness in the use of the Dark Web platforms
   as a COVID-19 information source. The data (N = 3000) were gathered in
   April 2021 from 18 to 75-year-old respondents from Finland (n = 1000),
   Sweden (n = 1000) and the United Kingdom (n = 1000). The respondents
   were asked how often they had utilized Dark Web platforms (for example
   via TOR-network) as a COVID-19 information source during the pandemic.
   Self-reported measures of institutional trust, anti-vaccine stances,
   restriction obedience, online ac-tivities, and loneliness were used as
   predictors in the logistic regression model. Age, gender, and education
   were also included in the model. The Dark Web use was more prevalent in
   the UK and Sweden. There was an association between anti-vaccine stances
   and active Dark Web use in the UK and Sweden, while low institutional
   trust predicted use among Finnish respondents. In all countries,
   restriction disobedience was related to Dark Web use as a COVID-19
   information source. Frequent online gambling, increased social media
   use, and loneliness predicted Dark Web use, and these associations were
   even stronger among frequent Dark Web users than occasional users.
   Younger age and male gender were also associated with Dark Web use. The
   unregulated nature of the Dark Web makes it a risky alternative to
   COVID-19 information, attracting individuals who are suspicious about
   the pandemic and overall active online users. Misleading information and
   availability of forged certificates on the Dark Web challenge official
   health policies, posing significant risks for both individual and public
   health.},

Title = {Psychological predictors of vaccination intentions among US
   undergraduates and online panel workers during the 2020 COVID-19
   pandemic},

Abstract = {Objective Availability of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19
   is critical for controlling the pandemic, but herd immunity can only be
   achieved with high vaccination coverage. The present research examined
   psychological factors associated with intentions to receive COVID-19
   vaccination and whether reluctance towards novel pandemic vaccines are
   similar to vaccine hesitancy captured by a hypothetical measure used in
   previous research.
   Method Study 1 was administered to undergraduate students when COVID-19
   was spreading exponentially (February-April 2020). Study 2 was conducted
   with online panel workers toward the end of the first U.S. wave (July
   2020) as a pre-registered replication and extension of Study 1. In both
   studies, participants (total N = 1,022) rated their willingness to
   receive the COVID-19 vaccination and to vaccinate a hypothetical child
   for a fictitious disease, and then responded to various psychological
   measures.
   Results In both studies, vaccination intentions were positively
   associated with past flu vaccine uptake, self-reported vaccine
   knowledge, vaccine confidence, and sense of collective responsibility.
   Complacency (not perceiving disease as high-risk), anti-vaccine
   conspiracy beliefs, perceived vaccine danger, and mistrust in
   science/scientists were negative correlates of vaccination intentions.
   Constraints (psychological barriers), calculation (extensive
   information-searching), analytical thinking, perceived disease
   vulnerability, self-other overlap, and conservatism were weakly
   associated with vaccination intentions but not consistently across both
   studies or vaccine types. Additionally, similar factors were associated
   with both real and hypothetical vaccination intentions, suggesting that
   conclusions from pre-COVID vaccine hesitancy research mostly generalize
   to the current pandemic situation.
   Conclusion Encouraging flu vaccine uptake, enhancing confidence in a
   novel vaccine, and fostering a sense of collective responsibility are
   particularly important as they uniquely predict COVID-19 vaccination
   intentions. By including both actual pandemic-related hesitancy measures
   and hypothetical hesitancy measures from past research in the same
   study, this work provides key context for the generalizability of
   earlier non-pandemic research.},

Title = {Cancer patients and internal medicine patients attitude towards COVID-19
   vaccination in Poland},

Abstract = {Background. The initial approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna
   vaccines by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) marked a milestone in the fight against the
   COVID-19 pandemic. The increased public debate about the vaccine
   development process and vaccine side effects has activated the
   anti-vaccine community, which has begun to spread conspiracy theories
   about vaccine safety.
   Objectives. Our study is the first to investigate the awareness of
   Polish patients suffering from various chronic diseases, mainly cancer,
   about vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.
   Materials and methods. An anonymous survey was made available from
   November 2020 to February 2021 to representatives of patient
   organizations through social media (Facebook) and to patients in the
   Chemotherapy Department of the Clinical Hospital in Poznan. The survey
   was completed by 836 patients. The majority of the survey respondents
   had cancer (77\%, n = 644), and almost 1/5 of the respondents indicated
   hypertension (15.7\%, n = 131) as well as depression and/or anxiety
   disorders (11.1\%, n = 93).
   Results. Less than half of the respondents (43.5\%, n = 364) believed
   that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were safe (40.4\%, n = 260, among cancer
   patients; 53.9\%, n = 104, among patients with other medical
   conditions). More than half of the respondents (60.5\%, n = 506)
   intended to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (58.8\%, n = 378, among
   cancer patients; 66.3\%, n = 128, among patients with other medical
   conditions). Fear of vaccine complications and lack of belief in vaccine
   effectiveness were prevalent among both cancer patients and patients
   with other medical conditions.
   Conclusions. The vast majority of cancer and medical patients wanted to
   be vaccinated against COVID-19. More than half of the respondents did
   not believe that the COVID-19 vaccine would be safe for them. Education
   of cancer and medical patients on the safety and effectiveness of the
   vaccine, as well as the use of additional protective measures against
   infection, is an extremely important element of prevention during the
   COVID-19 pandemic.},

Title = {The Relationship Between Delusions and Violence <i>Findings From the
   East London First Episode Psychosis Study</i>},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Importance: Psychotic persons who are violent often explain their
   violence as being due to delusions. However, research has failed to
   confirm associations between delusions and violent behavior.
   Objectives: To investigate which delusional beliefs and characteristics
   are associated with violent behavior during a first episode of psychosis
   and whether these associations are mediated by affect due to delusions.
   Design: Population-based epidemiological survey of first-episode
   psychosis during a 2-year study period.
   Setting: Three inner-city boroughs in East London, England.
   Participants: A total of 458 patients with first-episode psychosis who
   were 18 to 64 years of age.
   Interventions: Patients were clinically assessed (using the Schedules
   for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and the Maudsley Assessment
   of Delusions Schedule) and interviewed about their displaying violent
   behavior while experiencing psychotic symptoms during the 12-month
   period prior to interview.
   Main Outcome Measures: Violence was classified at 2 levels of severity:
   minor and serious violence.
   Results: The prevalence of violence was 38\% during the 12-month period,
   and 12\% of the sample engaged in serious violence. Distinct sets of
   demographic and comorbid risk factors were associated with minor and
   serious violence. These were adjusted for in subsequent analyses. Anger
   was the only affect due to delusions that was positively associated with
   violence. The population-attributable risk percentage was 30.8\% for
   minor violence and 55.9\% for serious violence. A small number of
   uncommon delusional beliefs demonstrated direct pathways leading to
   minor violence. Three highly prevalent delusions demonstrated pathways
   to serious violence mediated by anger due to delusional beliefs:
   persecution (z=3.09, P=.002), being spied on (z=3.03, P=.002), and
   conspiracy (z=2.98, P=.002).
   Conclusions and Relevance: Anger due to delusions is a key factor that
   explains the relationship between violence and acute psychosis. A subset
   of delusional beliefs may be causally linked to violence, and certain
   uncommon beliefs demonstrated a direct association with minor violence.
   Highly prevalent delusional beliefs implying threat were associated with
   serious violence, but they were mediated by anger.},

Abstract = {Public corruption through trafficking in influence, conflict of
   interest, arbitrary deflection of public funds, prevarication, fraud,
   extortion, fraudulent claims, erroneous or made-up financial statements,
   conspiracy, concussion, bribery, among other infractions reported lately
   are human behaviors harmful to all and affect our society; because it
   puts in doubt the integrity of public management. The research
   considered two perspectives: the first integrated by society with an
   observer and critical population, who analyzes and judges the actions of
   process managers; there is also a population focused on lack of
   protection if it expresses its opinion and denounces acts of corruption
   to avoid problems and possible retaliation in their social, work or
   personal environment. The second perspective was developed around public
   servants who exercise internal or external control activities and should
   address a general context; not only from compliance with provisions
   imposed by higher bodies, but from its essence as a human being and
   under a legal, social, ethical and professional basis, reflecting the
   spontaneous fulfillment of obligations and respect for the
   constitutional rights acquired by those administered for an effective
   and efficient public management. Through a technical and professional
   work proposed in the Comprehensive Forensic Audit, it would be possible
   to eradicate corruption at the root, as evidenced in a sustained and
   motivated way probable crimes by action or omission provoked by servers
   that fail to observe and breach the legality and due process in its
   management; with the consequent administrative, civil or criminal
   responsibilities. The applied methodology was qualitative, through the
   analysis of the question and direct participation. The technique
   implemented was the bibliographical and documentary. In conclusion, it
   is proposed as a technical mechanism to solve the problem of corruption
   the integral forensic audit, which allows the internal or external
   auditor; to define its position with ethics, against this social damage
   in a context of internal corrective preventive control, contributing
   through the technical process of integral audit evidence sufficient,
   competent, pertinent, that supports and motivates to the administrative
   resolutions and judicial sentences which impose sanctions in accordance
   with current regulations.},

Title = {COVID-19 vaccines uptake: Public knowledge, awareness, perception and
   acceptance among adult Africans},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Abstract = {Introduction
   The willingness of Africa's population to patronise the COVID-19
   vaccines is critical to the efficiency of national immunisation
   programmes. This study surveys the views of adult African inhabitants
   toward vaccination and the possibility of participating or not
   participating in governments' efforts to get citizens vaccinated.
   Method
   A cross-sectional online survey of adult Africans was undertaken from
   December 2020 to March 2021. Responses were anonymised. The Pearson
   Chi-square test was performed to determine whether or not there were any
   variations in knowledge, awareness, perception and acceptance of the
   COVID-19 vaccines among the participants. Binomial logistic regression
   was used to evaluate the factors associated with willingness to accept
   the COVID-19 vaccines and participate in immunisation programmes.
   Results
   The results indicate that COVID-19 vaccines are more likely to be used
   by adult Africans over the age of 18 who are largely technologically
   savvy (55 percent) if the vaccine is made broadly available. A total of
   33 percent of those who responded said they were unlikely to receive the
   vaccine, with another 15 percent stating they were undecided. Aside from
   that, we found that vaccine hesitancy was closely associated with
   socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education and
   source of information. We also found that there were widespread
   conspiracies and myths about the COVID-19 vaccines.
   Conclusion
   More than one-third of African adults who participated in the survey
   indicated they would not receive the COVID-19 vaccine, with majority of
   them expressing skepticisms about the vaccine's efficacy. It is possible
   that many of the people who would not be vaccinated would have an impact
   on the implementation of a COVID-19 immunisation programme that is meant
   for all of society. Majority of the respondents were unwilling to pay
   for the COVID-19 vaccines when made available. An awareness campaign
   should be focused on promoting the benefits of vaccination at the
   individual and population levels, as well as on taking preemptive
   actions to debunk misconceptions about the vaccines before they become
   further widespread.},

Abstract = {We present the results of an investigation of the local escape velocity
   (V-esc) - line strength index relationship for 48 early-type galaxies
   from the SAURON sample, the first such study based on a large sample of
   galaxies with both detailed integral field observations and extensive
   dynamical modelling. Values of V-esc are computed using multi-Gaussian
   expansion (MGE) photometric fitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic Jeans'
   dynamical modelling simultaneously on Hubble Space Telescope and
   ground-based images. We determine line strengths and escape velocities
   at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation of the
   correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. We
   find a tight correlation between V-esc and the line-strength indices.
   For Mgb, we find that this correlation exists not only between different
   galaxies but also inside individual galaxies - it is both a local and
   global correlation. The Mgb-V-esc relation has the form: log(Mgb/4 A) =
   (0.32 +/- 0.03) log(V-esc/500 km s-1) - (0.031 +/- 0.007) with an rms
   scatter Sigma = 0.033. The relation within individual galaxies has the
   same slope and offset as the global relation to a good level of
   agreement, though there is significant intrinsic scatter in the local
   gradients. We transform our line strength index measurements to the
   single stellar population (SSP) equivalent ages (t), metallicity
   ({[}Z/H]) and enhancement ({[}alpha/Fe]) and carry out a principal
   component analysis of our SSP and V-esc data. We find that in this
   four-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a
   good approximation confined to a plane, given by log (V (esc)/500 km s
   -1) = 0.85 {[}Z/H] + 0.43 log (t/Gyr) - 0.29. It is surprising that a
   combination of age and metallicity is conserved; this may indicate a
   `conspiracy' between age and metallicity or a weakness in the SSP
   models. How the connection between stellar populations and the
   gravitational potential, both locally and globally, is preserved as
   galaxies assemble hierarchically may provide an important constraint on
   modelling.},

Title = {TERMINATION WITHOUT EXPLANATION CONTRACTS},
Journal = {UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1059-U305},
Abstract = {Firms routinely terminate their contractual relationship with consumers.
   For example, Twitter has recently removed more than 70,000 accounts that
   allegedly promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory. Similarly, during
   2019-2020, Facebook terminated 5.4 billion supposedly fake accounts. At
   the same time, WhatsApp announced that it is terminating 2 million user
   accounts per month for spreading fake news. As another example, Discord
   terminated 5.2 million user accounts for allegedly publishing spam and
   exploitative content.
   Terminating accounts that facilitate and promote fake profiles, fake
   news, spam, hatred, inappropriate content, or cheating makes sense. Past
   incidents and consumer complaints, however, indicate that firms often
   terminate their relationship with consumers without explanation. Such
   termination without explanation may be socially costly and undesirable.
   First, if firms fail to explain to consumers the cause for termination,
   a hasty, unfounded, and erroneous termination is more likely to occur.
   Second, erroneous contract termination, fueled by a lack of explanation,
   may generate significant costs to consumers. These may include the loss
   of sunk investments, emotional costs, and switching costs. Third,
   termination without explanation may rely on nontransparent
   discriminatory factors. Alas, such terminations may disproportionately
   target and harm vulnerable consumers while eroding imperative societal
   values.
   Given these risks and costs, this Article marks the first attempt to
   systematically and empirically study the phenomenon we dub ``termination
   without explanation contracts.{''} We use this term to refer to consumer
   contracts which allow firms to terminate their relationship with their
   consumers without disclosing the reason for termination. In doing so,
   this Article empirically examines the contractual termination mechanisms
   of 500 online contracts of the most popular websites in the United
   States. The results of our study show, among other things, that the vast
   majority of these contracts are nontransparent termination without
   explanation contracts. We therefore propose to consider imposing a duty
   to explain on firms. We also present a transparency index that captures
   key aggravating factors and can help tackle the issue from a holistic
   approach.},

Title = {MARIN DRZIC VIDRA IN TUSCANY IN THE AUTUMN OF 1565},
Journal = {ANALI ZAVODA ZA POVIJESNE ZNANOSTI HRVATSKE AKADEMIJE ZNANOSTI I
   UMJETNOSTI U DUBROVNIKU},

Abstract = {The article casts light on a recent discovery of the randomly mentioned
   name of Marin Drzic in the correspondence of (by then already former)
   Ragusan archbishop Lodovico Beccadelli written in December 1565. In a
   letter addressed on 15 December 1565 to his long-life friend, Ragusan
   nobleman Ivan Marinov Gondola, Beccadelli refers to Gondola's previous
   letter from which he had learnt about his spacious residence in Prato
   (where he acted as provost in the service of Cosimo I de' Medici)
   Gondola had already been reported by ``Sir Marino Vidra{''} (messer
   Marino Vidra). From Beccadelli's letter it becomes evident that Drzic
   was in Tuscany already in 1565, one year prior to his Florentine
   conspirational letters addressed to Cosimo I, in addition to the fact
   that he was personally acquainted with the former Ragusan archbishop. A
   somewhat narrower time-frame of Drzic's visit to Prato may be gleaned
   from the other segments of Beccadelli's correspondence written in 1565,
   which may lead to a conclusion that the meeting had probably taken place
   after Beccadelli's return from Calenzano in mid-July 1565, and most
   certainly before the end of October that year, because the (unknown)
   letter of Ivan Gondola to which the prelate refers in his reply was
   dated with the last day of that month. On the circumstances in which the
   Ragusan meeting between Drzic and Gondola had taken place one cannot
   speculate, yet the fact that Gondola was one of Drzic's long-time
   creditors had no negative impact on the relationship between the
   nobleman and writer. Through contextualisation of the mention of Marin
   Drzic in Beccadelli's letter to Gondola of 15 December 1565, the article
   examines its threefold implications: confirmation of personal contact,
   that is, the fact that Beccadelli and Drzic were acquainted, testimony
   of Drzic's stay in Tuscany in 1565, a year prior to the conspiracy
   attempt against Ragusan government, along with written proof of the use
   of Drzic's nickname Vidra (Otter) in his lifetime.},

Abstract = {According to more recent research, the sculpture from the staircase of
   Jan Klemens Branicki's palace in Bialystok, most often referred to as
   Rotator ({''}Rotating{''}) or Arrotino ({''}Knife Grinder{''}) may have
   depicted one of the Roman heroes (Vindictius, Milichus or Fenius Rufus)
   who, while doing his job, overheard the conspirators and thus thwarted
   their scheming. It was supposed to be an allusion to the role of Hetman
   Jan Klemens Branicki (the founder of the sculpture) in the contemporary
   events - the conflict over the Ostrog ski Ordination. This thesis is
   confirmed by handwritten satires, created in connection with the dispute
   over the ordination (Lysa rada kolbuszowska {[}The Bald Council of
   Kolbuszowa] and Scena tragiczno-komiczna na ... {[}A Tragicomical
   Scene]), of which Branicki is one of the main characters. In Scena
   tragiczno-komiczna na, the division of the ordination was presented as a
   conspiracy against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was
   discovered and pacified by Hetman Branicki and his army. He started
   these actions on his own during the king's absence, becoming the most
   important person in the country and the man of the moment, and then
   completed them in cooperation with the returning monarch. Thus, the
   Rotator from Bialystok can be referred to Branicki, the beloved Polish
   son, a loyal subject and a great military leader who prevented civil
   war. In the journalistic texts related to the dispute over the Ostrog
   ski Ordination, Branicki was also compared to his ancestor, Hetman
   Stefan Czarniecki, as similarly to him, he would prevent the
   Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the internal conflict. Stefan
   Czarniecki is a very popular character in Bialystok, often depicted in
   sculptures and paintings ordered by Branicki. In fact, Branicki did not
   have any serious merits as a hetman; it was only from the perspective of
   the dispute over the ordination and his portrayal as a great leader and
   the man of the moment that the cultivation of the memory of Stefan
   Czamiecki gained a special importance.},

Abstract = {This paper sets out to systematize the multiple pseudonyms used by the
   contemporary writer G. Chkhartishvili. These are B. Akunin (The
   Adventures of Erast Fandorin, The Adventures of Sister Pelagia, a series
   of novels The Adventures of the Master, the project Genres, the plays
   The Seagull, Yin and Yang, the project The History of the Russian
   State), Boris Akunin and Grigory Chkhartishvili (Cemetery Stories),
   Akunin-Chkhartishvili (Aristonomy, Another Way), Grigory Chkhartishvili
   (The Writer and Suicide), Anatoly Brusnikin (Devyatny Spas, Hero of
   Another Time, Bellona) and Anna Borisova (Kreativschik, There, The
   Seasons). We investigate reasons for the multiplicity of Akuninian
   pseudonyms, a strategically honed system of which contributes to his
   authorial image. It is shown that, while the commercial pseudonyms are
   aimed at promoting his new literary projects and are implemented through
   a conspiracy game played with the reader, the creative ones serve to
   manifest the author ` s breadth of interests and philological knowledge
   such that every new pen name triggers a new writing strategy and a new
   creative tactic. The analysis of various literary masks' influence on
   the author ` s creative outcome shows that each pseudonym is `placed' in
   the literary, genre or artistic time of the text. B. Akunin is primarily
   the author of historical retro-detective stories, whereas adventure
   novels are signed by the pen name of A. Brusnikin. A. Borisova `writes'
   prose set in the present day. From the very beginning, the author's real
   name has been always assigned to his serious literature. The authorial
   system of names is being constantly refined, distinguishing B. Akunin,
   the fiction writer, from G. Chkhartishvili, the elite literature writer,
   in the novels Aristonomy and Another Way the twinned name
   Akunin-Chartishvili deliver another conceptual image. In conclusion it
   is stated that the abundance of Chartishvili's pen names evinces the
   author's intellectual and personal intrigue, which points to
   multiconceptual character of their pseudonymous code, being auto-and
   self-marketing, creative auto- and self-identification.},

Title = {MOBILIZATION SCENARIOS OF DEVELOPMENT: ORIGINS AND CONSEQUENCES},
Journal = {TERRA ECONOMICUS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-88},
Abstract = {The authors, offering mobilization scenarios for the development of the
   Russian economy, follow the historical method and propose to nationalize
   the key industries, restore the Soviet planned economy system and adopt
   some aspects of the German economy of the 1930s. Critics of this
   approach, however, highlight the incompatibility between the planned
   economy system and the private interest which drives investment and
   generates development. These researchers regard mobilization scenarios
   as asmokescreen for political agendas and a means of militarizing the
   economy. The author of the paper assumes that mobilization thinking was
   formed in the totalitarian society, under social inequality and the
   state's aggressive impact on public opinion. Accordingly, three sources
   of mobilization thinking can be identified: nationalism, social
   hierarchy, and the social consciousness aberration. Economic nationalism
   (or protectionism) appears in mobilization scenarios in the form of
   strict foreign exchange regulations and other isolationist policies. The
   paper shows that the lack of ethical principles can lead the proponents
   of nationalism to conclusions which are unacceptable from the
   conventional morality point of view. The deep-rooted ideas of inequality
   and superiority served as the second driver of mobilization thinking
   which rejects democracy and suggests a hierarchical system of social
   relationships. The social consciousness aberration is a product of the
   totalitarian society, where propaganda creates disrespect for the truth
   which invades science. The aberration comes in the shape of conspiracy
   theories, economic dogmatism and mythologization of history.
   Mobilization scenarios involve financial system reforms based on the
   practices of the Soviet and German prewar economies. The essence of the
   approach is to expand the use of directive methods and restrict
   financial markets, so that money and interest rate would become
   technical accounting indicators. The scenarios suggest directive methods
   of encouraging investment: setting differential lending rates, emitting
   ``investment ruble{''}, etc. Referring to the macroeconomic model of the
   ``investment trap{''} and the history of voucher emission in Russia in
   the 1990s, the author demonstrates the method of creating `` special
   assets{''} to be invalid.},

Title = {A Letter from John III of Sweden to King Charles IX of France: A New
   Source for the History of the Baltic Wars},
Journal = {QUAESTIO ROSSICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {901-917},
Abstract = {The letter of King John III of Sweden to King Charles IX of France from
   October 13, 1568, covers several subjects of the history of Baltic wars
   in the second half of the sixteenth century. What is most noticeable
   among them is the reasons why John III's brother King Eric XIV was
   overthrown in September 1568, the plot against John of Finland to hand
   over Catherine Jagiellon, his wife and sister of Sigismund II Augustus,
   the Polish king, and grand duke of Lithuania, to the Russian czar Ivan
   the Terrible, as well as the period when the Northern Seven Years' War
   ended. After his accession to the throne, John III faced several
   problems, which he had to solve. Firstly, the second son of Gustav I of
   Sweden had to legitimise his ascension in the eyes of the European
   monarchs, then break the international isolation of the Swedish kingdom
   and protect himself from internal and external conspiracies. His main
   goal was to free the imprisoned Eric XIV. The solution to these problems
   depended directly on stabilising Sweden's foreign policy position,
   achievable through reconciliation with a hostile coalition of Denmark,
   Lubeck, and Poland and building an alliance with the French royal court,
   which offered mediation to end the hostilities. In the text of the
   published letter, the Swedish king appeals to the feelings of the French
   monarch, trying to show the ``baseness{''} and ``wickedness{''} of his
   elder brother's policy, but also assures him of sincere friendship,
   proving the long-standing allied nature of the Swedish-French relations.
   All this makes the letter of John III to Charles IX a valuable
   historical source, whose value is fully revealed in the context of
   Swedish-French, Russian-Swedish and Russian-French relations in the
   sixteenth century. Published for the first time, it comes from the
   collection of P. P. Dubrovsky (13, No. 9), Russian National Library (St
   Petersburg). The article publishes the text of the letter in Latin as
   well as a translation into Russian.},

Abstract = {The authorization of several high-efficacy vaccines for use against the
   novel SARS-CoV2 virus signals a transition in the global COVID-19
   response. Vaccine acceptance is critical for pandemic control and has a
   variety of context-specific drivers that operate at the individual,
   group, and sociopolitical levels. Social and behavior change
   interventions can influence individual knowledge, attitudes, and
   intentions as well as community norms to facilitate widespread vaccine
   uptake. While considerable research has been done to explore vaccine
   confidence in high-income populations as well as with respect to
   childhood vaccinations, much work remains to be done in understanding
   attitudes and intentions in low and middle income countries for adult or
   novel vaccines. We conducted in-depth interviews with individuals who
   had recovered from COVID-19 (n = 8), people who had lost a family member
   to COVID-19 (n = 4), and health providers (n = 17). We also conducted
   focus group discussions with members of the general population (n = 24
   groups) to explore social norms and community perceptions related to
   COVID-19, including prevention behaviors, stigma, and vaccines.
   Researchers collected data in Abidjan, Cate d'Ivoire, in November 2020.
   In considering whether to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine or not,
   individuals in the study weighed perceived risk of the vaccine against
   the severity of the disease. Perceived severity of rumored side effects
   or safety issues of vaccines were also a factor. Convenience was a
   secondary, albeit also important, consideration. While concerns about
   vaccine safety tended to produce an expressed intention to delay
   vaccination, conspiracy theories about those developing and promoting
   vaccines and their motives led people to say they would opt out
   entirely. Behavior change interventions must raise awareness and address
   misunderstandings about the purpose of vaccines, transparently
   communicate about vaccine safety and development processes, and engage
   trusted influencers to build an enabling environment for COVID-19
   vaccine roll out. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

Abstract = {The formation of modern Russia in the interaction of history and logic
   is the subject of this study. It covers a chronological framework from
   the socialist revolution of the 1917th to the present day. The initial
   principle of the authors is that the adequate analysis of the problem
   raised in the work is possible only from the standpoint of understanding
   social changes as a natural historical process. Consequently, the theory
   of fatal inevitability, as well as the conspiracy theory in explaining
   the arrival of the post-Soviet present of our country, is unjustified.
   In other words, the revolutionary turn in October 1917 could not help
   splitting society into hostile forces, the struggle between which never
   ceased. At the same time, the CPSU as a leading and guiding social
   changes force not only proved inability to work out the answers to the
   challenges of history but also itself degenerated. In the conditions of
   severe rivalry between the two worlds - socialism and capitalism - these
   factors multiplied many times. Post-Soviet realities have sobered the
   Russians: did they fight for it? Did not they throw out the child
   together with the delivery water (whatever was good in socialism)? In
   the public consciousness, a turn is made towards recognizing, if not
   all, at least some socialist values. At the same time, there is a
   growing awareness of the need to take into account the cultural
   peculiarities of Russia when moving ``along the high road of human
   civilization{''}, that is, on the way to affirm the values of the
   Western world. Based on the documents of the CPSU, the messages of the
   President of the Russian Federation to the Federal Assembly, the works
   of the classics of culture (and not only Russian), the language of
   everyday life the authors come to a fundamental conclusion, that is,
   there is a situation developing in the country that will be reflected in
   the public consciousness in the form of another project for the
   reorganization of Russia on perfect principles. And it will be the next
   one, i.e. not the last.},

Pages = {15-34},
Abstract = {In December 1922, London was enthralled by a sensational murder trial at
   the Old Bailey. The 28-year-old woman at the centre of the scandal,
   Edith Thompson, came to notoriety when her lover, 20-year-old Freddy
   Bywaters, a merchant seaman, murdered her husband, Percy Thompson, when
   the couple was returning home from the theatre late one evening. When 62
   of her letters were found on his ship, he confessed, but insisted that
   she had no part in the crime. In her letters, she claimed that she put
   `something into Percy's tea' and put `big pieces' of light bulb in his
   porridge, and there were ambiguous passages about `taking risks' and
   their future together. Thompson's letters were entered into the trial as
   evidence of incitement and conspiracy. Their melodramatic structure and
   rhetoric made it difficult to extract stable meaning. It was, however,
   precisely the melodramatic attributes and intimate details of her
   letters - with their expressions of psychic pain, longing, desire,
   frustration, boredom, and the material details of private lives - that
   made them irresistible to the public and the media. In the first part of
   this paper, I examine the discourses that were used to interpret the
   letters in the trial, and render their author culturally intelligible.
   In the second part, I analyse the affective mediation of the case -
   including the trial, the verdict, the executions, and the controversy
   about the death penalty - in the media, and the role of the media in
   producing public feelings. I argue that the concept of melodrama,
   understood not as a genre but as a mode which names heightened emotion,
   acted like a contagion, spreading affect from the letters to the
   courtroom and the media. What conclusions can we draw- about law and
   affect, evidence and intimacy, public archives and private lives - from
   this case that are relevant for feminist critical legal scholarship
   today?},

Title = {`Ted Cruz cucks again': the insult term cuck as an alt-right masculinist
   signifier},
Journal = {GENDER AND LANGUAGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {99-124},
Abstract = {This article provides a multimodal semiotic analysis of the word cuck as
   used in online white supremacist spaces. A fundamental belief of the
   white supremacist `alt-right' movement is an anti-Semitic narrative that
   positions Jewish people as a `global elite' that seeks to oppress and
   eliminate white populations. Central to this belief is that Jewish
   people actively manipulate populations of colour, Black people in
   particular, to overtake white populations in a process known as `white
   genocide' or `the great replacement'. Based on a digital ethnography of
   altright communities on Voat, Twitter and Reddit, this article
   demonstrates how the memeified word `cuck', a pejorative term for `weak'
   men on the US political rightwing, draws from and reproduces this white
   nationalist conspiracy theory through allusions to interracial cuckold
   pornography. While disguised as innocuous, expressions like `cuck'
   provide insight into how the alt-right weaponises misogynist and racist
   humour in its radicalisation efforts.
   Este artigo analisa, a partir de uma perspectiva semiotica multimodal,
   os usos da palavra cuck (corno) em espacos online para supremacistas
   brancos. Uma crenca central para os movimentos supremacistas brancos da
   nova direita se baseia em uma narrativa antissemitica que posiciona o
   povo judeu como uma `elite global' que quer oprimir e eliminar a
   populacao branca. No cerne desta crenca esta a ideia de que o povo judeu
   ativamente manipula pessoas racializadas, especialmente o povo preto,
   para substituir a populacao branca em um processo conhecido como
   `genocidio branco' ou `a grande substituicao'. Baseado em uma etnografia
   digital em comunidades da nova direita no Voat, Twitter e Reddit, este
   artigo mostra como a construcao de memes com a palavra `cuck' (corno),
   um termo pejorativo que se refere a homens `fracos' da direita
   americana, se baseia e reproduz esta teoria conspiratoria do
   nacionalismo branco atraves de alusoes a pornografia interracial de
   traicao. Embora parecam inofensivas, expressoes como `cuck' ilustram
   como a nova direita transforma a misoginia e humor racista em armas para
   seus esforcos de radicalizacao.},

Title = {Deception detection on social media: A source-based perspective},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {256},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {Fast, open, free, and accessible, online social networks are massively
   used to share news and various information. Unfortunately, their
   explosive growth amplifies the dissemination of misinformation, posing a
   severe threat to our societies. Nowadays, it is also a home ground for
   wrongdoers to spread fake news, rumors, conspiracies, hoaxes, and other
   forms of deception. Therefore, there is an urgent need to deploy
   efficient algorithms to tackle this infodemic. Current research focuses
   mainly on the news content or context to tell the difference between
   what is credible and what is not. Content-based methods concentrate on
   detecting the false knowledge the message carries in its writing style.
   Context-based methods rely on their propagation patterns or the
   credibility of their source. Finally, some hybrid methods combine these
   various types. This paper proposes a source-based method in a machine
   learning framework. It focuses on the profile and the interactions of
   the news spreaders. Thus, On Twitter, we associate each news article
   with the interaction network formed by the authors of tweets and their
   first-degree ego network. Experiments are conducted on two real-world
   datasets publicly available, covering different domains (Politifact,
   GossipCop). We select the most diversified news to assess the
   performance of various machine learning approaches. We conduct an
   extensive investigation to choose the best network and user-profile
   features and the most effective machine learning model that can classify
   news with the highest accuracy. The most effective set of features is
   well-balanced. It includes four network features and four user-profile
   parameters. Results show that the ``XG Boost{''} model outperforms its
   alternatives. (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Multi-Layer Perceptron,
   K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine). It achieves 92\% and 91\%
   accuracy on the Politifact and GossipCop datasets. Comparisons with
   baselines covering a large spectrum of solutions demonstrate its
   superiority. The proposed solution is promising. Indeed, it requires
   limited information with few news articles for training. Furthermore, it
   can detect deception in its initial stage. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {COVID-19 Vaccine Intentions and Perceptions Among Public School Staff of
   the Greater Vancouver Metropolitan Area, British Columbia, Canada},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to explore factors associated
   with COVID-19 vaccine intentions among school staff as high vaccine
   uptake is essential to ensure schools return to normal activities.
   MethodsStaff (e.g., teachers, administrators, student support workers)
   from three urban school districts in the Greater Vancouver Area of
   British Columbia, Canada completed a survey between February and June
   2021 (n = 2,393) on COVID-19 vaccine intentions and perceptions (i.e.,
   acceptance of routine vaccines, benefits and risks of vaccination,
   susceptibility to, and severity of COVID-19, recommendation by authority
   figures, information mistrust and conspiracy beliefs) as part of a
   COVID-19 seroprevalence study. Confirmatory factor analysis followed by
   multiple logistic regression models adjusting for relevant covariates
   were used to identify vaccine perceptions uniquely associated with (a)
   intention to get the COVID-19 vaccine (intention), and (b) intention to
   get vaccinated right away (urgency). ResultsIn total, 95.4\% of
   participants of the seroprevalence study completed the vaccine
   questionnaire, corresponding to 17.7\% of the target population. Vaccine
   intention was associated with staff who valued expert recommendations
   (AOR = 10.5, 95\% CI = 7.39-14.90) accepted routine vaccines (AOR =
   1.94, 95\% CI = 1.26-2.98) and perceived higher benefits (AOR = 1.29,
   95\% CI = 1.01-1.65) and lower safety risks of vaccination (AOR = 0.40,
   95\% CI = 0.29-0.54). Comparable associations were found with vaccine
   urgency. Perceived susceptibility to the COVID-19 virus was uniquely
   associated with vaccine urgency (AOR = 1.30, 95\% CI = 1.05-1.61). A
   significant interaction effect (p = 0.01) revealed that staff who
   expressed mistrust in COVID-19 information intended to get vaccinated
   only if they also perceived high benefits of vaccination.
   ConclusionsEducation about the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccines
   from a trusted source had the strongest relationship with vaccine
   intentions among this occupational group. Notably, those who expressed
   mistrust in information still intended to get vaccinated if they also
   perceived strong benefits of the vaccine.},

Title = {Factors affecting intention to take COVID-19 vaccine among Pakistani
   University Students},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Background
   Widespread vaccination coverage is essential for reducing the COVID-19
   havoc and regarded as a crucial tool in restoring normal life on
   university campuses. Therefore, our research aimed to understand the
   intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19 among Pakistani university
   students.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study was conducted in five administrative units of
   Pakistan, i.e., Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and
   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. We obtained data from 2,865 university students
   between 17th January and 2nd February, 2021, using a semi-structured and
   self-administered questionnaire. We used Stata (version 16.1, StataCorp
   LLC) for data management and analysis.
   Results
   The majority (72.5\%) of our respondents were willing to take COVID-19
   vaccine. The current level of education had a statistically significant
   relationship with the intention to be vaccinated (p < 0.05). Respondents
   answered 11 questions encompassing five different domains of the Health
   Belief Model (HBM). All the items of HBM were significantly associated
   with the positive intention towards receiving the vaccine (p < 0.05). We
   conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the
   relative contribution of different factors towards the intention to
   receive COVID-19 vaccine. Multiple factors such as belief that
   vaccination should be mandatory for everyone (AOR: 3.99, 95\% CI:
   3.20-4.98) and willingness to take vaccine even if it is not free (AOR:
   3.91, 95\% CI: 3.18-4.81) were observed to be associated with high odds
   of showing willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
   Conclusion
   Most of our study participants intended to take vaccines based on their
   belief regarding the high effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine. But as
   rumor-mongers are generating and spreading conspiracy theories daily,
   the health department and policymakers need to undertake evidence-based
   campaigns through electronic and social media to ensure expected
   countrywide vaccination coverage. In this case, our study findings can
   serve as a foundation for them to ensure mass vaccination coverage among
   university students, which is crucial now to reopen the dormitories and
   restore everyday life on campuses.},

Title = {PubMedInfo Crawler: An innovative extraction process that leads towards
   biological information mining},
Journal = {META GENE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: During last decades, an extraordinary improvement of
   bioinformatics has been observed that has prompted growth of a huge
   measure of biological data. The Bioinformatics and computational science
   aim to manage this huge volume of information. In the way biological
   data can be extracted, producing scientific knowledge, handling and
   mining huge information is at present a subject of incredible conspiracy
   and significance. Automation particularly in the information extraction
   step might be an essential technique to lessen the time important to
   finish an efficient research. However, the state of the art of
   automatically extricating information components from biological
   databases has not been all around portrayed.
   Methods: Systematically PubMedInfo Crawler will identify potentially
   relevant articles and their details against different keywords. The
   included methodology met the following criteria: 1) Get keywords from
   user, send request to eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, fetch results from this
   server and then generate database to display output containing title and
   links of articles found against given keywords. 2) Transform these links
   into useful and structured form to get detailed information of each
   article: like PubMed id, title, abstract, journal name, authors' name,
   publication date and country name to which authors belong. 3) Analyze
   the obtained details from different aspects that are discussed in detail
   in the methodology section.
   Results: PubMedInfo Crawler (PMIC) has been developed to provide data
   extraction utilities for commonly used database PubMed. It is a simple
   web interface that enables input of query in the form of keyword and
   generates detailed useful information of each article against input
   keyword. Tool has been experimentally tested on different query keywords
   and has validated the results from PubMed. The overall accuracy of the
   crawler was found to be 96\% for the number of articles against query
   terms. The tool is freely avaialble.
   Conclusion: This tools with help the public users to extract the data
   from Pubmed through an automatic way with less consumption of time.
   Furthermore it will help the researchers to accomplish their research in
   a better way with less effort.},

Title = {Deceitful Tongues: Is Climate Change Denial a Crime?},
Journal = {ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY},

Volume = {39},

Pages = {831-894},
Abstract = {The consequences of global warming and associated climate changes are
   now apparent. No longer can there be any doubt that anthropogenic
   (human-caused) warming of the Earth is happening, caused mainly by
   greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide, from burning fossil
   fuels. Climate change poses a grave threat to humankind The world is
   already experiencing the consequences of global warming: more frequent
   and prolonged droughts, increasingly severe and more frequent storms,
   rising sea levels worldwide threatening coastal and vulnerable island
   populations, the melting of mountain glaciers and polar ice sheets,
   increased intensity of tropical cyclones and hurricanes, and more
   frequent and widespread fires. Without immediate action to curb
   greenhouse gas emissions, climate change can only get worse. In the
   period since the issue of global warming was brought to the attention of
   the general public in the late 1980s, both the legislative and the
   executive branches of the United States government have launched a
   number of initiatives to assess the threat and formulate policies to
   address it. Nevertheless, two decades later the United States government
   has failed to take effective measures to address climate change
   domestically or to assert international leadership on achieving
   meaningful carbon emission reductions. It is now well-documented that a
   shift in public opinion and failure of political will on climate change
   took place at the turn of the millennium, a change which can be largely
   attributed to a sophisticated, nationwide public relations campaign
   designed to conceal the dangers of burning fossil fuels from the
   American public by deceiving it as to the true state of climate science.
   Yet this deception is arguably punishable as criminal fraud under
   several United States statutes: first, as defrauding the public under
   the generic mail/wire fraud statute; and second, as defrauding the
   United States government under the ``conspiracy to defraud the United
   States{''} statute. This Article examines whether it can be regarded as
   a crime based not just upon the unethical motives of its perpetrators,
   but on its effects: the catastrophic, global devastation which is the
   likely outcome of its success.},

Abstract = {We investigate a one-zone chemophotometric evolution model of disk-disk
   galaxy mergers in order to clarify whether galaxy mergers with a widely
   spread merging epoch can reproduce reasonably well the observed small
   scatter of the color-magnitude (C-hl) relation in cluster ellipticals at
   low and intermediate redshift (z < 1). We consider that
   merger-progenitor disks begin to consume interstellar gas at a moderate
   rate from z similar to 5 and then merge to form an elliptical with a
   secondary starburst at z = z(merge). We find that even if the epoch of
   galaxy merging is rather extended (0.3 < z(merge) < 3.0), the dispersion
   in the rest-frame U-V color among galaxy mergers is well within the
   observed one (similar to 0.05 mag at z = 0). We also find that the
   z(merge) is required to be within a certain range to keep the observed
   C-M relation tight at a given z. For example, the required range of
   z(merge) in galaxy mergers between Sa disks is 1.3 < z(merge) < 3.0 for
   cluster ellipticals at z = 0.895, 0.9 < z(merge) < 3.0 for z = 0.55, and
   0.3 < z(merge) < 3.0 for z = 0. The main reason for the derived small
   scatter is that younger stellar populations, which are formed during the
   secondary starburst of galaxy mergers, are formed preferentially from
   more metal-enriched interstellar gas. This result reinforces Worthey's
   suggestion of 1996 that the age-metallicity conspiracy, which means that
   younger stellar populations are preferentially more metal-enriched, can
   operate to keep the tight C-M relation. These numerical results imply
   that the observed small scatter in the C-M relation at low and
   intermediate redshift (z < 1) does not necessarily require the coevality
   of elliptical galaxies in clusters or their formation at high z, which
   has been conventionally believed in the classical, passive evolution
   picture.},

Abstract = {The article considers the main approaches to the study of social
   optimism as a socio-psychological phenomenon, highlights its theoretical
   structure and functions. The results of a longitudinal empirical study
   conducted among adult Russians (N = 664, six measurements) from March 3
   to December 26, 2022 and aimed at identifying the socio-psychological
   antecedents of the stability of social optimism in the conditions of
   crisis are presented. It is shown that social optimism is directly
   related to personal characteristics that underlie the resilience:
   self-efficacy, perceived control, dispositional optimism, positive
   reframing and seeking emotional support in a critical situation. The
   study reveals that perceived control increases the stability of the
   individual's social optimism in a crisis. The higher the social
   well-being of the individual, the belief in his ability to contribute to
   the development of society, the more stable is social optimism. The
   hypothesis is confirmed that social optimism is enhanced by
   socio-psychological characteristics that facilitate the consolidation of
   efforts for a joint response to the challenges of the crisis: civic
   identity; perceived social support; empathy for others affected by the
   war; generalized trust; trust in civil society institutions; as well as
   political self-efficacy, that is, the belief in the ability to influence
   political decisions made in the country. On the contrary, social
   optimism is negatively associated with belief in a dangerous world,
   social cynicism, and a conspiracy worldview. The main contribution to
   the stability of social optimism is made by collective political
   self-efficacy, while social cynicism accelerates its decline. The
   results of the study made it possible to suggest the existence of two
   complementary mechanisms for maintaining social optimism: through
   strengthening civic identification and the importance of the collective
   future for the individual (this role is played by moral foundations of
   respect for authority, loyalty to one's group and sanctity) and through
   empathy and strengthening the importance of mutual assistance in a
   crisis (under the influence of ``individualizing{''} moral foundations
   of caring for people and fairness).},

Title = {Public beliefs and willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccines among adults
   in South-Western Nigeria: A cross-sectional study},
Journal = {AIMS PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},

Pages = {1-15},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the government's and development partners' unmatched
   efforts to ensure that every eligible person receives vaccinations,
   there have been concerns about vaccine fear, government mistrust,
   vaccine hesitancy and rejection expressed by the public, as well as
   various conspiracy theories involving the COVID-19 vaccines. This study
   assessed the public beliefs and willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccines
   and related factors among residents of Ondo State, Nigeria. Methods:
   Using a convenience sample technique, a cross-sectional survey of the
   adult population was carried out in the months of February and March of
   2022. Factors influencing beliefs and willingness to accept COVID-19
   vaccines were found by using univariate and multivariate statistical
   analysis. Results: 306 out of 323 respondents completed the survey and
   were included in the final analysis. The respondents mean age was 28.16
   +/- 16.2 years. Although n = 223, 72.9\% of respondents reported to have
   received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccines, (n = 205) 67.0\%
   believed COVID-19 vaccines to be effective. Among the individuals who
   had not yet had any COVID-19 vaccinations, 2.6\% (n = 8) of respondents
   were willing to accept the vaccines, whereas 14.1\% (n = 43) were
   unwilling. Respondents' beliefs about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines
   were influenced by their gender, occupation, religion and educational
   attainment (p < 0.005). Conclusion: The study revealed a good level of
   positive beliefs about the vaccine, which was mirrored in vaccination
   history. However, those who had not yet received the vaccine were
   unwilling to do so, opening the door for more aggressive risk
   communication to be able to alter the course of events. In addition to
   addressing additional COVID-19 vaccination myths, we advise
   policy-makers to develop communication strategies that emphasise the
   safety of the COVID-19 vaccine. It is advised that all relevant
   stakeholders be included in government COVID-19 vaccination programmes
   by sharing timely, transparent information that fosters accountability.},

Abstract = {Background The myths and conspiracy theories on the COVID-19 vaccine
   cause people to be hesitant and maleficent towards the vaccine.
   Objectives To assess COVID-19 vaccine-related awareness, attitude and
   acceptance and to assess reasons for refusing the vaccine among
   undergraduate Jimma University Institute of Health students. Methods A
   cross-sectional study was conducted among 387 undergraduate students of
   Jimma University Institute of Health. Self-administered questionnaires
   were used to collect the data and summarized by descriptive statistics.
   A multivariable regression model was used to assess predictable
   variables for good awareness and positive attitude. A p value of < 0.05
   was used to declare the statistical association. Results Only 41\% of
   the students had a good awareness of the COVID-19 vaccine, and more than
   half, 224 (57.9\%) of them had a positive attitude towards the COVID-19
   vaccine. Age {[}(AOR: 95\% CI) 1.18 (1.03, 1.35)] and having good
   awareness {[}(AOR: 95\% CI) 2.39 (1.55, 3.68)] were associated with
   positive attitude of students towards the COVID-19 vaccine. However,
   only 27.1\% of the students were willing to take the vaccine for
   COVID-19. Afraid of long term effects (49.1\%), not being convinced of
   the safety standards (38.8\%), lack of information about the vaccine
   (37.2\%), and too short time for development (39.9\%) was common reasons
   for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions According to the present
   study, the majority of the participants had a positive attitude towards
   COVID-19 vaccine. However, only less than half of the participants had a
   good awareness of the vaccine. In addition, the acceptability of the
   vaccine is low. Afraid of long term effects, not being convinced of the
   safety profile, lack of information about the vaccine, and the time used
   for the development were the common reasons for refusing the vaccine.
   Therefore, all stakeholders are advised to increase awareness, positive
   attitude, and acceptance of the vaccine.},

Title = {DIPLOMATS, POLITICIANS AND FOREIGN POLICY IN POST-WAR ITALY},

Abstract = {The role of diplomacy in post-war Italian foreign policy increased as
   Italian politics polarized around two mass parties, the Christian
   Democrats and the Communists, taking their cues respectively from
   Washington (and the Vatican) and from Moscow. A domestic ``diplomatic
   conspiracy{''} can be evoked, bent upon preserving and promoting
   essential foreign policy tenets, with respect to national politicians
   who, both in government and opposition, reacted to external events
   rather mechanically, indifferently, half-way between pragmatic
   expediency and lofty idealism. Unable to express strong national
   convictions and uncomfort with having to take sides, Italy displayed an
   inclination for multilateral forums. While holding firm to its
   international moorings, it indulged in occasional drifts, always
   dispensing with the need to declare its own vital interests. Even though
   endowed with broad (at times contradictory) instructions, Italian
   diplomacy performed quite effectively and credibly in the European
   Communities, in NATO and towards the `hird world', achieving a
   visibility somewhat higher than the country's actual influence would
   have allowed. After the Cold War, the very structure of party politics
   disintegrated and foreign policy was relegated anew to the background,
   just when world events accelerated dramatically. Nowadays, Italy finds
   itself back to square one, and this time without the same type of a
   safety net from NATO or the EU. Hard choices present themselves to a
   country suddenly bereft of the clear international coordinates that have
   kept it going so far. Nevertheless, foreign policy has finally become
   largely bipartisan. The 919 career diplomats were entrusted with more
   creative and proactive political tasks than the current `conomic
   diplomacy' that they are presently asked to devote themselves to
   (supported financially by only 0.23\% of the national budget, 0.11\% of
   the GNP). The Secretary General of the Foreign Ministry, Ambassador
   Massolo, maintains that ``With the appropriate mix of realism and
   long-tem vision{''}, Italian diplomacy should ``pursue a stable
   inclusion of our country in the new equations that are consolidating at
   the global level{''}; warning however that ``in order to be in Europe,
   we must be well-structured nationally{''}.},

Title = {Analysis of Perception, Reasons, and Motivations for COVID-19
   Vaccination in People with Diabetes across Sub-Saharan Africa: A
   Mixed-Method Approach},

Abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with severe COVID-19 infection and
   complications. This study assesses COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and
   hesitancy in people with DM, and explores the reasons for not being
   vaccinated. This was a web-based cross-sectional survey using a
   mixed-method approach conducted in March-May 2021, corresponding to most
   Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries' early vaccine rollout period.
   Participants were those aged >= 18 years with self-reported DM in 11
   Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Responses to comments on the
   reasons for vaccine hesitancy and facilitators for vaccine uptake were
   analyzed. Of the 73 participants with DM, 65.8\% were males, older than
   35 years (86.3\%), had postsecondary education (90\%), and a significant
   proportion were from South Africa (39.7\%), Nigeria (28.8\%) and Ghana
   (13.7\%). At the time of this study, 64.4\% experienced COVID-19
   symptoms, 46.6\% were tested for COVID-19, of which 19.2\% tested
   positive. Few participants (6.8\%) had received a COVID-19 vaccination,
   65.8\% were willing to take the vaccine when it becomes available in
   their country, while 26.0\% either refused or remained hesitant towards
   taking the vaccine. The main identified reasons for not taking the
   vaccine were: advice from religious leaders; concerns about the safety,
   effects, and efficacy of the vaccines; mistrust of the pharmaceutical
   companies producing the vaccines and the process of production; the
   conspiracy theories around the vaccines; and the personal belief of the
   participants regarding vaccination. However, participants stated they
   would take the vaccine if they were more educated about it, received
   positive feedback from those vaccinated, were rewarded for taking the
   vaccine, or if vaccination became a condition for travel and employment.
   In conclusion, this study shows that the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine
   was very low in this high-risk group. Efforts to increase the uptake of
   COVID-19 vaccines among people with diabetes are imperative, such as the
   provision of education and relevant information.},

Abstract = {This article concerns the role of criminal law in modern, post-New Deal
   labor relations. I emphasize the continuing function of the criminal law
   in limiting basic labor rights (to organize, strike, and provoke
   collective bargaining) as reflected in several common practices: the
   prosecution of labor organizing and protest activity as crimes; the
   persistent use of injunctions by the courts to curtail labor rights; and
   the indirect use of the criminal law by the courts and the NLRB to
   define unfair labor practices and to limit the scope of worker
   protections under the labor law. I hope to show how these functions
   reflect both change and continuity relative to the criminal law in
   pre-New Deal times.
   The modern criminal law's labor-repressive functions are far less crude
   and overt, and administered in a far more professional fashion, than in
   the days when criminal conspiracy, syndicalism, and vagrancy laws, for
   example, were used so extensively and blatantly to undermine labor
   rights. And rather than simply destroying labor rights, these functions
   operate alongside, and are incorporated into, a body of labor law
   designed to protect labor rights. On the one hand, this shift has been
   of real benefit to labor, allowing workers and organizers much more
   freedom in their struggles with employers. On the other hand, I argue,
   modern criminal law still plays a significant role in limiting labor
   rights. The very factors that now ease the criminal law's impact on
   workers-the subtlety, professionalism, and procedural regularity with
   which it is applied, and its coexistence alongside a functional system
   of labor laws-also obscure and rationalize its real effects on labor
   rights, making it easier for governments to use the criminal law against
   labor and harder for labor activists to challenge such practices. My
   goal is to help unmask these functions of the criminal law with the hope
   that organized labor and its supporters might better work against and
   around them.},

Title = {COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy concerns: Findings from a Ghana clinical
   radiography workforce survey},

Abstract = {Introduction: Vaccination is a key global strategy to mitigate the
   clinical impact of the COVID-19 virus. As part of local efforts to
   manage the outbreak, the government of Ghana announced its intention to
   vaccinate its population starting with essential and high-risk workers
   including radiographers. However, there were reports of hesitance to
   receiving the vaccine among the radiography workforce. This study was
   undertaken prior to the intended vaccination exercise to assess the
   willingness and concerns of radiographers to undergo the COVID-19
   vaccination and to suggest recommendations to improve the vaccine
   uptake. Methods: An ethically-approved online survey strategy was
   employed for this cross-sectional study conducted between 24th-28th
   February 2021. The survey employed quantitative questions and open text
   response options. Quantitative and open text responses were analysed
   using statistical and thematic analyses, respectively. Results: There
   were 108 responses (response rate of 46.3\%). The majority (n = 64,
   59.3\%) were willing to have the vaccine, however, some (n = 44, 40.7\%)
   were not. The main reason behind their willingness to have the vaccine
   was its ability to reduce the spread of infections and lower mortality
   (n = 35, 54.7\%). However, doubts about the vaccine's efficacy and side
   effects (n = 26, 56.8\%), conspiracy theory concerns about its effects
   on the Ghanaian race (n = 4, 9.1\%), and fertility concerns (n = 2,
   4.5\%) were some reasons for their hesitance to receive the vaccine. The
   open text commentary further revealed that the vaccine was thought of as
   a lifesaving medication, however, clinical safety concerns, lack of
   education/information and religious beliefs were affecting peoples'
   willingness to be vaccinated. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the
   need for an urgent public health educational intervention to address the
   COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy concerns raised by radiographers to help
   increase the vaccine uptake. Implication for practice: The study
   provides pertinent information to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake among
   radiographers to limit the spread of infections.(c) 2021 The College of

Title = {How did the public respond to the 2015 expert consensus public health
   guidance statement on workplace sedentary behaviour? A qualitative
   analysis},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Background: In June 2015, an expert consensus guidance statement was
   published recommending that office workers accumulate 2-4 h of standing
   and light activity daily and take regular breaks from prolonged sitting.
   This paper describes public responses to media coverage of the guidance,
   so as to understand public acceptability of the recommendations within
   the guidance, and perceptions of sitting and standing as health
   behaviours.
   Methods: UK news media websites that had reported on the sedentary
   workplace guidance statement, and permitted viewers to post comments
   responding to the story, were identified. 493 public comments, posted in
   a one-month period to one of six eligible news media websites, were
   thematically analysed.
   Results: Three themes were extracted: (1) challenges to the credibility
   of the sedentary workplace guidance; (2) challenges to the credibility
   of public health; and (3) the guidance as a spur to knowledge exchange.
   Challenges were made to the novelty of the guidance, the credibility of
   its authors, the strength of its evidence base, and its applicability to
   UK workplaces. Public health was commonly mistrusted and viewed as a
   tool for controlling the public, to serve a paternalistic agenda set by
   a conspiracy of stakeholders with hidden non-health interests. Knowledge
   exchanges focused on correcting others' misinterpretations, raising
   awareness of historical or scientific context, debating current
   workplace health policies, and sharing experiences around sitting and
   standing.
   Conclusions: The guidance provoked exchanges of health-promoting ideas
   among some, thus demonstrating the potential for sitting reduction
   messages to be translated into everyday contexts by lay champions.
   However, findings also demonstrated confusion, misunderstanding and
   misapprehension among some respondents about the health value of sitting
   and standing. Predominantly unfavourable, mistrusting responses reveal
   significant hostility towards efforts to displace workplace sitting with
   standing, and towards public health science more broadly. Concerns about
   the credibility and purpose of public health testify to the importance
   of public engagement in public health guidance development.},

Title = {Slave rebellion and the conundrum of cosmopolitanism: Placido and <i>La
   Escalera</i> in a neglected Cuban antislavery novel by Orihuela},
Journal = {ATLANTIC STUDIES-GLOBAL CURRENTS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {209-230},
Abstract = {In 1852, Andres Avelino de Orihuela, a white Canary Island immigrant to
   Cuba in exile in Paris, translated Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's
   Cabin twice. After publishing La cabana del tio Tom, he then translated
   Stowe in a different way: he wrote a Cuban antislavery novel. In El Sol
   de Jesus del Monte, Eduardo, a white lawyer, embodies the conundrum of
   race within cosmopolitanism: he professes to be an egalitarian citizen
   of the world, yet betrays his mulatto lover Matilde for a white woman.
   The novel places Matilde's personal tragedy in the context of the
   colonial government's destruction of the community of free people of
   color during La Escalera (18431844), a series of antislavery and
   anticolonial conspiracies. In this sentimental melodrama that elicits
   sympathy for victims of racism, Eduardo's rejection of Matilde signifies
   a failed unification of whites and Afro-Cubans in a national romance a
   la Doris Sommer. When Matilde's family flees to Veracruz and builds a
   new life Matilde marries a Mexican mestizo mulattoes do not appear
   subordinate to whites, as in Uncle Tom's Cabin, but instead embody the
   mixed-race future of Latin America.
   The novel's focus on the racial contradictions of Eduardo's self-styled
   cosmopolitanism constitutes Orihuela's critical, vernacular
   cosmopolitanism (Homi Bhabha). I argue that Orihuela's critique of Cuban
   exiles collusion with the colonial government's vilification of Placido
   and repression of free people of color exposes a new permutation of a
   longstanding racial contradiction in Latin American republicanism.
   Indeed, Simon Bolivar assassinated two prominent mulatto leaders in the
   1820s for allegedly promoting race over nation. Bolivar had opposed
   slavery, yet limited democracy to ward off a repeat of the Haitian
   Revolution in Gran Colombia (Aline Helg). At a time when antislavery
   novels reinforced racist discourses, El Sol de Jesus del Monte
   unflinchingly points to white racism as the main challenge facing the
   would-be egalitarian republics of Latin America},

Title = {Users' Reactions to Announced Vaccines Against COVID-19 Before Marketing
   in France: Analysis of Twitter Posts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Background: Within a few months, the COVID-19 pandemic had spread to
   many countries , had been a real challenge for health systems all around
   the world. This unprecedented crisis has led to a surge of online
   discussions about potential cures for the disease. Among them, vaccines
   have been at the heart of the debates and have faced lack of confidence
   before marketing in France.
   Objective: This study aims to identify and investigate the opinions of
   French Twitter users on the announced vaccines against COVID-19 through
   sentiment analysis.Methods: This study was conducted in 2 phases. First,
   we filtered a collection of tweets related to COVID-19 available on
   Twitter from February 2020 to August 2020 with a set of keywords
   associated with vaccine mistrust using word embeddings. Second, we
   performed sentiment analysis using deep learning to identify the
   characteristics of vaccine mistrust. The model was trained on a
   hand-labeled subset of 4548 tweets.
   Results: A set of 69 relevant keywords were identified as the semantic
   concept of the word ``vaccin{''} (vaccine in French) and focused mainly
   on conspiracies, pharmaceutical companies , alternative treatments.
   Those keywords enabled us to extract nearly 350,000 tweets in French.
   The sentiment analysis model achieved 0.75 accuracy. The model then
   predicted 16\% of positive tweets, 41\% of negative tweets, and 43\% of
   neutral tweets. This allowed us to explore the semantic concepts of
   positive and negative tweets and to plot the trends of each sentiment.
   The main negative rhetoric identified from users' tweets was that
   vaccines are perceived as having a political purpose and that COVID-19
   is a commercial argument for the pharmaceutical companies.
   Conclusions: Twitter might be a useful tool to investigate the arguments
   for vaccine mistrust because it unveils political criticism contrasting
   with the usual concerns on adverse drug reactions. As the opposition
   rhetoric is more consistent and more widely spread than the positive
   rhetoric, we believe that this research provides effective tools to help
   health authorities better characterize the risk of vaccine mistrust.},

Title = {Between Political Conservatism and Economic Liberalism: Carl Friedrich
   Goerdeler and His Concept of ``the Other Germany{''} after the Overthrow
   of the Nazi Dictatorship},

Abstract = {The article deals with the professional biography, economic and
   political views as well as the intellectual heritage of Carl Friedrich
   Goerdeler (1884-1945), the mayor of Leipzig (1930-1936) and state
   commissar for price control (1931-1932; 1934-1935). At the end of the
   1930s he became one of the key figures of the civil resistance movement
   in National Socialist Germany. Based on many years of his professional
   experience, his views and value system, the authoritative leader of the
   conservative bourgeois wing of the German anti-totalitarian opposition
   spoke out with open criticism of the destructive financial and economic
   policies of the authorities and warned about the disastrous consequences
   of the destruction of the rule of law and the dissolution of moral
   standards as well as the spread of corruption and arbitrariness in the
   inhuman political system of the Third Reich. In his many memory and
   expert reports, he sought ways to reorganize the economy and the society
   of ``the other Germany{''}. After overthrowing the Nazi dictatorship, he
   intended to take the position of German chancellor. His academic
   collaboration with professors from Freiburg - the architects of the
   theory of ``effective competition order{''} - with whom he intensely
   discussed the perspective of institutional reconstruction of the
   economic and social life in Germany after the fall of the totalitarian
   regime, allows us to indirectly rank this opposition politician among
   the ideological forerunners of the concept of Social Market Economy in
   the early Federal Republic of Germany. After the failure of the
   conspiracy against Hitler on July 20, 1944, Goerdeler was arrested and
   sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out in February 1945 in the
   Berlin Ploetzensee prison. This study aims to acquaint the Russian
   reader with less-known aspects of the life and work of a prominent
   representative of the civilian resistance movement in National Socialist
   Germany as well as to identify the characteristics of right-conservative
   ideas regarding the principles of state organization and implementation
   of economic policy, and in general to pay attention to the peculiarity
   of the German intellectual opposition thought.},

Title = {``No one says `No' to money{''} - a mixed methods approach for
   evaluating conditional cash transfer schemes to improve girl children's
   status in Haryana, India},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Introduction: Haryana was the first state in India to launch a
   conditional cash transfer (CCT) scheme in 1994. Initially it targeted
   all disadvantaged girls but was revised in 2005 to restrict it to second
   girl children of all groups. The benefit which accrued at girl attaining
   18 years and subject to conditionalities of being fully immunized,
   studying till class 10 and remaining unmarried, was increased from about
   US\$ 500 to US\$ 2000. Using a mixed methods approach, we evaluated the
   implementation and possible impact of these two schemes.
   Methods: A survey was conducted among 200 randomly selected respondents
   of Ballabgarh Block in Haryana to assess their perceptions of girl
   children and related schemes. A cohort of births during this period was
   assembled from population database of 28 villages in this block and
   changes in sex ratio at birth and in immunization coverage at one year
   of age among boys and girls was measured. Education levels and mean age
   at marriage of daughters were compared with daughters-in-law from
   outside Haryana. In-depth interviews were conducted among district level
   implementers of these schemes to assess their perceptions of programs'
   implementation and impact. These were analyzed using a thematic
   approach.
   Results: The perceptions of girls as a liability and poor (9\% to 15\%)
   awareness of the schemes was noted. The cohort analysis showed that
   while there has been an improvement in the indicators studied, these
   were similar to those seen among the control groups. Qualitative
   analysis identified a ``conspiracy of silence{''} - an underplaying of
   the pervasiveness of the problem coupled with a passive implementation
   of the program and a clash between political culture of giving subsidies
   and a bureaucratic approach that imposed many conditionalities and
   documentary needs for availing of benefits.
   Conclusion: The apparent lack of impact on the societal mindset calls
   for a revision in the current approach of addressing a social issue by a
   purely conditional cash transfer program.},

Title = {THE FIGHTING OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY AGAINST ``BOURGEOIS TELEVISION{''}},
Journal = {ACTA HISTORICA TALLINNENSIA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {108-141},
Abstract = {In the 1950s the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had a monopoly on
   information, which was subverted by several radio stations on the other
   side of the Iron Curtain. Since the second half of the 1960s the
   government of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic faced even a more
   serious problem: the signals of Finnish ``bourgeois television{''} were
   broadcasted into Soviet Estonia. The Communist Party tried to struggle
   against bourgeois ``ideological diversion{''} by implementing technical
   means, for example hindering shops from selling audio blocks. These were
   essential devices that enabled watching Finnish television. In addition,
   mass media was used to ``reveal{''} conspiracies of the West's hostile
   propaganda machine. The Estonian Communist Party (EKP) used public
   opinion polls to monitor enemy's ``propaganda action{''} and its
   consequences. The polls showed that Finnish television programmes were
   richer in content and catchier compared to the Estonian National
   Television Channel (ETV). Also, the information shown on Finnish
   television was immediate and objective; therefore, it was more
   interesting and reliable than the information provided by ETV. However,
   it seemed that the Estonian Communist Party found a solution how to
   avoid increasing the number of the people watching Finnish television
   channels as well as winning back the Estonian audience from the
   ``capitalist television{''} - by ``covering{''} bourgeois television. It
   was decided that ETV would broadcast more exciting, informative, and
   topical programmes. Despite the great effort's, Estonians continued
   watching Finnish television until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In
   the present article archival materials were studied to find out the
   reasons why it was difficult, even impossible for ETV to ``cover{''}
   Finnish television during the period 1968-1988. The research results
   showed that ``covering{''} Finnish television would have been much more
   effective if there had not been some serious problems, e.g. ignoring the
   audience, insufficient working conditions of the ill-equipped ETV,
   workforce problems, lack of information among journalists, and
   ideological-political constraints.},

   Policy Initiatives in 1716 - 1721},
Journal = {MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Pages = {110-126},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the role of tsarist doctors in solving several
   foreign policy issues in Russia during the reign of Peter the Great. It
   analyzes the activities of two doctors - Robert Areskin and George
   Polikala. Areskin played a crucial role in Peter I `s communication with
   the Jacobites under deteriorating relations between Russia and England
   in 1717-1718. Polikala, in turn, assisted the Russian government in
   several interactions with the Ottoman Empire.
   Sources indicate that R. Areskin was the leading lobbyist for the idea
   of the Russian government supporting James III Stuart. With the help of
   his relatives, who actively supported the overthrown dynasty, Areskin
   negotiated with representatives of the Swedish King Charles XII and with
   other European diplomats during the second European trip of Peter the
   Great. The diplomatic scandal of early 1717 connected to the disclosure
   of another Jacobite conspiracy involving the official circles of Sweden
   affected Areskin's endeavors. During these events, the doctor's secret
   negotiations with representatives of a state at war with Russia became
   public. Despite the official assurances of Peter the Great and Areskin
   about their non-involvement in the activities of the opponents of King
   George I of England, negotiations with the Jacobites continued later,
   during the tsar's stay in France and Holland. Areskin remained the main
   initiator of these contacts even after Peter I returned to Russia, which
   only aggravated the problematic relations with England. However, the
   death of the tsar's doctor led to the fact that the ``Jacobite
   intrigue{''} in Russia was over.
   Medic G.Polikala was involved in the activities of Russian diplomacy in
   Turkey. In particular, he had contacts with the Russian envoy in
   Istanbul, P.A. Tolstoy, and attempted to withdraw A. Cantemir from the
   territory of the Ottoman Empire. Unfortunately, the information about
   Polikala's participation in Peter l's secret diplomacy events is
   sketchy.
   The article concludes that the tsarist doctors played an essential role
   in implementing the foreign policy initiatives of Peter I.},

Abstract = {The life of Grigori Rasputin does not stop surprising us in spite of
   almost hundred years passed after his dramatic murder, in December,
   1916. It is difficult to deal, in a beginning, how a humble Siberian
   rough peasant, dirty and semiilliterate it was capable of coming to the
   Russian Court and, not only it, but to manage to belong with sejero to
   the czars and to influence the highest political Russian sphere for
   several years, coming to be called ``our friend `` for the czars. His
   ascent begins at the beginning of s. The XXth, in the city of Saint
   Petersburg, when it comes to this city of the hand of two prestigious
   orthodox monks (the bishop Hermagenes and the preacher Eliodoro) that
   will facilitate contacts to him with the high company of the city. A
   chance, the disease of the zarevich Alejandro, together with the Saint's
   reputation and miracle-working that has Grigori in Saint Petersburg and
   the contact that has habitual mind with the princess Militsa of
   Montenegro, will make possible the approximation and reception of
   Rasputin in the czarist Court. On having treated the zarevich,
   momentarily of his disease, Rasputin will be considered to be, for the
   mystical tsarina Alejandra, a Saint and, from there, will be an
   indispensable personage for the czars who, from time to time, will call
   him to treat the punctual relapses of the young person Alejandro. The
   excesses and abuses of power -and of any type -committed by Rasputin
   they will provoke a conspiracy to finish with his life that will be
   materialized, in December, 1916, by the prince Yus pov pound (as himself
   counts it in his memories) together with a series of persons belonging
   to the diverse ones Social Russian classes (officials of the army,
   politicians, aristocrats, members of the family of the czar.) and
   enclosed agents of the secret British service.},

Abstract = {BackgroundVaccine hesitancy causes serious difficulties in vaccination
   campaigns in many countries. The study of the population's attitude
   toward vaccination and detection of the predictive important individual
   psychological and social factors defining the vaccination necessity
   perception will allow elaborating promoting vaccination adherence
   measures. ObjectivesThe aim of this research was to study COVID-19
   threat appraisal, fear of COVID-19, trust in COVID-19 information
   sources, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and the relationship of
   sociodemographic variables to COVID-19 preventive behavior. MethodsWe
   carried out a cohort cross-sectional study of the population's attitude
   toward vaccination against the novel COVID-19 coronavirus infection,
   using a specially designed questionnaire for an online survey. Totally,
   there were 4,977 respondents, ranging in age from 18 to 81 years.
   Statistical assessment was carried out using the SPSS-11 program.
   ResultsThere were different attitudes toward vaccination. Among
   respondents, 34.2\% considered vaccination to be useful, 31.1\% doubted
   its effectiveness, and 9.9\% considered vaccination unnecessary. The
   survey indicated that 7.4\% of respondents were indifferent to the
   vaccine, while 12.2\% deemed it to be dangerous. Nearly one-third
   (32.3\%) of respondents indicated that they did not plan to be
   vaccinated, while another third (34.0\%) would postpone their decision
   until more comprehensive data on the results and effectiveness of
   vaccination were available. Only 11.6\% of the respondents were
   vaccinated at the time of the study. Young people were less focused on
   vaccination compared to middle-aged and elderly people. Receiving
   information concerning COVID-19 vaccination from healthcare workers and
   scientific experts was associated with greater vaccination acceptance.
   ConclusionThe study results showed that vaccination attitudes interacted
   with individuals' mental health and various sociodemographic factors.
   Insofar as reports of physicians and experts are essential for shaping
   attitudes to vaccination, the study results inform the selection of
   target groups in need of particular psychosocial interventions to
   overcome their vaccine hesitancy.},

Title = {ON THE MYTHOLOGICAL SONGS OF THE ``ELDER EDDA{''} AS A SYSTEM},
Journal = {SKANDINAVSKAYA FILOLOGIYA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-84},
Abstract = {This article is a systemic linguistic and stylistic analysis of the
   corpus of mythological songs of the ``Elder Edda{''} in a wide cultural
   and historical context: folklore, ritual, literary. This approach made
   it possible to propose an interpretation of the mythological songs of
   the ``Elder Edda{''} as a system and take a fresh look at their
   semantics, composition, structure, style and lexical organization. The
   most relevant results of the study of the linguistic and stylistic
   features of the Eddic songs of the mythological cycle can be considered
   the definition of linguo-stylistic features of various genre structures
   in their composition, the explanation of their coexistence, the
   identification of their source and the building of a hierarchy of
   mythological songs of the ``Elder Edda{''} depending on the degree of
   representation in them of various genres. For the first time, the study
   of the mechanism of cultural dynamics makes it possible to use genres,
   plot, structure, images, motives of the Eddic text in the reconstruction
   of the mythopoetic model of the world. The author singles out the most
   representative genres (tula, cosmological and epistemological song,
   vision, memory, conspiracy, competition in wisdom, travel, afterlife
   poetry) and markers (the time of creation, the substance that served as
   material for the creation of the universe, subjects and objects of
   creation), allowing to evaluate their productivity and give a
   comparative description. On the basis of a detailed linguostylistic
   analysis of the mythological cycle of the ``Elder Edda{''}, a different
   degree of closeness between mythological songs is established and their
   plot-genre classification is proposed. The author's scientific
   hypothesis consists in the assumption of the deduction of
   linguostylistic methods of the Eddic cycle from the mythological
   situation of primordial creation, the dominance of the sacred sphere,
   which determines the strategy of the characters' behavior and the
   results of their activities, anthropocentric orientation, which is
   expressed in the description of cosmogenesis in genealogical terms.},

Title = {Sociodemographic and psychological correlates of COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy and resistance in the young adult population in Italy},
Journal = {VACCINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Number = {16},
Pages = {2379-2387},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Background: Previous research has shown that young adults are more
   hesitant/resistant to COVID-19 vac-cine uptake than older age groups,
   although the factors underlying this tendency are still under debate.
   The current study aimed to identify the sociodemographic and
   psychological correlates of vaccine hesitancy and resistance among young
   adults (18-40 years) during the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign
   in Italy, the first country after China being hit by the pandemic and
   which suffered a large number of fatal-ities.Methods: This is a
   cross-sectional, web-based study conducted in Italy using an
   ISO-certified international survey company (respondi.com). Data were
   collected on 1200 participants in June 2021. Results: Vaccine
   hesitancy/resistance was found for 25\% of the sample. In multinomial
   logistic regression (N = 1159), being aged 30-40 years, residing in
   northern Italy, having lower educational and income level, being
   unemployed, and not knowing any friends/relatives diagnosed with
   COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of hesitancy or resistance. In
   multivariate analysis of variance (N =1177), both vaccine hesi-tant and
   resistant young adults perceived significantly less social support from
   friends and family than vaccine accepting ones. Resistant individuals
   reported significantly higher levels of conspiracy theories and negative
   attitudes toward vaccines than their accepting and hesitant
   counterparts. Moreover, resis-tant individuals reported significantly
   lower levels of attachment to country and perceptions of a just
   gov-ernment compared to accepting ones, with hesitant young adults
   scoring in between.Conclusions: Our findings support the idea that young
   adults with a hesitant (vs. resistant) attitude show a more nuanced and
   less extreme psychological profile. Public health messaging should
   capitalize on social media to provide accessible, transparent, and
   age-appropriate information concerning COVID-19 vaccine safety.
   Moreover, policy efforts improving the availability of social support
   systems are warranted to strengthen connectedness and foster trust in
   institutions amongst this particular segment of the population.(c) 2022

Abstract = {The study is devoted to the application of the principles of network
   organization by the Russian revolutionary movement in the second half of
   the 19th - early 20th centuries. The purpose of the study is to evaluate
   the practical experience of using the network structure in organizing
   the movement of Russian revolutionaries. The research methodology is
   based on descriptive, comparative, and structural analysis. The research
   sources were formed based on archival materials, including unpublished
   documents from the funds of the Special Section of the Police Department
   of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Central Committee of the
   Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and the Main Military Court Directorate,
   as well as an extensive corpus of memoirs of contemporaries,
   participants, and opponents of the revolutionary movement. The analysis
   of sources showed that the network structure of the organization is
   formed based on the autonomous activity of the elements. Network
   structures for organizing underground activities were created by various
   revolutionary movements, including Narodnaya Volya, anarchists, social
   democrats, maximalists, socialist-revolutionaries, and Bolsheviks. The
   network organization corresponded to the needs, methods of struggle and
   the illegal position of the Russian revolutionary movement in the
   conditions of the suppression of political radicals by the authorities.
   The formation of ``spider networks{''} allowed the revolutionaries to
   effectively ensure the ``survival{''} of cells, solve problems
   associated with the risks of liquidation and the need for conspiracy,
   minimizing internal splits and social expansion. The network principle
   of organizing a revolutionary movement is recognized as optimal in the
   conditions of underground activity in the absence of a stable connection
   with the governing center and the use of repressive state measures.
   However, the organization of revolutionaries, built on the network
   principle, turned out to be unsuitable for seizing power, both because
   of the low degree of controllability of regional and local divisions,
   and the lack of effective mechanisms for coordinating their actions and
   consolidating resources.},

Title = {Global Infodemiology of COVID-19: Analysis of Google Web Searches and
   Instagram Hashtags},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Background: Although ``infodemiological{''} methods have been used in
   research on coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an examination of the extent
   of infodemic moniker (misinformation) use on the internet remains
   limited.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to investigate internet search
   behaviors related to COVID-19 and examine the circulation of infodemic
   monikers through two platforms-Google and Instagram-during the current
   global pandemic.
   Methods: We have defined infodemic moniker as a term, query, hashtag, or
   phrase that generates or feeds fake news, misinterpretations, or
   discriminatory phenomena. Using Google Trends and Instagram hashtags, we
   explored internet search activities and behaviors related to the
   COVID-19 pandemic from February 20, 2020, to May 6, 2020. We
   investigated the names used to identify the virus, health and risk
   perception, life during the lockdown, and information related to the
   adoption of COVID-19 infodemic monikers. We computed the average peak
   volume with a 95\% CI for the monikers.
   Results: The top six COVID-19-related terms searched in Google were
   ``coronavirus,{''} ``corona,{''} ``COVID,{''} ``virus,{''} ``corona
   virus,{''} and ``COVID-19.{''} Countries with a higher number of
   COVID-19 cases had a higher number of COVID-19 queries on Google. The
   monikers ``coronavirus ozone,{''} ``coronavirus laboratory,{''}
   ``coronavirus 5G,{''} ``coronavirus conspiracy,{''} and ``coronavirus
   bill gates{''} were widely circulated on the internet. Searches on
   ``tips and cures{''} for COVID-19 spiked in relation to the US president
   speculating about a ``miracle cure{''} and suggesting an injection of
   disinfectant to treat the virus. Around two thirds (n=48,700,000,
   66.1\%) of Instagram users used the hashtags ``COVID-19{''} and
   ``coronavirus{''} to disperse virus-related information.
   Conclusions: Globally, there is a growing interest in COVID-19, and
   numerous infodemic monikers continue to circulate on the internet. Based
   on our findings, we hope to encourage mass media regulators and health
   organizers to be vigilant and diminish the use and circulation of these
   infodemic monikers to decrease the spread of misinformation.},

Title = {Social media literacy: fake news consumption and perception of COVID-19
   in Nigeria},
Journal = {COGENT ARTS \& HUMANITIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The emergence of social media in the late 90s resulted in information
   dissemination and consumption transformation. Social networking sites
   have increasingly been popular and appealing to youths, who often spend
   much time navigating across the platforms, exploiting the communication
   affordances. Whereas social media eases the consumption of news and
   information, it nurtures the spread and consumption of fake news which
   tends to influence users' perceptions, particularly, those lacking the
   requisite literacy to guide safe consumption of fake news.
   Unfortunately, during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite
   efforts to enlighten people on the safety measures against the disease,
   the spread of misinformation and disinformation about the pandemic
   through social media platforms tends to undermine adherence to
   preventive measures advised by health experts and results in incautious
   behavior that can worsen, instead of flattening the curve on the
   COVID-19. This study, therefore, examines the students' consumption of
   COVID-19 related fake news on social media and the extent to which
   social media literacy moderates its effect on their perception of the
   disease. A survey design has been adopted, a convenience sampling was
   used where a questionnaire was formed on google form and distributed to
   the students of the two selected polytechnics through Facebook and
   WhatsApp. A total of 108 responses were generated; thus, descriptive and
   T-test analyses were run and the result revealed that the students
   possess the requisite literacy to identify fake news on social media
   platforms, and that has a significant on their perception of COVID-19,
   despite consumption of fake news related to the disease based on the
   T-test p = 0.05. Therefore, the result suggests that the effectiveness
   of media literacy as inoculant moderates the effect of fake news, as
   asserted by the inoculation theorists, it has no bearing on the long
   established stereotypical notion that certain diseases are conspiracies
   to reduce the population of the world.},

Title = {The impact of Muslim and Christian religious leaders responding to
   COVID-19 in Israel},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most significant public
   health emergencies in decades and has affected all countries worldwide.
   Religious leaders have been recognized as playing a pivotal role in
   health promotion during times of crisis. This study explored the role
   that Muslim and Christian religious leaders played in Israel during the
   pandemic, and the impact that their activities had on the community.
   MethodsA qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews was
   conducted with Muslim and Christian religious leaders and health policy
   makers from the Arab community. Intensive purposeful sampling was used
   to locate the two target audiences. Interview protocols were developed
   and included questions about the role they played during the pandemic,
   challenges they faced, and dialogue and partnerships they had.
   Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic
   content analysis. ResultsTen Muslim Sheikhs, three Christian clergy, and
   four health policy makers were interviewed. Religious leaders played a
   predominant role in promoting health during the COVID-19 crisis. Both
   religious leaders and health policy makers reported similar challenges
   including dealing with fake news and the conspiracy theory, social
   events and gatherings, frustrations about gaps in policy toward
   religious institutions, and lack of trust toward State. Health policy
   makers recognized the key role religious leaders played and emphasized
   the importance of engaging religious leaders. ConclusionThe COVID-19
   pandemic has been a catalyst for partnership between health policy
   makers and religious leaders. Religious leaders should play an integral
   and integrated role in promoting health during future health crises, not
   only in implementation of guidelines but also in development of policy
   so that the guidelines are tailored and sensitive to specific
   communities to avoid conflicts. As trusted authorities, religious
   leaders serve as a bridge between health authorities and communities and
   can be mediators who reconcile science, policy and religious
   perspectives. The routine cooperation between decision makers, opinion
   leaders, and religious leaders as social gatekeepers can increase the
   public's level of trust in the system.},

Title = {Russian Constitutionalism and Elections in Noble Assemblies under
   Alexander I},
Journal = {QUAESTIO ROSSICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {848-866},
Abstract = {In historiography, the Russian constitutionalism of the first quarter of
   the nineteenth century has traditionally been considered a result of the
   ideological influence of the European political and legal theories and
   the content of foreign constitutions known to contemporaries. What
   escaped researchers' attention was the influence of the existing
   experience of holding elections in noble assemblies which the authors of
   constitutional projects referred to as a basic model for forming bodies
   of class representation. Electoral practices allowed the emperor and his
   immediate environment to estimate the degree of formation of one of the
   most significant conditions for introducing a constitution in Russia, i.
   e. the fact that the eligible for political rights possessed necessary
   moral qualities, desire, and abilities for partnership in the
   development and discussion of laws. The author analyses archival
   materials from the Russian State Historical Archive, acts, and M. M.
   Speransky's private correspondence with V. P. Kochubey. For the first
   time in national historiography, the article presents recurring problem
   situations deemed by contemporaries as critical, interfering with the
   normal functioning of election systems. The most significant of them was
   the impossibility to draw up electoral lists in due time and
   authentically, reveal and prevent facts of a deliberate distortion of
   data on property, cases of false purchase and sale of manors; lack of
   the necessary number of noblemen who would correspond to all to the
   criteria established by the law and have the skills required; conspiracy
   or bribery of electors by the persons interested in the victory of a
   candidate; cases of ``evasion of duty{''} by already elected candidates.
   Such cases were treated as a manifestation of unworthy behaviour of
   noblemen who turned the election procedure into an instrument of
   negative selection of candidates. Finally, the author concludes that in
   the government circles of Russia in the first quarter of the nineteenth
   century, together with the understanding of the inefficiency of the
   existing local management system, the negative experience of electoral
   practices was an argument for the inopportuneness of introducing a
   constitution.},

Title = {RUSSIA'S CRIMINAL LEGISLATION OF THE 19TH - FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH
   CENTURIES ON ORGANIZED CRIMINAL GROUPS},
Journal = {TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Russian criminal law has long been aware of complicity. However, a more
   concrete and legally perfect definition of complicity was described in
   the Penal Code and Criminal Correction Act of 1845. The Penal Code
   describes two types of collaborative commitment of a crime: the crime
   was committed by several people with prior agreement or without it. A
   prior agreement to commit a crime was seen as the basis for increasing
   the severity of the guilt and, thus, increasing the criminal penalty.
   Certain standards described in the special part of the Penal Code of
   1845 are analyzed as well. This part takes into account certain joint
   criminal activity that occurred outside the frames of the institution of
   complicity, but, at the same time, assumes responsibility for the
   criminal acts of several people: revolt en masse, conspiracy,
   organization of secret societies, and so on. The author devotes special
   attention to the norm that establishes responsibility for organization
   of gangs and gang crimes, considering this form of participation in
   crimes to be the essence of modem organized groups. Through this precise
   lens the author analyzed gangs as a form of joint criminal activity
   described in the wording of the Criminal Law of 1903. The author notes
   that the development of the Soviet criminal law happened quite actively.
   In this context he analyzed documents having to do with the early years
   of Soviet rule and noticed that, ignoring their large quantity, the
   starting point of the development of the Soviet criminal law and the
   institution of complicity are the ``Guiding Principles of Criminal Law
   in the RSFSR{''} of December 12th, 1919. This document is then analyzed
   quite extensively. The law analyzes the institutional norms of joint
   criminal activity described in the Criminal Code of the RSFSR of 1922,
   the Criminal Code of the RSFSR of 1926, and other such documents that in
   one way or the next touch upon this topic, whether it is joint criminal
   activity in general or participation in criminal activity as part of an
   organized group.},

Title = {Public earthquake communication in Italy through a multi-source social
   media platform: The INGVterremoti experience (2010-2022)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {Communicating scientific information about earthquakes is an important
   and delicate issue in countries like Italy, where seismic risk is high.
   Furthermore, continuous and scientifically sound communication is
   needed, especially in recent times when social media have amplified the
   risk of being biased by misinformation, fake news and conspiracy
   theories. For this reason, we have developed a communication strategy
   for earthquake science and risk in Italy, mostly based on social media.
   The INGVterremoti platform was born between 2010 and 2012 with the goal
   of increasing scientific information released to the public, and also
   establishing a two-way communication channel between scientists and
   citizens. In the past 12 years, the INGVterremoti platform has gained
   trust and popularity, increasing the number of involved people, which
   amounts today to several hundred thousand. The platform consists of a
   coordinated suite of social media channels and a blog-magazine, where
   updates on ongoing earthquake sequences and posts on scientific topics
   are continuously published. Our end users are mostly citizens, but also
   authorities and media. Special attention has been given to interactions
   with the public, especially on our Facebook page, in order to understand
   their information needs, identify rumors and fake news, particularly in
   areas affected by seismic sequences, and address the most pressing
   requests. In this paper we describe the INGVterremoti strategy, the
   different media that we use, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses.
   We concentrate on the experience, carried out in the last few years, of
   the publication of provisional information on ongoing earthquakes, a
   long-standing issue strongly requested by our followers. The
   INGVterremoti platform has played a fundamental role in many seismic
   sequences of the past 12 years in Italy, starting from the Emilia
   sequence in 2012, to the central Italy one, started with the deadly
   earthquake of 24 August 2016 and still ongoing. Besides the periods of
   high attention after strong earthquakes, we used the INGVterremoti
   social media as a tool for releasing continuous and sound information to
   the public, and as a way to involve citizens in the communication arena.},

Title = {Correlates of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine Hesitancy
   Among People Who Inject Drugs in the San Diego-Tijuana Border Region},
Journal = {CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},

Pages = {E726-E733},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {Nearly one third of people injecting drugs in the US-Mexico border
   region were COVID-19 vaccine hesitant, which was significantly
   associated with exposure to social media, disinformation and
   co-morbidities and inversely associated with food security and high
   perceived COVID-19 threat.
   Background People who inject drugs (PWID) are vulnerable to acquiring
   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We
   examined correlates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine
   hesitancy among PWID in the US-Mexico border region, of whom only 7.6\%
   had received >= 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose by September 2021. Methods
   Between October 2020 and September 2021, participants aged >= 18 years
   from San Diego, California, USA, and Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico,
   who injected drugs within the last month completed surveys and
   SARS-CoV-2, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C virus
   (HCV) serologic testing. Logistic regressions with robust standard error
   estimation via generalized estimating equations identified factors
   associated with being unsure or unwilling to receive COVID-19 vaccines.
   Results Of 393 participants, 266 (67.7\%) were willing to receive
   COVID-19 vaccines and 127 (32.3\%) were hesitant (23.4\% unwilling and
   8.9\% unsure). Older participants, those with greater food insecurity,
   and those with greater concern about acquiring SARS-CoV-2 were more
   willing to be vaccinated. Higher numbers of chronic health conditions,
   having access to a smart phone or computer, and citing social media as
   one's most important source of COVID-19 information were independently
   associated with vaccine hesitancy. COVID-19-related disinformation was
   independently associated with vaccine hesitancy (adjusted odds ratio:
   1.51 per additional conspiracy theory endorsed; 95\% confidence
   interval: 1.31-1.74). Conclusions Nearly one third of people injecting
   drugs in the US-Mexico border region were COVID-19 vaccine hesitant,
   which was significantly associated with exposure to social media,
   disinformation and co-morbidities and inversely associated with food
   security and high perceived threat of COVID-19. Interventions that
   improve accurate knowledge of and trust in COVID-19 vaccines are needed
   in this vulnerable population.},

   LANGUAGE (linguo-geographic and semantic-etymological aspects)},
Journal = {EZHEGODNIK FINNO-UGORSKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-YEARBOOK OF FINNO-UGRIC STUDIES},

Abstract = {In recent years, the Vepsian language has been actively studied from the
   point of view of linguistic geography. Various problems of Vepsian
   linguistics and first of all of Vepsian vocabulary and semantics are
   presented in the method.
   This article is devoted to the consideration of speech verbs of the
   Vepsian language, their motivational and etymological analysis. From the
   point of view of semantics, the speech verbs of the Vepsian language are
   presented in the article in the following groups: speak for a rather
   long time while waiting for a possible answer (pagista, lodeita /
   lobaata, bast'a / basida); speak briefly, often without waiting for an
   answer (sanuda / sanda; virkta); speak in a higher tone without waiting
   for an answer (kirkta, heikta, varskahtada, kriknida); talk trifles,
   babble, chatter (vahtostada, vahtaita, bul'butada, buleita, parpatada,
   tototada, lollotada, tangotada, hablatada); speak, pronounce
   conspiracies, prayers (puhuda, puiteida, loita). Most of the Vepsian
   verbs of speech are Finnic heritage (pagista, sanuda, virkta, kirkta,
   bul'aita, tototada, lollotada), some are Vepsian innovations
   (vahtostada, vahtaita) or borrowings from the Russian language (bast'a,
   buodahvita), some are not yet amenable to etymologization (tangotada,
   hablatada). The motives for the emergence of the verbs of this semantics
   are, first of all, onomatopoeia (pagista `to speak' <hum, noise, sound
   of speech <a sound reminiscent of the noise of the wind; puhuda `to
   speak' <blow out words <blow out spells <blow out seeds from the mouth),
   and also metaphors (gurgling, splashing water, foam on the water - the
   basis for the emergence of verbs with the semantics of `chatting,
   babbling, talking nonsense': bul'butada, buleita, bul'uda, vahtostada,
   vahtaita) and folklore (sanuda, puiteida, loita). A feature of Vepsian
   speech verbs is their use in a pair that makes up the verbal binomial,
   which gives a special dynamics and expressiveness to the description of
   speaking (pagista papatada letters. `To talk + speak, to converse';
   lodeita loglotada letters. `To speak + to talk without stopping';
   pagista rapatada letters. `talk + pop incessantly', etc.).},

Title = {The fake first round about the Earth. The case of the supposed Chinese
   circumnavigation of 1421 from the post-truth paradigm},
Journal = {REVISTA LATINA DE COMUNICACION SOCIAL},

Pages = {950-968},
Abstract = {Introduction. 500 years ago, Magallanes undertook a trip that would end
   up being, in the hands of Juan Sebastian Elcano, the first round the
   world. But, surprising as it may seem, not everyone accepts this
   historical truth. Such is the case of the book 1421: The Year China
   Discovered the World, published with remarkable success in 2002, and
   with successive editions and translations. Its author, Gavin Menzies,
   constructs a story about this alternative fact: a Chinese expedition
   completed the first globe circumnavigation a century before the Spanish
   expedition. Methodology. A case study research of Menzies' book and its
   impact is proposed. To do this, we will start with the study question:
   How and why a false story around a historical event is nowadays
   constructed and disseminated? And how this fake history is counteracted?
   To do that, we will analyze multiple sources of evidence such as
   discourses and documentation in online environment. Results. The study
   underlines that the impact of the book starts right during the beginning
   of the so-called post-truth era, and it increases coinciding with these
   propitious moments for the propagation of fake news and fake history.
   Once analyzed the evidences, it is verified how historical alternative
   facts like these are created, transmitted, and maintained in time, and
   how commercials and also propagandistic interests can be behind of
   something like this. Conclusions. Not even the well-known first round to
   the world by Magallanes-Elcano is safe from the misinformation in the
   current era of post-truth. It is therefore important to remember once
   again the need to teach and spread historical truths in a rigorous, but
   also attractive and seductive way. At least as much as the fake history
   usually does. The disruptive stories of pseudohistory and conspiracy
   theories always will have a huge attraction for a part of the public, a
   public further increasing nowadays due to the digital ecosystem in which
   we live.},

   TRADERS</i>: THE CULMINATION OF THE SUPREME COURT'S EVOLUTION FROM
   LIBERAL TO REACTIONARY IN RULE 10B-5 ACTIONS},
Journal = {DENVER UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {91},

Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {``Political{''} decisions such as Citizens United and National
   Federation of Independent Business (Obamacare) reflect the reactionary
   bent of several Supreme Court Justices. But this reactionary trend is
   discernible in other areas as well. With regard to Rule 10b-5, the Court
   has handed down a series of decisions that could be grouped into four
   trilogies. The Article examines the trend over the past forty years
   which has become increasingly conservative and, finally, reactionary.
   The first trilogy was a liberal one, arguably overextending the scope of
   Rule 10b-5. This was followed by a conservative trilogy that put a brake
   on such extension, but did so in a jurisprudentially sound manner. The
   next trilogy, dealing with insider trading, regressed Rule 10b-5
   analysis back to a common law perspective. This was ironic since the
   securities laws were enacted because of the inadequacy of the common
   law.
   The final trilogy is unquestionably reactionary. Precedent is
   disregarded and the Court, in constraining the scope of Rule 10b-5,
   fails to hold accountable clearly wrongful conduct-such as conspiring to
   inflate a corporation's earnings or making false representations in
   prospectuses. In so doing, the Court characterizes a conspiracy to
   inflate the earnings of a corporation as an ``ordinary course
   transaction{''} taking place in the ``marketplace for goods and
   services{''} and adopts a definition of ``making{''} a statement that
   exculpates the person who drafted the statement and was the only person
   who knew the statement was false.
   Consequently, the conclusion asserts that the Court is less interested
   in protecting investors and more interested in constraining the scope of
   Rule 10b-5, and asserts the need for Congress to reinstate aiding and
   abetting liability in private securities fraud litigation. Such action
   by Congress will reverse not just Central Bank but also Stoneridge and
   Janus Capital, which supposedly were mandated by the Supreme Court's
   decision in Central Bank.},

Title = {Examining enablers of vaccine hesitancy toward routine childhood and
   adolescent vaccination in Malawi},
Journal = {GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCH AND POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},

Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Background The contribution of vaccination to global public health and
   community wellbeing has been described as one of the greatest success
   stories of modern medicine. However, 13.5 million children still miss at
   least one of their routine vaccinations, and this contributes to about
   1.5 million deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. One of the
   contributing factors has been associated with vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine
   hesitancy is the delay or refusal of vaccines despite their
   availability. The study explored factors from multiple perspectives that
   influence hesitancy among caregivers of children and adolescent girls
   eligible for childhood routine immunisation and the Human Papillomavirus
   vaccine in Malawi. Methods The methodology used was qualitative such as
   key informant interviews and focus-group discussion. Information was
   obtained from caregivers, community and religious leaders, leaders of
   civil society groups, teachers in schools where Human Papillomavirus
   vaccine were piloted, healthcare workers, national and district-level
   officials of the expanded program on immunisation. There were 25 key
   informant interviews and two focus-group discussions, with 13
   participants. The study was conducted between April to May 2020. The
   Interviews and discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and
   analysed using a thematic content approach. Results Most
   vaccine-hesitancy drivers for routine immunisation were also relevant
   for the HPV vaccine. The drivers included inadequate awareness of the
   vaccination schedule, rumours and conspiracy theories exacerbated by
   religious beliefs, low literacy levels of caregivers, distance and
   transport to the vaccination clinic, gender role and a disconnect
   between community healthcare workers and community leaders. Conclusions
   The study demonstrated that a network of factors determines vaccine
   hesitancy for childhood Routine Immunisation and Human Papillomavirus,
   and some of them are interrelated with one another. This has
   implications both for current levels of vaccine acceptance and the
   introduction of any new vaccine, such as those against Malaria,
   HIV/AIDS, HPV or COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Therefore,
   strategies developed to address vaccine hesitancy must be
   multi-component and wide-ranging.},

Title = {Public Discourse Against Masks in the COVID-19 Era: Infodemiology Study
   of Twitter Data},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Despite scientific evidence supporting the importance of
   wearing masks to curtail the spread of COVID-19, wearing masks has
   stirred up a significant debate particularly on social media.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate the topics associated with
   the public discourse against wearing masks in the United States. We also
   studied the relationship between the anti-mask discourse on social media
   and the number of new COVID-19 cases.
   Methods: We collected a total of 51,170 English tweets between January
   1, 2020, and October 27, 2020, by searching for hashtags against wearing
   masks. We used machine learning techniques to analyze the data
   collected. We investigated the relationship between the volume of tweets
   against mask-wearing and the daily volume of new COVID-19 cases using a
   Pearson correlation analysis between the two-time series.
   Results: The results and analysis showed that social media could help
   identify important insights related to wearing masks. The results of
   topic mining identified 10 categories or themes of user concerns
   dominated by (1) constitutional rights and freedom of choice; (2)
   conspiracy theory, population control, and big pharma; and (3) fake
   news, fake numbers, and fake pandemic. Altogether, these three
   categories represent almost 65\% of the volume of tweets against wearing
   masks. The relationship between the volume of tweets against wearing
   masks and newly reported COVID-19 cases depicted a strong correlation
   wherein the rise in the volume of negative tweets led the rise in the
   number of new cases by 9 days.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrated the potential of mining social
   media for understanding the public discourse about public health issues
   such as wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results
   emphasized the relationship between the discourse on social media and
   the potential impact on real events such as changing the course of the
   pandemic. Policy makers are advised to proactively address public
   perception and work on shaping this perception through raising
   awareness, debunking negative sentiments, and prioritizing early policy
   intervention toward the most prevalent topics.},

Abstract = {IntroductionVaccine hesitancy could undermine efforts to reduce
   incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Understanding COVID-19
   vaccine hesitancy is crucial to tailoring strategies to increase
   vaccination acceptance. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of
   and the reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Malang District,
   Indonesia. MethodsData come from a cross-sectional study among
   individuals aged 17-85 years old (N = 3,014). Multivariate ordered
   logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with
   postponing or refusing COVID-19 vaccines. The Oxford COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy scale was used to measure vaccine hesitancy. A wide range of
   reasons for hesitancy, including coronavirus vaccine confidence and
   complacency, vaccination knowledge, trust and attitude in health workers
   and health providers, coronavirus conspiracy, anger reaction and need
   for chaos, populist views, lifestyle, and religious influence, was
   examined. Results and discussionThe results show that 60.2\% of the
   respondents were hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Low
   confidence and complacency beliefs about the vaccine (OR = 1.229, 95\%
   CI = 1.195-1.264) and more general sources of mistrust within the
   community, particularly regarding health providers (OR = 1.064, 95\% CI
   = 1.026-1.102) and vaccine developers (OR = 1.054, 95\% CI =
   1.027-1.082), are associated with higher levels of COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy is also associated with anger reactions (OR
   = 1.019, 95\% CI = 0.998-1.040), need for chaos (OR = 1.044, 95\% CI =
   1.022-1.067), and populist views (OR = 1.028, 95\% CI = 1.00-1.056). The
   findings were adjusted for socio-demographic factors, including age,
   sex, education, marital status, working status, type of family,
   household income, religious beliefs, and residency. The results suggest
   the need for an effective health promotion program to improve community
   knowledge of the COVID-19 vaccine, while effective strategies to tackle
   ``infodemics{''} are needed to address hesitancy during a new vaccine
   introduction program.},

Title = {Public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines on English-language Twitter: A
   sentiment analysis},
Journal = {VACCINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {39},
Pages = {5499-5505},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Objective: To identify themes and temporal trends in the sentiment of
   COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets and to explore variations in sentiment
   at world national and United States state levels.
   Methods: We collected English-language tweets related to COVID-19
   vaccines posted between November 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. We
   applied the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner tool to
   calculate the compound score to determine whether the sentiment
   mentioned in each tweet was positive (compound >= 0.05), neutral (-0.05
   < compound < 0.05), or negative (compound <= -0.05). We applied the
   latent Dirichlet allocation analysis to extract main topics for tweets
   with positive and negative sentiment. Then we performed a temporal
   analysis to identify time trends and a geographic analysis to explore
   sentiment differences in tweets posted in different locations.
   Results: Out of a total of 2,678,372 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets,
   tweets with positive, neutral, and negative sentiments were 42.8\%,
   26.9\%, and 30.3\%, respectively. We identified five themes for positive
   sentiment tweets (trial results, administration, life, information, and
   efficacy) and five themes for negative sentiment tweets (trial results,
   conspiracy, trust, effectiveness, and administration). On November 9,
   2020, the sentiment score increased significantly (score = 0.234, p =
   0.001), then slowly decreased to a neutral sentiment in late December
   and was maintained until the end of January. At the country level,
   tweets posted in Brazil had the lowest sentiment score of -0.002, while
   tweets posted in the United Arab Emirates had the highest sentiment
   score of 0.162. The overall average sentiment score for the United
   States was 0.089, with Washington, DC having the highest sentiment score
   of 0.144 and Wyoming having the lowest sentiment score of 0.036.
   Conclusions: Public sentiment on COVID-19 vaccines varied significantly
   over time and geography. Sentiment analysis can provide timely insights
   into public sentiment toward the COVID-19 vaccine and guide public
   health policymakers in designing locally tailored vaccine education
   programs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Targeted social marketing of PrEP and the stigmatization of black sexual
   minority men},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 11},
Abstract = {Disparities in HIV incidence and PrEP uptake suggest a need to
   prioritize Black sexual minority men (SMM) in PrEP social marketing
   initiatives. However, images linking Black SMM to HIV and PrEP may
   inadvertently reinforce stigma. We examined HIV-negative/status-unknown
   Black SMM's responses to targeted PrEP advertisements using mixed
   methods, including an experiment embedded in a longitudinal online
   survey (Time 1: n = 96; Time 2 {[}eight weeks]: n = 73) and four focus
   groups (n = 18). The full factorial experiment included between-groups
   and within-subjects comparisons. For between-groups comparisons, each
   participant was randomly assigned to view one of 12 advertisements,
   which varied by couple composition (Black SMM couple/Black heterosexual
   couple/multiple diverse couples/no couples) and campaign (PrEPare for
   the Possibilities/PlaySure/PrEP4Love). We examined couple composition,
   campaign, and interaction effects on: advertisement judgments (Time 1),
   PrEP stigma (Time 1), PrEP motivation (Times 1 and 2), and PrEP behavior
   (Time 2). For within-subjects comparisons, each participant viewed all
   12 advertisements, and we examined couple composition, campaign, and
   interaction effects on advertisement judgments (Time 2). Focus group
   participants discussed advertising preferences and responded to the same
   set of advertisements. For between-groups and within-subjects
   comparisons, we found significant couple composition effects but no or
   limited campaign and interaction effects on advertisement judgments.
   Advertisements featuring Black SMM exclusively were judged as more
   stigmatizing than advertisements without couples. Advertisements with
   diverse (vs. no) couples were considered more eye-catching and
   motivating. There were minimal effects of couple composition and
   campaign on PrEP stigma, motivation, and behavior. Focus group
   participants corroborated concerns about the potential for PrEP
   advertisements to be stigmatizing, suggesting advertisements featuring
   Black SMM exclusively could be alienating and fuel conspiracy theories.
   Focus group participants generally favored diverse and less sexualized
   advertisements, particularly for public spaces. Findings collectively
   highlight the potential for targeted PrEP advertisements to stigmatize
   Black SMM and support diverse representation.},

Title = {New Insights Into the Social Rumor Characteristics During the COVID-19
   Pandemic in China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {BackgroundIn the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, several
   social rumors in the form of false news, conspiracy theories, and
   magical cures had ever been shared and spread among the general public
   at an alarming rate, causing public panic and increasing the complexity
   and difficulty of social management. Therefore, this study aims to
   reveal the characteristics and the driving factors of the social rumors
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsBased on a sample of 1,537 rumors
   collected from Sina Weibo's debunking account, this paper first divided
   the sample into four categories and calculated the risk level of all
   kinds of rumors. Then, time evolution analysis and correlation analysis
   were adopted to study the time evolution characteristics and the spatial
   and temporal correlation characteristics of the rumors, and the four
   stages of development were also divided according to the number of
   rumors. Besides, to extract the key driving factors from 15
   rumor-driving factors, the social network analysis method was used to
   investigate the driver-driver 1-mode network characteristics, the
   generation driver-rumor 2-mode network characteristics, and the
   spreading driver-rumor 2-mode characteristics. ResultsResearch findings
   showed that the number of rumors related to COVID-19 were gradually
   decreased as the outbreak was brought under control, which proved the
   importance of epidemic prevention and control to maintain social
   stability. Combining the number and risk perception levels of the four
   types of rumors, it could be concluded that the Creating Panic-type
   rumors were the most harmful to society. The results of rumor drivers
   indicated that panic psychology and the lag in releasing government
   information played an essential role in driving the generation and
   spread of rumors. The public's low scientific literacy and difficulty in
   discerning highly confusing rumors encouraged them to participate in
   spreading rumors. ConclusionThe study revealed the mechanism of rumors.
   In addition, studies involving rumors on different emergencies and
   social platforms are warranted to enrich the findings.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the role of WhatsApp in spreading misinformation
   during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. The aim of this
   study is to analyze the message content, format, authorship, time trends
   and social media distribution channels of misinformation in WhatsApp
   messages in Mexico. From March 18 to June 30, 2020 the authors collected
   all WhatsApp messages received via their personal contacts and their
   social networks that contained information about COVID-19. Descriptive
   and inferential statistics were used to analyze the scientifically
   inaccurate messages and the relationship between variables,
   respectively. Google image and video searches were carried out to
   identify sharing on other social media. Out of a total of 106 messages,
   the most frequently mentioned COVID-19 related message topics were
   prevention (20.0\%), conspiracy (18.5\%), therapy (15.4\%) and origin of
   the virus (10.3\%), changing throughout the pandemic according to users'
   concerns. Half of all WhatsApp messages were either images or videos.
   WhatsApp images were also shared on Facebook (80\%) and YouTube (similar
   to 50\%). Our findings indicate that the design of information and
   health promotion campaigns requires to be proactive in adapting to the
   changes in message content and format of misinformation shared through
   encrypted social media.
   Lay Summary As an encrypted social media platform with hardly accessible
   content, little is known about the role of WhatsApp in spreading
   misinformation messages (either false or misleading information) during
   the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. In this study, researchers studied the
   content, format, time and channel of distribution of WhatsApp messages
   containing information about COVID-19 collected via their personal
   contacts and their social networks from March 18 to June 30, 2020. Half
   of all messages were visually-appealing and the content changed
   according to the population ` s concerns. WhatsApp messages were also
   distributed in several other social media platforms. Understanding the
   format and content of misinformation may help to design dynamic health
   information and promotion campaigns against it. Regulations of public
   social media such as Youtube can have a positive impact on WhatsApp.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Canadian correctional institutions have been prioritized
   for COVID-19 vaccination given the multiple outbreaks that have occurred
   since the start of the pandemic. Given historically low vaccine uptake,
   we aimed to explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination
   acceptability among people incarcerated in federal prisons.\&
   nbsp;Methods: Three federal prisons in Quebec, Ontario, and British
   Columbia (Canada) were chosen based on previously low influenza vaccine
   uptake among those incarcerated. Using a qualitative design,
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with a diverse sample (gender,
   age, and ethnicity) of incarcerated people. An inductive-deductive
   analysis of audio-recorded interview transcripts was conducted to
   iden-tify and categorize barriers and facilitators within the
   Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF).\& nbsp;Results: From March 22-29,
   2021, a total of 15 participants (n = 5 per site; n = 5 women; median
   age = 43 years) were interviewed, including five First Nations people
   and six people from other minority groups. Eleven (73\%) expressed a
   desire to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, including two who previously
   refused influenza vaccination. We identified five thematic barriers
   across three TDF domains: social influ-ences (receiving strict
   recommendations, believing in conspiracies to harm), beliefs about
   consequences (believing that infection control measures will not be
   fully lifted, concerns with vaccine-related side effects), and knowledge
   (lack of vaccine-specific information), and eight thematic facilitators
   across five TDF domains: environmental context and resources (perceiving
   correctional employees as sources of out-breaks, perceiving challenges
   to prevention measures), social influences (receiving recommendations
   from trusted individuals), beliefs about consequences (seeking
   individual and collective protection, believing in a collective ``return
   to normal ``, believing in individual privileges), knowledge
   (reassurance about vaccine outcomes), and emotions (having experienced
   COVID-19-related stress).\& nbsp;Conclusions: Lack of information and
   misinformation were important barriers to COVID-19 vaccine acceptability
   among people incarcerated in Canadian federal prisons. This suggests
   that educational interventions, delivered by trusted health care
   providers, may improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake going forward.(C) 2022

Abstract = {Cataclysmic changes by the gradual spread of COVID-19 have triggered the
   interest of scientists, scholars, academicians, and linguists in
   analyzing the discourse related to the spread of the pandemic. The
   descriptions made by all of these scholars not only contribute to
   language with linguistic innovations but also cause the emergence of
   human attitudes and behaviours. At the same time, the issues raised
   through the language used during the challenging time of such crises
   shape and reveal several human schemas of language, discourse, society,
   and culture. Several studies on past situations of diseases and
   calamities have provided critical analyses of these schemas of difficult
   times in human history. Discourses through various linguistic practices
   in this regard play a crucial role in shaping and demonstrating the
   schemas of the crisis hit societies. Media discourse, specifically, has
   hidden powers to exercise, identify and report various socio-cultural
   issues. The current study focuses on finding the themes of
   socio-cultural attitudes and behaviours that emerged from newspaper
   editorials published in Pakistani newspapers in February, March and
   April, 2020. To achieve this goal, the corpus -driven analysis of 198
   newspaper editorials having 215,842 words was conducted. The study
   revealed various themes that prevailed in this pre-vaccination period of
   COVID-19 in Pakistan. The themes included the metaphoric use of the
   language such as battle, corps and frontline; racism while naming the
   virus as China virus or Hazara virus; conspiracy theories assumed to be
   associated with COVID-19 spread i.e. suspected involvement of Bill Gates
   and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), US and World Health
   Organization (WHO); negligence on the part of people; and criticism on
   government for health facilities and implications of globalization. It
   is concluded, based on these findings, that media representation of pre
   -vaccination phase of COVID-19 in Pakistan is loaded with unhealthy
   discourse which could have been avoided in order to shape positive
   attitudes and behaviours of the masses.},

Abstract = {Background: Within a few years, the global community has failed twice in
   responding to large viral infection outbreaks: the Ebola epidemic in
   2014 and the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in 2020. There is, however, no
   systematic approach or research available that analyses the repeated
   failures with regard to an adequate response to an epidemic. Methods:
   For a better understanding of failing societal responses, we have
   analysed the available research literature on societal responses to
   epidemics and we propose a framework called the `Epidemic Failure Cycle'
   (EFC). Results: The EFC consists of four phases: Negligence,
   Arrogance/Denial, Panic and Analysis/Self-criticism. These phases fit
   largely with the current World Health Organization pandemic influenza
   phases: Inter pandemic, Alert, Pandemic, Transition. By utilizing the
   Ebola epidemic and the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic as case studies, we show
   striking similarities in the response to these outbreaks during both
   crises. Finally, we suggest three major areas to be of utmost importance
   for triggering and maintaining the EFC. In terms of ecology, zoonoses,
   supposed to be the main biological origin for virus epidemics, have been
   largely neglected by politicians, the media and the scientific
   community. Socioeconomic and cultural conditions such as harsh living
   and working conditions as well as conspiracy theories hinder effective
   preventive and counter measures against epidemics. Lastly, in terms of
   epistemology, the reliance on knowledge about previous outbreaks has led
   to slow and inadequate decisions. Conclusions: We conclude that any
   current society has to be aware of the risks of repeating responses to
   epidemics that will fail. Being aware of the societal mechanisms that
   trigger inadequate responses may help to get to more appropriate
   decisions in the face of an epidemic. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published

Abstract = {Saggar's article is concerned with the use of evidence by the UK policy
   community to tackle Islamist-inspired terrorism. It focuses on how
   evidence for such terrorism is generated, interpreted and organized, in
   particular pinpointing the challenges of reliability and prediction
   facing those with responsibility for tackling terrorism and its
   associated causes. Counter-terrorism policy is heavily exposed to risks
   of bias and distortion, but it is also vulnerable to various kinds of
   institutional group-think and vested interests. This article scrutinizes
   three such aspects of counter-terrorism evidence-based policymaking.
   First, there are imperfections in the evidence base, mostly arising from
   data limitations and practical shortcomings. These include factual gaps
   in knowledge, difficulties in comparing evidence about Muslims with
   non-Muslims, methodological weaknesses and difficulties in measuring
   profoundly subjective feelings about alienation and grievance. Second,
   the scope of the problem to which policy is addressed (and the policy
   paradigms that are alluded to) shape the priorities placed on the
   evidence base. How much weight should be given to evidence about the
   narrative of oppression or dissent used by extremists? Background
   oppositional identities are extensively researched and yet policymakers
   may choose to concentrate instead on factors in the foreground that have
   to do with actual violent conspiracies. Third, important nuances in the
   evidence-policy nexus arise from the implicit generalizations that are
   held by policymakers. Evidence describing the problem of terrorism is
   better accompanied by an appreciation of (and perhaps evidence about)
   the behavioural situation of decision-makers and decision-making
   structures. This involves trade-offs, bargaining and accommodations to
   carry different constituencies, and has a bearing on the kind of
   evidence that is used in counter-terrorism. Saggar closes with a
   discussion of the above distinctions, and concludes that there is a risk
   of naivety in evidence-based policymaking that is not alive to the
   politics of radicalization and extremism.},

Title = {Decentralization Mislaid: On New Paternalism and Skepticism toward
   Experts},
Journal = {REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3-4, SI},
Pages = {361-387},
Abstract = {The goal of making people better off ``by their own standard{''} in the
   New Paternalism research program of Thaler-and-Sunstein-inspired
   ``nudging{''} raises a number of theoretical and practical risks. Some
   of these risks are straightforward. Others are subtle. I enumerate
   rarely acknowledged risks that nudging programs face based on
   informational loss, forgone individual payoffs, and social welfare
   losses. This essay draws on neoclassical information economics, social
   welfare theory, and the methodological literature on normative
   behavioral economics to focus on experts who propose policies based on
   New Paternalism and the apparently unforeseen social costs that their
   policies may impose.
   What is the socially optimal intensity of skepticism toward choice
   architects? Zero skepticism cannot be social-welfare maximizing insofar
   as voters' skepticism serves an important role in the political economy
   of disciplining political power. At the other extreme, maximal
   skepticism is unlikely to be social-welfare maximizing because it wastes
   good information that uninformed voters and politically appointed
   experts would both like to be transmitted and acted upon. Therefore, the
   socially optimal intensity of skepticism is a strictly interior value
   somewhere between zero and maximal.
   Because there is risk of other non-transparent objectives (e.g.,
   lobbying) influencing paternalistic choice architecture, one of its
   first-order effect is to increase skepticism. As policy makers impose
   increasingly aggressive policy experiments in choice architecture under
   the cover of social science (behavioral economics, in this case), the
   political economy shifts down a slippery slope along which individual
   response functions (e.g., updating of subjective beliefs) rationally
   select increasingly skeptical views of expert advice and government
   speech.
   Social costs from information loss and reduced coordination services
   (that would otherwise have been achieved by decentralization without
   choice architecture) suggest a more cautionary approach to policy and
   regulation. New Paternalism risks rationalizing increased skepticism
   which, in its limit, can rationalize conspiracy theories about shrouded
   objectives influencing choice architects.},

Abstract = {This article describes attempts in 1820 by a group of London-based
   conspirators to assassinate the British cabinet and print two
   proclamations declaring the establishment of a provisional government.
   One proclamation was addressed to the civilian population and the other
   to the rank and file of the military. It describes links between these
   conspirators, who were arrested in Cato Street on 23 February 1820, and
   a number of Irish radicals living in the metropolis who claimed to have
   been involved in the rebellions of 1798 and 1803. It suggests that the
   Cato Street proclamations were strongly influenced by John Sheares's
   proclamation of 1798, which had been intended to announce the success of
   the Irish rebellion.},

Journal = {PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION},

Abstract = {The antivax movement is now a constant phenomenon with increasing social
   implications. This study explores how the antivax movement is
   articulated in Romania on the basis of qualitative analysis applied to
   interviews. Our pilot study focuses on the opinions of 100 persons who
   oppose vaccination interviewed between 2017 and 2020. We conducted both
   face-to-face and online semistructured interviews to trace the factors
   determining attitudes against vaccination. To the best of the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first such extended study to target individuals
   rather than groups or media discourse. We strive to provide a
   multifaceted view on how the antivax phenomenon is taking shape.
   Responses varied in style and length, so we needed to systematize the
   narratives. We filtered the answers using the interpretive net described
   by Entman (1993), thereby grouping the main narratives into four
   sections. We then reconstructed the implicit frames used by individuals
   in interpreting their position. We consider content quality analysis to
   be a relevant method to reveal the facets and depth of the antivax
   phenomenon, thereby enabling more complex explanations. We compare the
   results of this study with rationales stemming from similar
   investigations conducted around the world and then highlight opinions
   specific to the Romanian public.},

Abstract = {This article explores a neglected, but important aspect of the
   misinformation challenge posed by some alternative media platforms in
   Aotearoa: namely, the spread of denialist or denialist-adjacent
   discourse on climate change, featuring messaging which aligns with the
   broad themes of medical misinformation and anti-vaccination propaganda
   seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we will demonstrate through a case
   study of Aotearoa New Zealand's 2021 `Groundswell' protests,
   locally-based influencers and `alt-media' platforms have disseminated
   conspiracist, unscientific narratives on both COVID and global warming
   to audiences likely to be receptive to these associations. The authors
   identify some of the tropes and narratives circulated by influencers
   during the demonstrations as bearing the fingerprints of radical
   right-wing discourse originating in the United States. The case is made
   that there is a high degree of cross-pollination of ideas at play within
   the phenomenon of anti-authority, conspiracist protest movements in
   Aotearoa, of which `Groundswell' was an instructive example (uniting
   rural protesters with anti-vaccine demagogues); the discourse is infused
   with emotionally potent falsehoods and American-style `culture wars'
   language. While these narratives remain relatively fringe, their toxic
   messaging may become more influential as more people turn to `alt-media'
   sources for news. Indeed, the extent to which some of the influencers
   and language from this movement are edging closer to the outer
   boundaries of mainstream media and politics may represent an early
   warning sign for the future trajectory of this phenomenon. Finally, the
   authors tentatively pose some recommendations for professional media
   engagement with the growth of `viral' content that misrepresents
   critical social challenges.},

Title = {Rumor Has It: The Adoption of Unverified Information in Conflict Zones},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {660-676},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Rumors run rite in areas affected by political instability and conflict.
   Their adoption plays a key role in igniting many forms of violence,
   including riots ethnic conflict, genocide, and war. While unverified at
   the time of transmission, some rumors are widely treated as truth, while
   others are dismissed as implausible or fake. What factors lead
   individuals to embrace rumors and other forms of unverified information?
   This article presents a new theoretical framework for understanding
   individual receptivity to rumors and tests it using original survey data
   gathered in insurgency-affected areas of Thailand and the Philippines.
   We find wide variation in rumor adoption, and argue that three factors
   drive individuals to embrace rumors: worldview, threat perception, and
   prior exposure. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find no evidence
   that commonly cited factors including education, income, age, and gender
   determine individual receptivity to rumors. We also explore the
   implications of belief in rumors on conflict dynamics. We find that
   greater receptivity to rumors correlates with the belief that ongoing
   conflict is intractable. This suggests that rumors can not only help
   spark political violence, but also impede its resolution. Our findings
   shed light on the complex interaction between worldview and unverified
   information in shaping popular beliefs and through them, political
   contention and competition in conflict areas and beyond.},

Abstract = {Aim. - Many Cameroonian sociocultures are between beliefs of a life
   after death or not. Nevertheless, after physical death, the separation
   that follows is always painful. This article discusses the theme of
   representations of child's death. It informs about the conception and
   the living of child's death of a cancer in Negroculture, and explains
   pre- and postmortem behaviours.
   Materials and methods. - During a 20-month anthropological survey
   conducted in the haematology-oncology department of the Mother and Child
   Centre of the Chantal-Biya foundation in Cameroon, a documentary search,
   semi-structured interviews with caregivers and 18 biographical
   interviews with families of children, most of them previously in
   remission, then admitted to palliative care (14 patients) or with
   desperate prognosis (four patients), and direct observations of
   near-death experiences and bereavement, have been performed. The data
   collected were analysed through the actantial scheme and interpreted
   under the conceptual prism of the euphemization of Pierre Bourdieu.
   Results. - Our results allowed us to realize that many families of
   children in remission cling to the obvious overweight of their children
   to skimp, and to resort to the hospital only in case of severe
   decrepitude. Then, even though the hospital does not have the explicit
   purpose of taking care of death, the families are reassured that their
   children are dying there in order to excuse themselves from any form of
   guilt or accusation. Finally, death imposes a latent domination as much
   on the caregivers as on the patients and their families. Because
   according to the well organized order of sociocultures in Cameroon,
   death is not just an episode of life, but a form of evil spirit that
   attaches to those who by evoking it, invoke it if they are not
   culturally able to cope, therefore there is a collective foreclosure. It
   is not a conspiracy of silence but an imitation of death's silence.
   Conclusion. - On the whole, this article advocates for the need to
   transfer the care of children in remission or not from a palliative
   emergency therapeutic culture to a preventive and systematic therapeutic
   culture care whether curative or palliative. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson

Title = {<i>Nanda-bangshochchhed</i> and <i>Hariraj</i>: Re-configuring Politics
   and the Private Mind in Two Bengali Adaptations of <i>Hamlet</i>},
Journal = {LITERATURE COMPASS},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {My essay will examine how two nineteenth-century Bengali adaptations of
   Hamlet negotiate the Shakespearean text and try to re-configure its
   approach towards politics and the private mind. The two Bengali plays in
   question are (i) Nanda-bangshochchhed ({''}The Destruction of the Nanda
   Dynasty{''}; published 1873) by Lakshminarayan Chakraborty, a text that
   was sparingly staged and is yet to gain adequate recognition as a case
   of Shakespearean appropriation; and (ii) Hariraj by Nagendranath
   Chaudhury (first staged in 1897), commercially the most successful
   adaptation of any Shakespeare play in the nineteenth-century Bengali
   theatre. The major point of departure for the first play is the question
   of political intrigue - which is to a large extent upstaged in the
   Shakespearean original by the focus on Hamlet's subjectivity. The first
   play curiously amalgamates the mythos of Hamlet with suggestions of a
   semi-legendary past, especially as derivable from the classical Sanskrit
   play Mudrarakshasa (4th-8th century CE). Accordingly, the
   Fortinbras-equivalent of the play is Nanda's half-brother Chandragupta
   (identifiable as the historical Chandragupta Maurya, 340-298BCE), and it
   has references to the historical figures of Rakshasa, Chanakya and even
   Alexander the Great. Similarly, the second play, which is set in a
   pseudo-historical Hindu state, greatly emphasizes elements of political
   and sexual conspiracy. It shows the Gertrude-equivalent as a Lady
   Macbeth-like figure who conspires with her lover to kill her husband,
   later plans against her son Hariraj, and commits suicide when the
   monstrosity of the crime dawns on her. Thus, the plays revise the
   dominant reading of Hamlet as a tragedy of deeply interiorized
   suffering, and alert one to the political catastrophe attendant upon the
   extinction of Hamlet's family line. These two Bengali adaptations choose
   to show the Hamlet-figure as subject to the contingencies of a communal
   existence, which are not always filtered through his consciousness.
   However, these two plays, which incidentally embody early attempts in
   Bengali at adapting the tragic to the received aesthetic repertoire of
   India, also evoke at key moments Hamlet's celebrated contemplativeness
   and engage on indigenous terms with a Western model of staging
   interiority.},

Title = {Sociodemographic and Behavioral Predictors of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy
   in Pakistan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {2847-2856},
Abstract = {Background: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
   continues with resurgent second and third waves worldwide. Vaccination
   is one of several measures that are needed to end this pervasive threat.
   Pakistan, however, has a relatively low rate of routine vaccine
   acceptance. Our study aimed to determine the proportion and predictors
   of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH) among adults in Pakistan.
   Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted from December 27,
   2020 to March 6, 2021. Non-probability sampling was applied to recruit
   study participants through social media platforms (ie, Facebook and
   Twitter) and through free messaging services (WhatsApp). Stata 16 was
   used to generate descriptive statistics and logistic regression models
   for identifying predictive variables of vaccine hesitancy. A p-value of
   <0.05 was considered strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
   Results: Out of 1014 participants, 35.8\% (n=363) were hesitant about
   receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for VH included concerns about
   side effects (42.4\%), belief in conspiracy theories (20.1\%), perceived
   inefficacy of the vaccine (13.2\%), and perceived protection through
   precautionary measures (12.6\%). Urban residency (AOR 2.34, 95\% CI
   1.54-3.57), reservations about vaccine safety (AOR 3.29, 95\% CI
   1.68-6.44), uncertainty about vaccine efficacy (AOR 2.70, 95\% CI
   1.50-4.86), failure of the vaccine to reduce hospitalization and death
   (AOR 6.36, 95\% CI 4.01-10.22), and unfelt need for vaccination
   awareness among public (AOR 2.02, 95\% CI 1.28-3.14) were associated
   with higher rates of VH. At least one chronic disease (AOR 0.60, 95\% CI
   0.39-0.92), knowing someone infected with COVID-19 (AOR 0.56, 95\% CI
   0.39-0.81), and trusting information from the ministry of health (AOR
   0.64, 95\% CI 0.41-0.99) and physicians (AOR 0.27, 95\% CI 0.13-0.53)
   were found to be associated with lower rates of COVID-19 VH.
   Conclusion: More than one third of survey participants were VH. COVID-19
   vaccine uptake in Pakistan can be improved through targeted health
   education strategies and planned interventions that address the barriers
   identified in the present study.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study is to analyze the German-Soviet front line crossing
   by the OUN and UIA underground in 1943-1944. To show the dynamics of the
   process in relation to the offensive operations lead by the Red Army.
   The methodology of the study consists of a combination of scientific
   principles, general scientific and special historical methods. The
   scientific novelty of the study is based on the complex research and
   demonstration of the features of the front tine crossing by the OUN and
   UIA underground in different regions of Ukraine. The stated issue was
   first raised and subjectively covered in Ukrainian and foreign
   historiography. The prospects for further research at the level of
   individual territories are defined. Conclusions. It is defined that the
   subdivisions of the OUN of Eastern, Northeastern, Central and Southern
   Ukraine were able to evacuate a large part of their personnel. Many of
   those individuals were joined the UIA units. The most prepared ones and
   able to carry out independent work were left in the rear of the Red
   Army. The Transnistrian OUN underground established the negotiation with
   Romanians as the military front approached. Simultaneously the
   negotiations with the Hungarian and Lithuanian units took place in
   Volyn. The preparation of the OUN and UIA to cross the front line had
   gained special significance in Western Ukraine. The large-scale of
   preparations was done to provide the facilities, increase conspiracy
   measures, liquidate the enemy agency, to make a large number of
   agitation leaflets for the Red Army. During the war period, the OUN
   network remained largely in place, pretending to be local peasants,
   refugees, or remained unseen in the underground hiding places. The UIA
   units tried to avoid clashes with the front units by moving away from
   the combat operations, maneuvering and hiding in hard-to-reach areas, or
   splitting into small groups. The delay of the front line in the Volyn
   region in the ``Tury{''} military district resulted in the biggest
   losses. Nevertheless, in general, the underground managed to
   successfully move to the rear of the Red Army. The total number of the
   killed OUN and UIA members in Ukraine did not exceed 12\%.},

Title = {Documents on Freemasonry from the Archive of Archimandrite Photius
   (Spassky)},
Journal = {HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST},
Year = {2020},
Number = {3},
Pages = {676-691},
Abstract = {The article introduces into scientific use an analytical note on
   Freemasonry addressed to Alexander I. In Europe in the 18th - 19th
   centuries, there was extensive anti-Masonic literature. In Russia, such
   works were rare. Reputedly, the greatest Russian extirpator of
   Freemasonry was Archimandrite Photius (Spassky). The ban of Masonic
   lodges in 1822 is attributed to his influence on Alexander I. Photius
   was one of the leaders of the social movement of the Russian Orthodox
   opposition. Among other objects of its criticism were the Masonic
   lodges. However, a consolidated anti-Masonic action failed to
   materialize. Now it has been made possible to explain the opposition's
   restraint in its attitude to Freemasonry. Four volumes of documents
   belonging to archimandrite Photius have been found in the Russian State
   Historical Archive. These are the materials from 1817-32. The collection
   includes personal documents of Photius, messages and letters of
   Metropolitan Seraphim (Glagolevsky), A. A. Arakcheev, A.S. Shishkov,
   Metropolitan Filaret (Drozdov). Many of these documents were handed over
   to Emperor Alexander I and influenced his change of heart in the
   politics. An anonymous note on Freemasonry from the Photius collection
   is included in the article in its entirety as a rare example of an
   anti-Masonic message to the Emperor. The note gives a retrospective of
   the Masonic movement in Russia. It describes what influence the masons
   of the 18th century had on Freemasonry of the 19th century. Most
   mentioned Masonic leaders belonged to the ``Rosicrucian{''} system of
   Freemasonry (Order of the Golden and Pink Cross). The author of the note
   assured the emperor that there were Rosicrucians in his inner circle. He
   named Senator I. V. Lopukhin, publisher and translator A. F. Labzin, R.
   A. Koshelev, and the tsar's friend, Minister A. N. Golitsyn. Photius's
   documents show that criticism of Freemasonry was not the focus of the
   Russian Orthodox opposition activities. Among the opposition there were
   people who shared the idea of a worldwide Masonic conspiracy: S. I.
   Smirnov, M. L. Magnitsky. In Archimandrite Photius's documents
   references to Freemasonry are very rare. At the time of the opposition's
   action in 1824, the issue of Freemasonry was no longer relevant, since
   Freemasonry was subjected to a government ban in 1822.},

Title = {A Humanist's Pontifical Playground Pius II and Transylvania in the Days
   of <i>John Dragula</i>},
Journal = {TRANSYLVANIAN REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {35-70},
Abstract = {One of the political letters deemed worthy to be cited and copied by
   Pope Pius II (dim Enea Silvio Piccolomini) in his Commentaries was the
   message allegedly sent by Vlad III the Impaler (Dracula), voivode of
   Wallachia, to Sultan Mehmed II on 7 November 1462. The missive was the
   textual embryo of Book XI, chapter 12 (Iohannis Dragule immanis atque
   nefancla crudditas, eiusque in regem Hungarie deprehensa peifidia, et
   tandem captivitas), covering over a fifth of the chapter. The Dragula
   chapter was placed between the depiction (in chapter 11) of the Viennese
   conspiracy against Albert VI of Habsburg, the rival brother of Emperor
   Frederick III of Habsburg (April 1462), and the emphatic presentation
   (in chapter 13) of the royal anti-Ottoman request sent by Stephen
   Tomagevic, the new king of Bosnia, to Pius II (roughly a year earlier,
   in the late summer of 1461, a date the pope nevertheless failed to
   mention, though he extensively quoted both the oration of TomageviC's
   envoys and the subsequent papal response). The case ofJohn Dragula
   explicitly linked chapters 11 and 13. Frequently overlooked, the
   chapters that frame the account of the infamous deeds of the voivode of
   Wallachia outline its logical political context, founded on Matthias
   Corvinus. The son of John Hunyadi, who had executed John Dragula's
   father, Vlad II Dracul (just Dragula, according to the pope), was (as
   recorded also by Pius II): (1) the overlord (i.e. su7Prain) ofJohn
   Dragula, (2) the archrival of Frederick III, and (3) the challenged
   suzerain of Stephen TomageviC. Prior to the Dragula issue of 1462, Pius
   II had loyally served Frederick as his secretary and envoy (from late
   1442 until he was elected pope in August 1458) and had sent a crown for
   Stephen Tomagevies royal coronation on Christmas Day 1461 (against the
   opposition of Matthias, whose Bosnian rights Pius II nevertheless
   claimed, in his Commentaries, to have defended). Based on the case
   ofJohn Dragula, the most famous Wallachian in Enea's/Pius' writings, the
   study focuses on the actual case at hand: that of the humanist/pope and
   his designs for a continent and a faith in turmoil.},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs the strange vicissitudes of Alessandro Amidei,
   a Florentine possibly Jewish, who moved to England in 1656. It seems
   that he taught Hebrew at Oxford and Cambridge in the 1650s, while it is
   certain that he was professor of the same language in Edinburgh in the
   1670s. A singular figure with a shifting and elusive identity, on his
   arrival in England Amidei presented himself to the Coetus of the foreign
   London churches as a Catholic ecclesiastic converted to Protestantism.
   However, in the following years he professed to be a Jew converted to
   Christianity. We do not have enough elements to establish the truth. In
   1684 he was involved in what seemed to be a case of attempted murder at
   the damage of the sons of Barbara Palmer, Duchess of Cleveland, the
   attack being planned by her lover at the time, some actor of dubious
   morality. The Duchess' sons accused Amidei of having poisoned their
   wine, although this presumed conspiracy was probably their own
   invention, a strategy to Put an end to the union between their mother
   and a most embarrassing lover. The actor was released because of
   unsubstantial charges. In spite of the reputation he gained in the
   affair, in the following years Amidei - a character of endless resources
   - maintained relations with the English intellectual milieu. In the
   1690s he was again in Cambridge, where he wrote at least two letters in
   Italian to John Covel, prominent vice-chancellor of the University
   Amidei is also the author of an unpublished Italian translation of the
   Book of Common Prayer dated 1661. Amidei's story is interesting for
   various reasons. First of all, and whatever his real religious identity,
   his case shows how in the philosemite England of those years he found it
   more convenient to present himself as a Jew rather than a converted from
   Catholicism. His story is also paradigmatic of the bizarre world of
   destitute wretches, often unfrocked friars and priests, who moved around
   the Italian protestant church of London passing from one confession to
   the other in search of some form of financial support.},

Abstract = {The problem of media reflection on social and cultural recognition has
   resonated in theoretical and practical discourse for decades; however,
   nowadays it is becoming even more important and literally urgent. On the
   other hand, we are confronted with media coverage related to
   international terrorism and, moreover, with subsequent feeling of fear
   and imminent threat. The media still continue in their long-term neglect
   of the issues associated with global hunger and poverty in so-called
   developing countries, in which violent attacks and outbreaks happen on a
   daily basis. In Africa and Asia, this struggle is about economic and
   social survival. The resistance against injustice (or rather
   misrecognition) is expressed by social groups as well as individuals,
   mostly in terms of their experience with violation of the expected
   recognition. Misrecognition is therefore transformed into a motivational
   force that functions as a basis for the resistance and critique.
   Information dissemination is, taking into consideration the current
   trends in global communication, closely connected to the existence of
   multi-national media conglomerates. These can be seen as key actors
   influencing the global system of communication. Large media companies
   may operate on a global scale, but their headquarters are still located
   in North America, Europe, Australia, Japan, or on the other, side., in
   Russian Federation, China, Qatar. The concentration of media ownership
   results in increased selectivity applied to information processing
   -certain pieces of news often cannot be verified due to their nature
   and/or significant geographical and cultural distance from their places
   of origin. Web sites, weblogs or print and online magazines, which focus
   on spreading conspiracies, are often the only alternative to the widely
   absent media coverage and, as a result, they intoxicate this system by
   unverified information and half-truths. The aim of the study is to place
   emphasis on the long-ignored problems which escalate in the form of
   violent attacks -however, the fundamental and so-farunresolved issue
   here is the much needed social change. The media should be able to
   normatively assume responsibility for informing about the current
   affairs happening in areas stricken by international conflicts.},

Title = {Does mass drug administration for the integrated treatment of neglected
   tropical diseases really work? Assessing evidence for the control of
   schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths in Uganda},
Journal = {HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {Background: Less is known about mass drug administration {[}MDA] for
   neglected tropical diseases {[}NTDs] than is suggested by those so
   vigorously promoting expansion of the approach. This paper fills an
   important gap: it draws upon local level research to examine the roll
   out of treatment for two NTDs, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted
   helminths, in Uganda.
   Methods: Ethnographic research was undertaken over a period of four
   years between 2005-2009 in north-west and south-east Uganda. In addition
   to participant observation, survey data recording self-reported take-up
   of drugs for schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminths and, where
   relevant, lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis was collected from a
   random sample of at least 10\% of households at study locations. Data
   recording the take-up of drugs in Ministry of Health registers for NTDs
   were analysed in the light of these ethnographic and social survey data.
   Results: The comparative analysis of the take-up of drugs among adults
   revealed that although most long term residents have been offered
   treatment at least once since 2004, the actual take up of drugs for
   schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths varies considerably from
   one district to another and often also within districts. The specific
   reasons why MDA succeeds in some locations and falters in others relates
   to local dynamics. Issues such as population movement across borders,
   changing food supply, relations between drug distributors and targeted
   groups, rumours and conspiracy theories about the `real' purpose of
   treatment, subjective experiences of side effects from treatment,
   alternative understandings of affliction, responses to social control
   measures and historical experiences of public health control measures,
   can all make a huge difference. The paper highlights the need to adapt
   MDA to local circumstances. It also points to specific generalisable
   issues, notably with respect to health education, drug distribution and
   more effective use of existing public health legislation.
   Conclusion: While it has been an achievement to have offered free drugs
   to so many adults, current standard practices of monitoring, evaluation
   and delivery of MDA for NTDs are inconsistent and inadequate. Efforts to
   integrate programmes have exacerbated the difficulties. Improved
   assessment of what is really happening on the ground will be an
   essential step in achieving long-term overall reduction of the NTD
   burden for impoverished communities.},

Title = {TDCOSMO: I. An exploration of systematic uncertainties in the inference
   of <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> from time-delay cosmography},
Journal = {ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {639},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Time-delay cosmography of lensed quasars has achieved 2.4\% precision on
   the measurement of the Hubble constant, H-0. As part of an ongoing
   effort to uncover and control systematic uncertainties, we investigate
   three potential sources: 1- stellar kinematics, 2- line-of-sight
   effects, and 3- the deflector mass model. To meet this goal in a
   quantitative way, we reproduced the H0LiCOW/SHARP/STRIDES (hereafter
   TDCOSMO) procedures on a set of real and simulated data, and we find the
   following. First, stellar kinematics cannot be a dominant source of
   error or bias since we find that a systematic change of 10\% of measured
   velocity dispersion leads to only a 0.7\% shift on H-0 from the seven
   lenses analyzed by TDCOSMO. Second, we find no bias to arise from
   incorrect estimation of the line-of-sight effects. Third, we show that
   elliptical composite (stars + dark matter halo), power-law, and cored
   power-law mass profiles have the flexibility to yield a broad range in
   H-0 values. However, the TDCOSMO procedures that model the data with
   both composite and power-law mass profiles are informative. If the
   models agree, as we observe in real systems owing to the
   ``bulge-halo{''} conspiracy, H-0 is recovered precisely and accurately
   by both models. If the two models disagree, as in the case of some
   pathological models illustrated here, the TDCOSMO procedure either
   discriminates between them through the goodness of fit, or it accounts
   for the discrepancy in the final error bars provided by the analysis.
   This conclusion is consistent with a reanalysis of six of the TDCOSMO
   (real) lenses: the composite model yields
   H-0 = 74.0(-1.8)(+1.7) km s(-1) Mpc(-1)
   H 0
   = 74 .

   - 1.8

   2
   - 1.6
   + 1.6

   . In conclusion, we find no evidence of bias or errors larger than the

Title = {Deciphering the radio-star formation correlation on kpc scales II. The
   integrated infrared-radio continuum and star formation-radio continuum
   correlations},

Abstract = {Given the multiple energy-loss mechanisms of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons
   in galaxies, the tightness of the infrared (IR)-radio continuum
   correlation is surprising. As the radio continuum emission at GHz
   frequencies is optically thin, this offers the opportunity to obtain
   unbiased star formation rates (SFRs) from radio-continuum flux-density
   measurements. The calorimeter theory can naturally explain the tightness
   of the far-infrared (FIR)-radio correlation but makes predictions that
   do not agree with observations. Noncalorimeter models often have to
   involve a conspiracy to maintain the tightness of the FIR-radio
   correlation. We extended a published analytical model of galactic disks
   by including a simplified prescription for the synchrotron emissivity.
   The galactic gas disks of local spiral galaxies, low-z starburst
   galaxies, high-z main sequence star-forming galaxies, and high-z
   starburst galaxies are treated as turbulent clumpy accretion disks. The
   magnetic field strength is determined by the equipartition between the
   turbulent kinetic and the magnetic energy densities. Our fiducial model,
   which includes neither galactic winds nor CR electron secondaries,
   reproduces the observed radio continuum spectral energy distributions of
   most (similar to 70\%) of the galaxies. Except for the local spiral
   galaxies, fast galactic winds can potentially make the conflicting
   models agree with observations. The observed IR-radio correlations are
   reproduced by the model within 2 sigma of the joint uncertainty of model
   and data for all datasets. The model agrees with the observed SFR-radio
   correlations within similar to 4 sigma. Energy equipartition between the
   CR particles and the magnetic field only approximately holds in our
   models of main sequence star-forming galaxies. If a CR electron
   calorimeter is assumed, the slope of the IR-radio correlation flattens
   significantly. Inverse Compton losses are not dominant in the starburst
   galaxies because in these galaxies not only the gas density but also the
   turbulent velocity dispersion is higher than in normal star-forming
   galaxies. Equipartition between the turbulent kinetic and magnetic field
   energy densities then leads to very high magnetic field strengths and
   very short synchrotron timescales. The exponents of our model SFR-radio
   correlations at 150 MHz and 1.4 GHz are very close to one.},

Title = {Extended Goal Recognition: Lessons from Magic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {The ``science of magic{''} has lately emerged as a new field of study,
   providing valuable insights into the nature of human perception and
   cognition. While most of us think of magic as being all about deception
   and perceptual ``tricks{''}, the craft-as documented by psychologists
   and professional magicians-provides a rare practical demonstration and
   understanding of goal recognition. For the purposes of human-aware
   planning, goal recognition involves predicting what a human observer is
   most likely to understand from a sequence of actions. Magicians perform
   sequences of actions with keen awareness of what an audience will
   understand from them and-in order to subvert it-the ability to predict
   precisely what an observer's expectation is most likely to be. Magicians
   can do this without needing to know any personal details about their
   audience and without making any significant modification to their
   routine from one performance to the next. That is, the actions they
   perform are reliably interpreted by any human observer in such a way
   that particular (albeit erroneous) goals are predicted every time. This
   is achievable because people's perception, cognition and sense-making
   are predictably fallible. Moreover, in the context of magic, the
   principles underlying human fallibility are not only well-articulated
   but empirically proven. In recent work we demonstrated how aspects of
   human cognition could be incorporated into a standard model of goal
   recognition, showing that-even though phenomena may be ``fully
   observable{''} in that nothing prevents them from being observed-not all
   are noticed, not all are encoded or remembered, and few are remembered
   indefinitely. In the current article, we revisit those findings from a
   different angle. We first explore established principles from the
   science of magic, then recontextualise and build on our model of
   extended goal recognition in the context of those principles. While our
   extensions relate primarily to observations, this work extends and
   explains the definitions, showing how incidental (and apparently
   incidental) behaviours may significantly influence human memory and
   belief. We conclude by discussing additional ways in which magic can
   inform models of goal recognition and the light that this sheds on the
   persistence of conspiracy theories in the face of compelling
   contradictory evidence.},

Title = {Predictors of eHealth Literacy and Its Associations with Preventive
   Behaviors, Fear of COVID-19, Anxiety, and Depression among Undergraduate
   Nursing Students: A Cross-Sectional Survey},

Abstract = {Background: The infodemic has been co-existing with the COVID-19
   pandemic with an influx of misinformation and conspiracy theories. These
   affect people's psychological health and adherence to preventive
   measures. eHealth literacy (eHEALS) may help with alleviating the
   negative effects of the infodemic. As nursing students are future
   healthcare professionals, having adequate eHEALS skills is critically
   important in their clinical practice, safety, and health. This study
   aimed to (1) explore the eHEALS level and its associated factors, and
   (2) examine the associations of eHEALS with preventive behaviors, fear
   of COVID-19 (FCV-19S), anxiety, and depression among nursing students.
   Methods: We surveyed 1851 nursing students from 7 April to 31 May 2020
   from eight universities across Vietnam. Data were collected, including
   demographic characteristics, eHEALS, adherence to preventive behaviors
   (handwashing, mask-wearing, physical distancing), FCV-19S, anxiety, and
   depression. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed
   appropriately to examine associations. Results: The mean score of eHEALS
   was 31.4 +/- 4.4. The eHEALS score was significantly higher in males
   (unstandardized regression coefficient, B, 0.94; 95\% confidence
   interval, 95\% CI, 0.15 to 1.73; p = 0.019), and students with a better
   ability to pay for medication (B, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.39 to 1.19; p <
   0.001), as compared to their counterparts. Nursing students with a
   higher eHEALS score had a higher likelihood of adhering to hand-washing
   (odds ratio, OR, 1.18; 95\% CI, 1.15 to 1.22; p < 0.001), mask-wearing
   (OR, 1.15; 95\% CI, 1.12 to 1.19; p < 0.001), keeping a safe physical
   distance (OR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.15 to 1.25; p < 0.001), and had a lower
   anxiety likelihood (OR, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.92 to 0.99; p = 0.011).
   Conclusions: Nursing students who were men and with better ability to
   pay for medication had higher eHEALS scores. Those with higher eHEALS
   scores had better adherence to preventive measures, and better
   psychological health. The development of strategies to improve eHEALS of
   nursing students may contribute to COVID-19 containment and improve
   their psychological health.},

Abstract = {KEMAL CICEK: The Power of Rumours in the Making of History: The Case of
   the Adana Incident of 1909 in the Ottoman Empire (pp. 951-972) The Adana
   Incident of 1909 is one of the local events of the Armeno-Muslim
   relations during the final decades of the history of the Ottoman Empire.
   A good amount of works has been hitherto done by the historians of the
   Middle Fast about the communal conflict in Adana in April 1909.
   Historians have so far heavily focused on the political, economic and
   social dimensions and/or reasons of the conflict. In spite of the
   proliferation of writings, however, very few have touched upon the power
   of rumours in the escalation of violence between the two communities.
   Indeed, my work on the archival sources of the incident have produced
   enormous documentation which indicate that the rumours circulated around
   the city had played unquestionable role in building distrust between the
   peoples and led to the rise of numerous conspiracy theories. According
   to one rumour the Armenians were organizing themselves against the
   Muslims in order to separate from the Empire. Another rumour was that a
   group of Armenian rebels were about to attack Muslim villages around the
   city, which stirred up the fears of Muslims. There were also rumours
   circulating among the Muslim community that Armenians had dug up an
   underground tunnel in order to reach the weapons depot, which was to aid
   them in their quest for independence. One major rumour was that
   Armenians placed human faeces at the door of the Great Mosque. Indeed it
   was through such rumours that suspicions were piqued and people sought
   to acquire weapons as a means of protecting themselves. Thus when the
   killings began on April 14, 1909 in Adana, people attacked each other
   under the influence of the psychology built by such rumours.
   Therefore I am of the opinion that it is important to deal with rumour
   and its affinity to communal violence in history. In this paper an
   attempt will be made to analyse the role of rumours in the events that
   unfolded in Adana in April 1909.},

Abstract = {It has been over a hundred years since George Bernard Shaw wrote that
   ``{[}a]ll professions are a conspiracy against the laity.{''} Since
   then, the number of occupations and the percentage of workers subject to
   occupational licensing have exploded; nearly one-third of the US.
   workforce is now licensed, up from five percent in the 1950s. Through
   occupational licensing boards, states endow cosmetologists, veterinary
   doctors, medical doctors, and florists with the authority to decide who
   may practice their art. It cannot surprise when licensing boards
   comprised of competitors regulate in ways designed to raise their
   profits. The result for consumers is higher prices and less choice, as
   licensing raises wages by eighteen percent and bars competition from
   unlicensed workers. For African-style hair bra iders, the result is
   either an illicit business or thousands of hours of irrelevant training
   imposed by a cosmetology board. For lawyers, the result is less
   competition from tax accountants, paralegals, and out-of-state lawyers.
   The Sherman Act's great accomplishment has been to make cartels per se
   illegal and relatively scarce unless the cartel is managed by a
   professional licensing board. Most jurisdictions consider such boards,
   as state creations, exempt from antitrust scrutiny by the state action
   doctrine, leaving would-be competitors and consumers no recourse against
   their cartel-like activity.
   We contend that the state action doctrine should not prevent antitrust
   suits against state licensing boards that are comprised of private
   competitors deputized to regulate and to outright exclude their own
   competition, often with the threat of criminal sanction. At most, state
   action should immunize licensing boards from the per se rule and require
   plaintiffs to prove their cases under the rule of reason. We argue that
   the Fourth Circuit's recent decision, soon to be reviewed by the Supreme
   Court, to uphold a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) antitrust suit against
   a licensing board denying state action immunity to a licensing board and
   thereby creating a circuit split was a step in the right direction but
   did not go far enough. The Supreme Court should take the split as an
   opportunity to clarify that when competitors hold the reins to their own
   competition, they must answer to Senator Sherman.},

Abstract = {We review a recent analysis presented in arXiv:1304.7813 {[}hep-phys]
   and 1305.6652 {[}hep-phys]. After the discovery of the Higgs the most
   relevant structures of the SM have been verified and for the first time
   we know all parameters of the SM within remarkable accuracy. Together
   with recent calculations of the SM renormalization group coefficients up
   to three loops we can safely extrapolate running couplings high up in
   energy. Assuming that the SM is a low energy effective theory of a
   cutoff theory residing at the Planck scale, we are able to calculate the
   effective bare parameters of the underlying cutoff system. For my
   specific set of MS input parameters, it turns out that the bare mass
   term changes sign not far below the Planck scale, which means that in
   the early universe the SM was in the symmetric phase. The sign-flip,
   which is a result of a conspiracy between the SM couplings and their
   screening/antiscreening behavior, triggers the Higgs mechanism. Above
   the Higgs phase transition the bare mass term in the Higgs potential
   must have had a large positive value, enhanced by the quadratic
   divergence of the bare Higgs mass. The Higgs mass term thus provides the
   large dark energy density in the early universe, which triggers Gaussian
   slow-roll inflation, i.e. the SM Higgs is the inflaton scalar field.
   Reheating is dominated by the decay of the heavy Higgses into ( in the
   symmetric phase) massless top/anti-top quark pairs. The Higgs mechanism
   stops inflation and the subsequent electroweak phase transition provides
   the masses to the SM particles in proportion to their coupling strength.
   The previously most abundantly produced particles are now the heaviest
   and decay into the lighter ones, by cascading down the
   Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)-matrix from top and bottom to normal
   matter. Baryon-number B violating interactions are naturally provided by
   Weinberg's set of close-by dimension 6 four-fermion effective
   interactions. Since matter is produced originating in the primordial
   heavy Higgs fields via C-and CP-violating decays we have actually a new
   scenario which could explain the baryon-asymmetry essentially in terms
   of SM physics.},

Title = {Tweet Topics and Sentiments Relating to COVID-19 Vaccination Among
   Australian Twitter Users: Machine Learning Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {Background: COVID-19 is one of the greatest threats to human beings in
   terms of health care, economy, and society in recent history. Up to this
   moment, there have been no signs of remission, and there is no proven
   effective cure. Vaccination is the primary biomedical preventive measure
   against the novel coronavirus. However, public bias or sentiments, as
   reflected on social media, may have a significant impact on the
   progression toward achieving herd immunity.
   Objective: This study aimed to use machine learning methods to extract
   topics and sentiments relating to COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter.
   Methods: We collected 31,100 English tweets containing COVID-19
   vaccine-related keywords between January and October 2020 from
   Australian Twitter users. Specifically, we analyzed tweets by
   visualizing high-frequency word clouds and correlations between word
   tokens. We built a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to
   identify commonly discussed topics in a large sample of tweets. We also
   performed sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiments and
   emotions related to COVID-19 vaccination in Australia.
   Results: Our analysis identified 3 LDA topics: (1) attitudes toward
   COVID-19 and its vaccination, (2) advocating infection control measures
   against COVID-19, and (3) misconceptions and complaints about COVID-19
   control. Nearly two-thirds of the sentiments of all tweets expressed a
   positive public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine; around one-third
   were negative. Among the 8 basic emotions, trust and anticipation were
   the two prominent positive emotions observed in the tweets, while fear
   was the top negative emotion.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that some Twitter users in Australia
   supported infection control measures against COVID-19 and refuted
   misinformation. However, those who underestimated the risks and severity
   of COVID-19 may have rationalized their position on COVID-19 vaccination
   with conspiracy theories. We also noticed that the level of positive
   sentiment among the public may not be sufficient to increase vaccination
   coverage to a level high enough to achieve vaccination-induced herd
   immunity. Governments should explore public opinion and sentiments
   toward COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination, and implement an effective
   vaccination promotion scheme in addition to supporting the development
   and clinical administration of COVID-19 vaccines.},

Title = {Queer futuring: an approach to critical futuring strategies for adult

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop queer futuring
   strategies that take into consideration adult learners' needs in support
   of transformational and sustainable change for social justice and
   equity. Design/methodology/approach This paper develops the construct of
   queer futuring, which engages queer theory perspectives in a critical
   futures framework. Adult learning theory informs queer futuring
   strategies to support adults and inform education to sustain
   transformational changes for social justice and equity. Findings With
   social justice in mind, queer futuring opens spaces and supports
   opportunities for adults to engage in learning activities that address
   historical and layered forms of oppression. Building on learning needs
   of adults to create meaning and make a difference in the world around
   them, queer futuring strategies provide tools for activism, advocacy and
   building new relationships and ways of being-with. Research
   limitations/implications The sustainability of our current system of
   growth and financial well-being has already been called into question,
   and the current pandemic provides tangible evidence of values for
   contribution, connection and concern for others, even in the midst of
   political strife and conspiracy theories. These shifting values and
   values conflict of society point to the questions of equity and
   narrative inclusivity, challenging and disrupting dominant paradigms and
   structures that have perpetuated power and authority ``over{''} rather
   than social participation ``with{''} and harmony. Queer futuring is just
   the beginning of a bigger conversation about transforming society.
   Practical implications Queering spaces from the perspective of queer
   futuring keeps the adult learner and queering processes in mind with an
   emphasis on affiliation and belonging, identity and resistance and
   politics and change. Social implications The authors suggest queer
   futuring makes room for opening spaces of creativity and insight as
   traditional and reified rationality is problematized, further supporting
   development of emergentist relationships with the future as spaces of
   possibility and innovation. Originality/value Queer futuring connects
   ethical and pragmatic approaches to futuring for creating the kinds of
   futures needed to decolonize, delegitimize and disrupt hegemonic and
   categorical thinking and social structures. It builds on queer theory's
   critical perspective, engaging critical futures strategies with adult
   learners at the forefront.},

Title = {Resurrecting Maunder's ghost: John ``Jack' Eddy, the Maunder Minimum,
   and the rise of a dilettante astrophysicist},

Abstract = {During the 1970s, widespread scientific interest in the risks of climate
   change prompted John A. Eddy (1931-2009), an astrophysicist with the
   National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO, to investigate
   whether sunspots could be used to predict future climate changes.
   Methodologically, Eddy's investigations were uniquely historical in
   nature. By interrogating old manuscripts of solar observations since the
   early seventeenth century, he identified what appeared to be a
   correlation between the so-called Maunder Minimum - a virtual cessation
   of sunspots between 1645 and 1715 - and severely cold temperatures
   during the Little Ice Age. While he could not identify the physical
   mechanisms that governed solar-climate relationships, this historical
   episode fostered his curiosity. Fortuitously, Eddy's solar-climate
   research coincided with efforts to use satellites to monitor and record
   variations in solar energy output, which in context constituted a
   significant development in managing environmental and technological
   risk.But using the Maunder Minimum to advance the frontiers of knowledge
   about solar-terrestrial relationships was not Eddy's only - or even
   primary - motivation. In the mid-1840s, German astronomer Heinrich
   Schwabe (1789-1875) discovered what appeared to be a decadal sunspot
   cycle, the existence of which inspired generations of astrophysicists to
   more precisely estimate its length as well as determine its underlying
   causes. Eddy, however, came to believe that the astronomical community
   failed to consider the implications of subsequent evidence suggesting
   that Schwabe's solar cycle was not an enduring characteristic of the
   sun. Instead, he reasoned that evidence offered by nineteenth-century
   European astronomers Gustav Sporer and Edward Maunder in the 1880s and
   1890s had been entirely overlooked. But rather than arguing that their
   evidence was overlooked in error, Eddy identified what he cast as a
   conspiracy of wilful ignorance on the part of a staid and conservative
   astronomical community. By utilizing Eddy's private hand-written notes
   as they appeared in undergraduate lectures, public speeches and academic
   talks, as well as his appreciation for the seminal views of sociologist
   of science Thomas Kuhn, I show that Eddy sought to rectify this
   injustice by proposing a contrasting vision of science as an
   interdisciplinary, collaborative and creative process of exploring the
   ignored areas between scientific disciplines.},

Abstract = {We demonstrate that the feedback from stellar bulges can, in principle,
   play an essential role in shaping the halo gas of galaxies with
   substantial bulge components by conducting 1D hydrodynamical
   simulations. The feedback model we consider consists of two distinct
   phases: (i) an early starburst during the bulge formation and (ii) a
   subsequent long-lasting mass and energy injection from stellar winds of
   low-mass stars and Type Ia supernovae. An energetic outward blastwave is
   initiated by the starburst and maintained and enhanced by the
   long-lasting stellar feedback. For a Milky Way like galactic bulge, this
   blastwave heats up the circum-galactic medium to a scale much beyond the
   virial radius, thus the gas accretion into the halo can be completely
   stopped. In addition to that, the long-lasting feedback in the later
   phase powers a galactic bulge wind that is reverse-shocked at a large
   radius in the presence of circum-galactic medium and hence maintains a
   hot gaseous halo. As the mass and energy injection decreases with time,
   the feedback evolves to a subsonic and quasi-stable outflow, which is
   enough to prevent halo gas from cooling. The two phases of the feedback
   thus re-enforce each other's impact on the gas dynamics. The simulation
   results demonstrate that the stellar bulge feedback may provide a
   plausible solution to the long-standing problems in understanding the
   Milky Way type galaxies, such as the `missing stellar feedback' problem
   and the `overcooling' problem. The central point of the present model is
   that the conspiracy of the two-phase feedback keeps a low density and a
   high temperature for the circum-galactic medium so that its X-ray
   emission is significantly lowered and the radiative cooling is largely
   suppressed. The simulations also show that the properties of the hot gas
   in the subsonic outflow state depend sensitively on the environment and
   the formation history of the bulge. This dependence and variance may
   explain the large dispersion in the X-ray to B-band luminosity ratio of
   the low L(X)/L(B) elliptical galaxies.},

Abstract = {I first sketch the history of the German Physical Society (Deutsche
   Physikalische Gesellschaft,DPG) from its founding by six young Berlin
   scientists as the Physical Society of Berlin (Physikalische Gesellschaft
   zu Berlin) in 1845, through its renaming as the DPG in 1899 and its rise
   to prominence by the beginning of the 1930s. I then turn to the history
   of the DPG during the Third Reich, which can be divided into two
   periods, from the transfer of power in Germany to the Nazis in 1933 to
   1940, and from 1941 to 1945. During the first period, Johannes Stark
   (1874-1957), one of the leaders of the ``German Physics{''} (Deutsche
   Physik) movement, attempted to gain election as the Chairman of the DPG
   in September 1933 but was repulsed. A period of relative autonomy of the
   DPG from Nazi ideology and policies ensued, which gradually was
   transformed into one of accommodation, until at the end of the 1938,
   Peter Debye (1884-1966), then Chairman of the DPG, bowed to governmental
   demands and Nazi activists in the DPG, introduced Nazi principles, and
   strongly advised the Jewish members of the DPG to withdraw from it.
   Debye left Germany in early 1940, and after a transitional period in
   which Jonathan Zenneck (1871-1959) served as Acting Chairman, Carl
   Ramsauer (1879-1955) was elected Chairman of the DPG in December 1940,
   thus opening the second period, the Ramsauer era, which lasted from 1941
   until the end of the war in 1945. Ramsauer oversaw the self-coordination
   (Selbstgleichschaltung) of the DPG to the Nazi regime, and as an
   industrial physicist he led the DPG to establish ever more alliances
   with powerful figures in the military-industrial complex of Nazi
   Germany, which worked to the advantage both of Ramsauer and the DPG and
   to that of the Nazi regime during the course of the war. Finally, as the
   military defeat of Germany loomed, Ramsauer took steps aimed at insuring
   the survival of German physics in the postwar period. After the war, he
   masked the wartime activities of himself and the DPG, thereby
   contributing to the postwar conspiracy of silence or minimization of the
   Nazi past in Germany.},

Abstract = {Background. COVID-19 has changed the way that governments communicate
   and engage with citizens. In emergencies, effective communication must
   be immediate, grounded in science, transparent, easy to understand and
   in language-appropriate messaging delivered through multiple and varied
   platforms. For the South African (SA) COVID-19 response, the intent was
   to design an agile, locally relevant Risk Communication and Community
   Engagement (RCCE) strategy as the pandemic was unfolding and to
   constantly evaluate its implementation. Early involvement of communities
   in the formulation and direction of a risk communication plan is
   essential to its success. Objective. To outline the significance of the
   RCCE???s robust communication strategy during the COVID-19 response and
   the lessons learnt in executing the strategy. Methods. This is a
   qualitative review of documents and reports generated and utilised by
   the RCCE Technical Working Group (TWG) and reflects the lessons learnt
   from discussions and multiple engagements at district, provincial and
   national levels. The review incorporates lessons learnt from
   international practice, resource documents from the World Health
   Organization (WHO), RCCE readiness and response to coronavirus disease,
   feedback from the Behavioural Science Ministerial Advisory Committee,
   input from the call centre, website and various established social media
   platforms. Results. Communication and building trust with multiple
   stakeholders begin before an outbreak and is a prerequisite to
   facilitate the timeous flow of information, particularly in the context
   of a rapidly evolving outbreak of a new disease, where the scientific
   community does not immediately have all the answers. Initial COVID-19
   messages were therefore filled with challenges that ranged from the lack
   of scientific and epidemiological information to rumours, conspiracy
   theories and misinformation. The findings validate that empowering
   communities to act, strengthening public trust and community
   participation using multiple channels as well as timely responses to
   rumours and misinformation are important drivers of COVID-19
   communication efforts in SA. Communication efforts must be accelerated
   to translate science into locally relevant languages and the impact of
   interventions must be measured to appropriately direct limited
   resources. Conclusion. The risk communication strategy incorporated
   several key lessons that could be used to improve communication and
   inform future emergency response communication that is immediate,
   science-based, transparent, inclusive and encourages community
   participation.},

Title = {Young adults' preferences for influenza vaccination campaign messages:
   Implications for COVID-19 vaccine intervention design and development},
Journal = {BRAIN, BEHAVIOR, \& IMMUNITY - HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Health campaign interventions, particularly those tailored
   to the target audience's needs and pref-erences, can cost-effectively
   change people's attitudes and behaviors towards better health
   decision-making. However, there is limited research on how to best
   tailor seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns for young adults.
   Vaccination is vital in protecting young adults and their social circles
   (vulnerable populations like older adults) from the influenza virus and
   critical in shaping these emerging adults' vaccination habits in the
   long run. However, amid the prevalence of easily-accessible,
   attention-grabbing, and often malicious false and misinfor-mation (e.g.,
   COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theories), it may be more challenging to
   develop vaccination messages that resonate with young adults well enough
   to attract their attention. Therefore, to bridge the research gap, this
   study examines young adults' preferences for seasonal influenza
   vaccination campaigns to inform effective intervention design and
   development. Methods: Qualitative survey questions were developed to
   gauge young adults' preferences for seasonal influenza vaccination
   campaigns. A total of 545 young adults (73.9\% female, Mage = 19.89, SD
   = 1.44) from a large University offered complete answers to a
   cross-sectional online survey. Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis
   procedures were adopted to guide the data analysis process. Results:
   Thematic analysis revealed that young adults prefer seasonal influenza
   vaccination campaigns that rely on (1) quality and balanced information
   from (2) credible information sources, positioned in the (3) relevant
   health contexts, (4) emphasize actionable messages, and incorporate (5)
   persuasive campaign design. Interestingly, while many participants
   underscored the importance of fear-appeal messages in persuading them to
   take health actions, some young adults also suggested avoiding fear
   campaigns due to discomfort. Conclusions: Insights of the study can
   inform seasonal influenza vaccination design and development, and have
   the potential to shed light on vaccination messaging in other vaccine
   contexts, such as COVID-19 vaccines. Results also underscore the need
   for health experts and government officials to adopt a more nuanced
   approach when selecting persuasive campaign appeals. While some young
   adults may resonate well with fear appeals, others may not. Future
   research could examine the underlying mechanisms that drive young
   adults' preference for vacci-nation campaign intervention to enrich the
   literature further.},

Title = {Anatomy of \# Plandemi Infodemic: A Case Study on Misinformation
   Diffusion During the Covid-19 Pandemic},

   STUDIES},

Abstract = {Just as the COVID-19 pandemic has spread with the transportation
   networks of the globalizing world, the infodemic is spreading globally
   with social media networks. The diffusion potential of social media with
   its complex structure of mass and interpersonal communication provides
   the distribution of helpful information. Yet, it can also cause the
   distribution of information pollution. Information pollution can become
   massive with the intensified interaction between users and cause
   infodemic. The World Health Organization secs infodcmic as a global
   problem that needs to be tackled as much as the pandemic in terms of
   human health. It leads to information pollution and misleads people's
   attitudes towards the virus and vaccine. After the video titled
   ``Plandemic: The I lidden Agenda Behind COVID-19{''} was published on
   social media platforms such as Youtube and Facebook on May 4, 2020, it
   spread rapidly and became one of the concrete cases of the infodemic.
   The video spread rapidly with the shares of the viewers in the two days
   it was broadcast and reached the number of views close to two million.
   It has drawn the masses into its magic circle by packaging the COVID-19
   claims that are voiced by groups prone to conspiracy theories. Although
   the video was taken down in a slightly short time, the misinformation it
   contained remained in circulation globally through interactions on
   social media. In this research, the reflections of the Plandemic video
   in Turkey were determined by the content produced by the users on
   Twitter via the \#Plandemi hashtag. The primary purpose of the research
   is to examine how false information is spread in social media by giving
   examples. Stuctured as a case study, this research conducts network
   analysis and content analysis to the posts with the \#Plandemi hashtag
   on Twitter. As a result of the network analysis, power-law distribution
   has been determined in the interaction between users and message
   production. As a result of the content analysis, it was determined that
   there was a contextual overlap with the Plandemic video, especially in
   the theme of insecurity in the health system. In this respect, the study
   represents an example of the global fluidity of the infodemic while
   describing how disinformation is spreading in Turkey in the context of
   COVID-19.},

Title = {The Kulakization of the Peasantry The OGPU and the End of Faith in
   Peasant Reconciliation, 1924-1927},
Journal = {JAHRBUCHER FUR GESCHICHTE OSTEUROPAS},
Year = {2012},

Pages = {34-57},
Abstract = {Beginning with the 1922/23 agricultural season the secret police,
   particular at the local level, provided more or less correct information
   to the Center about life in the villages. Rather than concentrating on
   ``anti-Soviet{''} conspiracies and links to political dissidents, the
   police focused on the concrete economic and social situation and
   attributed the displeasure of the peasantry to genuine economic and
   fiscal problems including an almost unbearable tax burden, an
   insufficient supply of industrial goods, low agricultural prices, and
   the unpredictability of the tax rate. As late as the beginning of 1924,
   the OGPU argued that policy changes leading to improvements in the
   economic situation of the countryside, especially a reduction of the tax
   burden on the peasants, would result in increased support for Soviet
   Power. The peasants could still be won over for the revolution. Peasant
   hostility toward party and state was not inevitable. However, under the
   impact of drought and famine in 1924, which produced mass movements of
   refugees, epidemics, increased banditry, and religious interpretations
   of the disaster, and growing resistance against paternalism, domination
   and exploitation as seen in the response of the peasantry as a whole to
   the ``Face to the Countryside{''} campaign and the rural elections of
   1924-1925, the secret police, particularly the Central OGPU, began to
   lose faith in their own argument regarding the possibility of winning
   the peasantry. The political decision to declare war on the peasantry
   had yet to be made in 1924; the language of that war and the necessary
   mental construct of a unified peasant enemy, however, had been perfected
   by the end of that year. This tendency became far more pronounced
   following Dzherzhinskii's death in July 1926 and the increase in
   authority within the OGPU of Stalin's prot g Iagoda, who from 1924 had
   been warning of growing anti-Soviet agitation amongst the peasantry.
   Peasant unrest was now explained simply by the influence of kulaks. By
   1927 essentially all peasants were ``kulaks,{''} though reports from the
   local secret police as late as 1928 demonstrate that the Central OGPU
   had to have known better.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a comparative study of typical and atypical
   consonant harmony (onset-onset place harmony), with emphasis on (i) the
   size of the harmonic domain, (ii) the position of the harmonic domain
   within the prosodic word, and (iii) the maximal size of the prosodic
   word that exhibits consonant harmony. The data, drawn from typically and
   atypically developing Hebrew-speaking children, reveal the following
   characteristics: (i) The harmonic domain is usually limited to two
   consonants in typical harmony, but may span to up to four consonants in
   atypical harmony. (ii) The harmonic domain usually aligns with the left
   edge of the prosodic word in typical harmony, but may also align with
   the right edge of the prosodic word in atypical harmony. (iii) Typical
   consonant harmony is usually limited to maximally trisyllabic
   productions, while atypical harmony is also found in quadrisyllabic
   productions. In addition, the sporadic variation characterizing early
   typical speech appears in advanced stages in atypical speech. With
   reference to the hierarchical structure of the word, these distinctions
   are analyzed here in terms of (a-)synchronization between the
   development of the prosodic word layer (number of syllables) and the
   segmental layer. The formal analysis is couched within the framework of
   Optimal Domains Theory (Cole, J., Kisseberth, C., 1994. An optimal
   domain theory of harmony. Studies in the Linguistic Sciences 24, 1-13,

Abstract = {This Note analyzes whether federal customer and employee discrimination
   claims brought in federal court against dispensaries and other marijuana
   businesses in legalizing states can prevail. This inquiry strikes at the
   core of marijuana's complicated legal status in our dual-federalism
   system, in which the drug remains outlawed under the federal Controlled
   Substances Act of 1970 (CSA), yet flourishes in many legalizing state
   markets with tacit approval from the Justice Department.
   The Note begins by probing the issue through the lens of Title III of
   the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A simple question is posited:
   can a disabled person sue a dispensary in federal court in a legalizing
   state for injunctive relief if the dispensary fails to ``make reasonable
   accommodations{''} for access. Under Title III, all businesses that
   operate as ``places of public accommodation{''} must ordinarily ``remove
   architectural barriers ... in existing facilities ... where such removal
   is readily achievable{''} to accommodate disabled patrons. But several
   common law and prudential legal doctrines present obstacles to a federal
   court's ability to grant customer access to marijuana storefronts under
   Title III. This Note analyzes these legal limitations, as well as the
   history, text, and administration of Title III, to propose a legal
   framework that empowers courts to issue relief.
   Leveraging its Title III analysis, the Note then analyzes federal
   protections for employees. It reaches a troubling conclusion: hundreds
   of thousands of employees of marijuana businesses in the United States
   are very likely unprotected by federal civil rights laws, including
   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in
   Employment Act, Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the
   Fair Labor Standards Act. Because these employees are engaging in an
   ongoing federal criminal conspiracy, a federal court is unlikely to
   grant backpay, frontpay, or reinstatement if these employees suffer
   flagrant sexual harassment, racial discrimination, or any other
   violation of federal employee protections in the workplace. Generally,
   these employees can only obtain relief through a patchwork of state
   employment laws. This outcome is especially disconcerting because
   members of identity-based groups protected by federal employment
   statutes are often disproportionately targeted by marijuana arrests and
   convictions-and because roughly 80\% of cannabis business owners are
   white.},

Abstract = {Knowledge is supremacy and the more knowledgeable we are about
   information break-in, we are less prone to fall prey to the evil hacker
   sharks of information technology. The information technology is
   perpetually emerging and we are all beyond doubt minuscule gravels in a
   cosmic marine of information. Knowledge is pre-eminence, but as humble
   users of the most modern technologies we are pitted with possessions
   that may even make us paranoid concerning usage of a computer. Don't be
   discouraged though, as we will tell the techniques to protect ourselves
   while we are reaching an accord.
   Privacy preserving data mining (i.e., is accomplishing valid data mining
   results devoid of the wisdom of the core data values) has been receiving
   attentiveness in the research society and beyond. Reaching a pact is
   defined as negotiation and the process ends in a ultimate contract
   between the participating parties.
   Automated Negotiation uses a wide variety of machine learning
   techniques. One foremost hindrance in automated negotiation is
   incorporating acumen into a computer system that carries out a
   negotiation {[}11], thus enabling the negotiation system to carry out
   automated negotiations efficiently and shrewdly on behalf of its
   clients. This paper presents an idea about the privacy preserving
   negotiation that is performed between individuals dealing with
   negotiating databases of users. It uses association rules and entropy
   discretization. As the BIRCH algorithms performance is extensive in
   terms of memory requirements, run time, clustering quality, stability
   and scalability it is used for data clustering and merging the data
   without disclosing the private and sensitive details of the user's data.
   The sensitive data are protected from the other user by using a protocol
   defined. It has lower communication complexity secure protocol; it will
   not disclose the private data's of the parties participating and it
   resists some degree of conspiracy and malevolent attacks.
   Entropy gives the information required in bits. After splitting of data,
   the insensitive data are fused and the results are obtained. This
   negotiation presented is of high order by using a low communication
   protocol between the users. The protocol used for the negotiation
   process provides the definite rules and conditions for merging the data
   tables.},

Title = {Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of Adult Iraqi Population Towards
   COVID-19 Booster Dose: A Cross-Sectional Study},

Abstract = {Purpose: COVID-19 vaccines are critical for containing the pandemic and
   preventing serious SARS-CoV-2 infections. In addition to the two main
   doses, a booster dose has been utilized to improve immunity. The aim of
   current study is to evaluate Iraqi adult population knowledge,
   attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 booster dose. Subjects and
   Methods: This online cross-sectional survey of adult Iraqis (n = 754)
   assessed the attitudes of people who have had both immunizations
   regarding a potential COVID-19 vaccine booster dosage and to identify
   potential factors that might impact these attitudes. Factors evaluated
   in the current study included previously received vaccine type in the
   first two doses, socioeconomic characteristics, health status, knowledge
   about COVID-19 and its vaccines and adherence to protective practices.
   Results: Overall, 61.1\% of participants expressed willingness to
   receive a COVID-19 booster dose, with a high median score of knowledge
   and practice toward COVID-19. Participants who did not perceive COVID-19
   to be serious, p-value <0.001), participants who believed they would not
   be infected with COVID-19 in the next 6 months (p-value <0.001), low
   knowledge score group (p-value <0.001), lower education (p-value
   <0.001), participants who received the COVID-19 vaccine because of
   imposed laws (p-value <0.001), participants who received AstraZeneca
   vaccine (p-value <0.001), younger participants (p-value=0.003), low
   level of practice (p-value <0.001), participants who did not know
   someone who had died due to COVID-19 (p-value=0.01), low risk of
   developing serious side effects if infected with COVID-19 and
   participants in the low side effects score were significantly less
   frequently willing to receive a booster COVID-19 dose (p-value <0.001).
   The main reasons for booster dose hesitancy/refusal were the perceived
   lack of need for a booster shot, the uselessness of a booster shot and
   the conspiracy theory of boosting corporate profits through booster
   shots. Conclusion: There is high hesitancy towards COVID-19 booster dose
   acceptance among the Iraqi population. The study identified several
   factors associated with vaccine hesitancy including low socioeconomic
   status and low knowledge about COVID-19 and its vaccines.},

Abstract = {The information about the sources of supply, trafficking routes,
   distribution patterns and conspiracy links can be obtained from
   methamphetamine profiling. The precursor and synthetic method for the
   clandestine manufacture can be estimated from the analysis of minor
   impurities contained in methamphetamine. Also, the similarity between
   samples can be evaluated using the peaks that appear in chromatograms.
   In South Korea, methamphetamine was the most popular drug but the total
   seized amount of methamphetamine whole through the country was very
   small. Therefore, it would be more important to find the links between
   samples than the other uses of methamphetamine profiling. Many Asian
   countries including Japan and South Korea have been using the method
   developed by National Research Institute of Police Science of Japan. The
   method used gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID), DB-5
   column and four internal standards. It was developed to increase the
   amount of impurities and minimize the amount of methamphetamine. After
   GC-FID analysis, the raw data have to be processed. The data processing
   steps are very complex and require a lot of time and effort. In this
   study, Microsoft Visual Basic Application (VBA) modules were developed
   to handle these data processing steps. This module collected the results
   from the data into an Excel file and then corrected the retention time
   shift and response deviation generated from the sample preparation and
   instruments analysis. The developed modules were tested for their
   performance using 10 samples from 5 different cases. The processed
   results were analyzed with Pearson correlation coefficient for
   similarity assessment and the correlation coefficient of the two samples
   from the same case was more than 0.99. When the modules were applied to
   131 seized methamphetamine samples, four samples from two different
   cases were found to have the common origin and the chromatograms of the
   four samples were appeared visually identical. The developed VBA modules
   could process raw data of GC-FID very quickly and easily. Also, they
   could assess the similarity between samples by peak pattern recognition
   using whole peaks without spectral identification of each peak that
   appeared in the chromatogram. The results collectively suggest that the
   modules would be useful tools to augment similarity assessment between
   seized methamphetamine samples. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

   information on misinformation and the social media environment during a
   fear-inducing disease outbreak to improve communication practices. The
   purpose of this study was to describe the content of Ebola-related
   tweets with a specific focus on misinformation, political content,
   health related content, risk framing, and rumors. Methods We examined
   tweets from a random 1\% sample of all tweets published September 30th -
   October 30th, 2014, filtered for English-language tweets mentioning
   ``Ebola{''} in the content or hashtag, that had at least 1 retweet (N =
   72,775 tweets). A randomly selected subset of 3639 (5\%) tweets were
   evaluated for inclusion. We analyzed the 3113 tweets that meet inclusion
   criteria using public health trained human coders to assess tweet
   characteristics (joke, opinion, discord), veracity (true, false,
   partially false), political context, risk frame, health context, Ebola
   specific messages, and rumors. We assessed the proportion of tweets with
   specific content using descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests.
   Results Of non-joke tweets, 10\% of Ebola-related tweets contained false
   or partially false information. Twenty-five percent were related to
   politics, 28\% contained content that provoked reader response or
   promoted discord, 42\% contained risk elevating messages and 72\% were
   related to health. The most frequent rumor mentioned focused on
   government conspiracy. When comparing tweets with true information to
   tweets with misinformation, a greater percentage of tweets with
   misinformation were political in nature (36\% vs 15\%) and contained
   discord-inducing statements (45\% vs 10\%). Discord-inducing statements
   and political messages were both significantly more common in tweets
   containing misinformation compared with those without(p < 0.001).
   Conclusions Results highlight the importance of anticipating
   politicization of disease outbreaks, and the need for policy makers and
   social media companies to build partnerships and develop response
   frameworks in advance of an event. While each public health event is
   different, our findings provide insight into the possible social media
   environment during a future epidemic and could help optimize potential
   public health communication strategies.},

Title = {COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the adult population in Ghana: evidence
   from a pre-vaccination rollout survey},
Journal = {TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH},
Year = {2021},

Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already claimed over
   four million lives globally and over 800 deaths in Ghana. The COVID-19
   vaccine is a key intervention towards containing the pandemic. Over
   three billion doses of the vaccine have already been administered
   globally and over 800,000 doses administered in Ghana, representing less
   than 5\% vaccination coverage. Fear, uncertainty, conspiracy theories
   and safety concerns remain important threats to, a successful rollout of
   the vaccine if not managed well. Objective Ascertain the predictors of
   citizens' probability of participating in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and
   subsequently accept the vaccine when given the opportunity. Methodology
   The study was an online nation-wide survey among community members (n =
   1556) from 18th September to 23rd October, 2020 in the 16 regions in
   Ghana. Binary probit regression analysis with marginal effect
   estimations was employed to ascertain the predictors of community
   members' willingness to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and
   uptake the vaccine. Results Approximately 60\% of respondents said they
   will not participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial; 65\% will take the
   vaccine, while 69\% will recommend it to others. Willingness to
   voluntarily participate in COVID-19 vaccine trial, uptake the vaccine
   and advise others to do same was higher among adults aged 18-48 years,
   the unmarried and males (p < 0.05). Significant predictors of
   unwillingness to participate in the COVID-19 vaccine trial and uptake of
   the vaccine are: married persons, females, Muslims, older persons,
   residents of less urbanised regions and persons with lower or no formal
   education (p < 0.05). Predominant reasons cited for unwillingness to
   participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and take the vaccine included
   fear, safety concerns, lack of trust in state institutions, uncertainty,
   political connotations, spiritual and religious beliefs. Conclusion The
   probability of accepting COVID-19 vaccine among the adult population in
   Ghana is high but the country should not get complacent because fear,
   safety and mistrust are important concerns that have the potential to
   entrench vaccine hesitancy. COVID-19 vaccine rollout campaigns should be
   targeted and cognisant of the key predictors of citizens' perceptions of
   the vaccine. These lessons when considered will promote Ghana's efforts
   towards vaccinating at least 20 million people to attain herd immunity.},

Abstract = {The author reconstructs one of the largest operations undertaken by the
   Security Service in sixties. It was a part of various activities of
   communist authorities to limit contacts of Polish citizens with the West
   and Polish emigration. On of the most fiercely fought enemies was Radio
   Free Europe, which was successfully breaking the information monopoly of
   the Polish communist authorities.
   In 1963 Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, who during the war was an AK (Home Army)
   soldier and activist of Council to Aid the Jews, and during the
   stalinism period was imprisoned for many years, began conspiracy
   co-operation with Radio Free Europe. With a group of co-operators (who
   were also ex-AK soldiers) he regularly passed to Munich information
   about situation in Poland - repressions and harassment against the
   intellectuals, Church, opposition. This information was the basis of
   numerous important programmes of Radio Free Europe. SB found the traces
   of his activities in 1966, using the bug information and intelligence
   sources. Bartoszewski and his co-operators were kept under meticulous
   surveillance for many years, SB tried to intimidate them, enrol for
   co-operation, isolate in their environments. Help of Stasi and KGB was
   used. The most important aims of Security Service was to discover,
   transfer channels{''} (ways of passing the information from Poland
   abroad) and to find evidence which would allow to sue Bartoszewski. They
   succeeded only in 1970, when his co-operators: Stanislaw Salmonowicz,
   Danuta Bankowska, Ewa Drezepolska were arrested. Wladyslaw Bartoszewski
   was questioned many times and the Service tried to enrol him. After his
   flat refusal, the Service used their net of secret agents to spread
   rumours and forged documents, which were to discredit Bartoszewski as a
   professed agent of Ministry of Interior. Simultaneously a lawsuit, which
   was to be a propaganda blow against Radio Free Europe, was being
   prepared. These plans were ceased only after dramatic events in Gdynia,
   Gdansk and Szczecin in December 1970 and changes on the authorities'
   top. New Gierek's team, who wanted to present their, liberal{''} face
   withdrew plans for lawsuit and released the three arrested people.
   Nevertheless they were still, together with Bartoszewski, subject to
   harassment and surveillance. Bartoszewski continued his co-operation
   with Radio Free Europe.},

   Vaccination: Validation of a Survey Instrument among Young Females in
   Jordan Pending Vaccine Authorization},
Journal = {VACCINES},

Abstract = {In May 2023, the U.S. FDA advisors endorsed Pfizer's
   pregnancy-administered vaccine (branded ABRYSVO) to protect infants from
   respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Vaccination can reduce the
   burden of RSV-related respiratory disease, with previous studies showing
   its substantial medical and financial burden in Jordan. However,
   pregnant women may exhibit hesitancy to get vaccinated due to concerns
   about potential risks to themselves or their fetuses. This study aimed
   to assess the acceptance of the RSV vaccine among young females and
   identify the determinants influencing their decision using a newly
   constructed instrument. A survey instrument was developed and validated,
   comprising 26 items to measure RSV vaccine acceptance. A cross-sectional
   study design was employed, with data collection from a sample of females
   aged 18 to 45 residing in Jordan during 5-6 July 2023, using a
   convenient approach via an online distributed questionnaire. The final
   study sample comprised 315 respondents, with 67.6\% who have heard of
   RSV before the study. If the vaccine was safe, effective, and provided
   freely, 70.2\% showed willingness to get the RSV vaccine, 15.2\%
   resisted, and 14.6\% were hesitant. Principal component analysis
   identified six internally consistent sub-scales with the following
   suggested themes: Advice, Burden, Conspiracy, Dangers, Efficiency, and
   Fear, comprising 21 items collectively as assigned as the ``ABCDEF{''}
   scale for RSV vaccine acceptance. RSV vaccine acceptance in this study
   was associated with the advice and fear constructs. The validated survey
   instrument successfully captured important determinants of RSV vaccine
   acceptance among young females. RSV vaccine promotion efforts should
   focus on the following: enhancing vaccine education, improving trust in
   healthcare institutions and providers, reducing burdens through
   resolving cost issues and focusing on the role of social support,
   addressing safety concerns, and tailoring communication strategies to
   effectively promote the benefits of the vaccine. These insights can
   inform public health policies and interventions aiming to promote RSV
   vaccination and mitigate the burden of RSV-related diseases among
   infants. Follow-up studies are recommended with pregnant women as the
   target group to assess their attitude towards RSV vaccination and to
   confirm the validity of the conceived ABCDEF survey instrument.},

Abstract = {The interannual variability of atmospheric CO2 growth rate shows
   remarkable correlation with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
   Here we present results from mechanistically based terrestrial carbon
   cycle model VEgetation-Global-Atmosphere-Soil (VEGAS), forced by
   observed climate fields such as precipitation and temperature. Land is
   found to explain most of the interannual CO2 variability with a
   magnitude of about 5 PgC yr(-1). The simulated land-atmosphere flux has
   a detrended correlation of 0.53 (0.6 at the 2-7 year ENSO band) with the
   CO2 growth rate observed at Mauna Loa from 1965 to 2000. We also present
   the total ocean flux from the Hamburg Ocean Carbon Cycle Model ( HAMOCC)
   which shows ocean-atmosphere flux variation of about 1 PgC yr(-1), and
   it is largely out of phase with land flux. On land, much of the change
   comes from the tropical regions such as the Amazon and Indonesia where
   ENSO related climate anomalies are in the same direction across much of
   the tropics. The subcontinental variations over North America and
   Eurasia are comparable to the tropics but the total interannual
   variability is about 1 PgC yr(-1) due to the cancellation from the
   subregions. This has implication for flux measurement network
   distribution. The tropical dominance also results from a ``conspiracy''
   between climate and plant/soil physiology, as precipitation and
   temperature changes drive opposite changes in net primary production
   (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (R-h), both contributing to
   land-atmosphere flux changes in the same direction. However, NPP
   contributes to about three fourths of the total tropical interannual
   variation and the rest is from heterotrophic respiration; thus
   precipitation appears to be a more important factor than temperature on
   the interannual timescales as tropical wet and dry regimes control
   vegetation growth. Fire, largely driven by drought, also contributes
   significantly to the interannual CO2 variability at a rate of about 1
   PgC yr(-1), and it is not totally in phase with NPP or R-h. The robust
   variability in tropical fluxes agree well with atmospheric inverse
   modeling results. Even over North America and Eurasia, where ENSO
   teleconnection is less robust, the fluxes show general agreement with
   inversion results, an encouraging sign for fruitful carbon data
   assimilation.},

Abstract = {Introduction COVID-19 parallels HIV in many ways. Socio-behavioural
   science has been critical in elucidating the context and factors
   surrounding individual levels of engagement with known effective
   prevention and treatment tools for HIV, thus offering important lessons
   for ongoing efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion
   Non-adherence to effective disease mitigation strategies (e.g. condoms
   for HIV and masks for COVID-19) can be attributed in part to
   prioritizing comfort, convenience and individual autonomy over public
   health. Importantly, misinformation can fuel denialism and conspiracies
   that discredit scientific knowledge and motivate nonadherence. These
   preferences and the extent to which individuals can act on their
   preferences may be constrained by the structures and culture in which
   they live. Both HIV and COVID-19 have been politicized and influenced by
   evolving recommendations from scientists, clinicians, policymakers and
   politically motivated organizations. While vaccines are vital for ending
   both pandemics, their impact will depend on availability and uptake.
   Four decades of experience with the HIV epidemic have shown that
   information alone is insufficient to overcome these challenges;
   interventions must address the underlying, often complex factors that
   influence human behaviour. This article builds from socio-behavioural
   science theory and describes practical and successful approaches to
   enable and support adherence to prevention and treatment strategies,
   including vaccine adoption. Key methods include reframing tools to
   enhance motivation, promoting centralized sources of trusted
   information, strategic development and messaging with and within key
   populations (e.g. through social media) and appealing to
   self-empowerment, altruism and informed decision making. Orchestrated
   evidence-based activism is needed to overcome manipulative
   politicization, while consistent transparent messaging around scientific
   discoveries and clinical recommendations are critical for public
   acceptance and support. Ultimately, the effectiveness of COVID-19
   vaccines will depend on our ability to engender trust in the communities
   most affected. Conclusions Many lessons learned from socio-behavioural
   science in the HIV pandemic are applicable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Individual behaviour must be understood within its interpersonal and
   societal context to address the current barriers to adherence to
   disease-mitigating strategies and promote an effective response to the
   COVID-19 pandemic, which is likely to be endured for the foreseeable
   future.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the sources of information on the direct contact of
   the Emperor Frederick II with the Mongols before the attack of the
   latter on Europe, the persistent rumors of his collusion with the
   invaders, who came to blow mainly to the enemies of Frederick, the
   refusal of the Emperor of an armed clash with the Tatars, the refusal to
   participate in the Crusade prepared by the German prelates against the
   Tatars, but instead - a withdrawal of the imperial troops in Italy and
   the siege of Rome in order to force the pope to recognize the supremacy
   of the Emperor, the sudden retreat of the Tartars themselves from the
   German border and the abandonment of the original plans for the conquest
   of Germany, unexpected counteraction against Frederick of the German
   prelates who had been previously loyal to the Emperor and who accused
   him of a serious crime against the Church and the whole of Christianity.
   The author concludes that the Emperor Frederick and the leaders of the
   Western Mongol campaign were associated with secret mutual obligations.
   Many of his contemporaries were aware of the Emperor's secret contacts
   with the Tartars (Albert von Beheim, Matthew Paris, and others.). The
   author analyzes the information and is trying to separate the elements
   of political propaganda from the established facts. The Emperor's
   conspiracy with the Tatar leaders is indicated both by direct evidence
   and numerous indirect information analyzed in the article. On the one
   hand, the Emperor did everything possible to avoid a direct military
   confrontation with the Tatars and disrupt plans of his supporters in
   Germany to combat the invaders. On the other hand, the Tatar impact in
   Europe fell entirely on the Friedrich's enemies who took the side of the
   pope in the latter's conflict with Emperor. As a result of the Tatar
   invasion of Europe position of the Emperor in his confrontation with the
   Roman church greatly strengthened. This change in the balance of power
   obviously angered the church prelates and the subsequent rebellion of
   the German Bishops against Friedrich provoked long civil war in Germany.},

Abstract = {Background and objectives: The investigation of cognitive biases has
   considerably broadened our understanding of the cognitive underpinnings
   of schizophrenia. This is the first study to investigate the illusory
   truth or validity effect in schizophrenia, which denotes the phenomenon
   that the renewed exposure to difficult knowledge questions shifts
   responses toward affirmation. We hypothesized an excess of the truth
   effect in schizophrenia, which may play a role in the maintenance of the
   disorder, particularly relating to positive symptoms.
   Methods: The study was set up over the Internet. The final analyses
   considered 36 patients with a probable diagnosis of schizophrenia, and a
   sample of 40 healthy subjects. Both groups took part on two occasions.
   In the baseline survey, difficult knowledge questions on neutral (e.g.,
   ``On each continent there is a town called Rome.{''} (true)) or
   emotional (delusion-relevant; e.g., ``The German federal police uses
   approximately 3000 cameras for the purpose of video-based
   face-detection.{''} (not true)) topics were. presented as statements,
   which were either correct or incorrect. After one week, subjects were
   requested to take part in the second and final survey. Here, previously
   presented as well as novel statements had to be appraised according to
   their truth.
   Results: As expected, an overall truth effect was found: statements that
   were repeated achieved higher subjective truth ratings than novel
   statements. Patients high on positive symptoms showed an excessive truth
   effect for emotional (delusion-relevant) items. The positive syndrome
   was correlated with the emotional truth effect in both healthy and
   schizophrenia participants.
   Limitations: The sample was recruited via online forums and had probable
   but not externally validated diagnoses of schizophrenia. No psychiatric
   control group was tested.
   Discussion: The truth effect for emotional items appears to be
   exaggerated in patients high on positive symptoms, which may play a role
   in delusion formation and maintenance. Several limitations of the study
   however render our conclusions preliminary. As Patients with
   schizophrenia often dwell on and ruminate over selective and distorted
   pieces of information (e.g.. conspiracy theories), the subjective
   authenticity of this information may be further elevated by means of the
   truth effect. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Knowable and the Unknowable in Ethnographic Encounters: A Case of
   Sorcery, Rumor, and Gossip among Tuareg in Northern Niger},
Journal = {SLOVENSKY NARODOPIS-SLOVAK ETHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3},
Pages = {392-410},
Abstract = {This article explores issues of knowledge production, its limits, and
   uncertainty and suspicion in ethnographic field research through the
   lens of what anthropologists conventionally call ``sorcery{''} beliefs
   and practices involving a love target, its treatment, and its aftermath
   of ``shapeshifting{''}, occurring in the social context of gossip,
   rumor, and suspicion among the Tuareg, sometimes called Kel Tamajaq
   after their language, in Niger, West Africa. Sorcery, I show, provides a
   useful lens for exploring how gossip and rumor can reveal social
   critiques and ways in which a crisis is handled. In these processes,
   matters of ``truth{''} and ``ignorance{''} are complex, thereby allowing
   scope for broader discussion of ontology. The focus is on an unexpected,
   serendipitous field encounter with sorcery similar, though not identical
   to the re-directing of power of Islamic objects, words, and writing in
   some other African Muslim communities, with emotions awakened and then
   cast away in a puzzling outcome. The setting of the sorcery incident and
   rumors surrounding it is a town in northern Niger, in a household
   compound where this anthropologist stumbled by chance during longterm
   field research, and was also drawn into treatment for this alleged
   sorcery. Many Tuareg, who are Muslim, semi-nomadic, and traditionally
   ranked, have experienced crises and social upheavals: these include
   droughts, locust-invasions, colonial and post-colonial political
   violence, religious debates, coerced settling of nomads in oases and
   towns, labor migration, refugee flight, and health-care inequities. I
   ask, in the context of sorcery, how do Tuareg make sense of these crises
   in their society through gossip and rumor? The analysis explores how far
   and in what ways sorcery and responses to it, like conspiracy theories,
   allow the creation of multiple narratives about political tensions. More
   broadly, how does the ethnographer make sense of ontological
   uncertainty? This analysis is inspired by, but also hopefully builds on
   approaches to ontological ambiguity and uncertainty and approaches to
   the role of gossip and rumor in reviewing ``reality{''} from different
   sense modalities and philosophical assumptions. The challenge here is to
   interpret events and avoid, or at least minimize imposing the observer's
   own concepts of ``truth{''} onto endogenous knowledge and its local
   expressions.},

Title = {School and University in Soviet Cinema of ``Perestroika{''} (1986-1991)},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {82-96},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Films of the ``perestroika{''} period (1986-1991) related to
   school/university theme showed that: - the educational / upbringing
   process has lost the previous strict storylines and in many respects has
   lost its communist landmarks;
   - both school and university have acute problem areas (crisis,
   disappointment and fatigue, professional ``burning out{''} of teachers,
   stagnation, hypocrisy, lies, bureaucracy and authoritarianism, pragmatic
   cynicism of students, teenage cruelty, underage sexual activity, etc.);
   - the activity of a schoolchild / student again became more directed
   toward the outside world than to the inner world;
   - appropriate distance in the teacher-student relationship has become
   more fragile (familiarity, sexual relation, or its provocation); in the
   films Work on Mistakes (1988) and Asthenic Syndrome (1989), male
   teachers even fight with high school students in class or in the school
   corridor; - the prestige of the pedagogical profession in the eyes of
   students and the public has fallen even lower; in accordance with the
   real state of affairs, female teachers' images (often lonely, unsettled)
   came to the forefront;
   - the main conflicts of plots were built on the opposition of
   non-ordinary teachers and students with stagnation, bureaucracy,
   mediocre bosses / colleagues / peers.
   In fact, one can probably assume that the exposing ``black series{''} of
   the perestroika cinema (where the youth theme was one of the most
   prominent ones) served a kind of ``mobilizing purpose{''}, only at the
   time it was not the orientation of ``Soviet power elites in the renewal
   of the tools which they embodied the communist project with{''}.
   Conversely, a Western-oriented part of the Soviet ruling elite used
   ``uncensored{''} cinematography as one of the levers for the gradual
   liquidation of socialism. On the other hand, it is possible not to
   attach special importance to this ``conspiracy{''} assumption, believing
   that Soviet cinematographers spontaneously walked in the wake of
   political and socio-cultural changes of the ``perestroika{''} era. After
   all, we should not forget that by the end of the 1980s a paradoxical
   situation arose in the USSR when the state continued to finance film
   production, but in the actual absence of censorship, filmmakers could
   produce all that they wanted, practically ignoring the opinion of the
   leading bodies of the CPSU and the government.},

Title = {NORTH-KOREA NUCLEAR OPTION - OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTIONS ON THE RECENT
   NPT CRISIS},
Journal = {KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {99-118},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {In March 1993 the North Korean government announced its intention to
   withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
   Pyongyang's motives have been the subject of much speculation, but could
   be explained by one of four possible interpretations. The `'conspiracy
   thesis'' argues that the North Koreans decided to withdraw from the NPT
   when International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections threatened to
   expose their clandestine program of nuclear weapons development. The
   `'frustration'' theory says that the decision was in direct retaliation
   for international community's failure to give the economic and political
   rewards promised North Korea when it agreed to give up its nuclear
   weapons option and accept IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities.
   The `'Israeli approach'' is predicated on the assumption that North's
   withdrawal from the NPT is intended to prevent the international
   community from discovering that Pyongyang was not developing nuclear
   weapons, or alternatively, that they had encountered technical setbacks
   in their nuclear research and development program. Finally is the
   `'embarrassment'' interpretation, speculating that Pyongyang
   inadvertently provided the IAEA with incorrect data on its plutonium
   holdings and now wishes to avoid the dishonor and humiliation of being
   publicly found out.
   If Pyongyang is absolutely intent on building nuclear weapons, the issue
   is unlikely to be resolved satisfactorily irrespective of what the
   international community offers in return. If, as seems more likely, the
   North Koreans are using the nuclear weapons issue in a last ditch
   attempt to achieve nonnuclear objectives, the issue will likely be
   resolved to everyone's mutual satisfaction but only after long and
   difficult negotiations. The objective of the international community
   during these objectives must be: to ensure that North Korea remains a
   member of the NPT, to convince North Korea to open suspect nuclear waste
   sites to IAEA inspections, and to have North Korea satisfactorily
   explain the apparent inconsistencies between its declared plutonium
   holdings to the IAEA and the IAEA findings on the matter. In return the
   international community will have to satisfy legitimate concerns and
   expectations raised in Pyongyang. There is much to be gained and little
   to be lost from such a conciliatory approach at this time.},

Journal = {ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Number = {2},
Pages = {21-50},
Abstract = {The paper analyzes the sources of information on the direct contact of
   the Emperor Frederick II with the Mongols before the attack of the
   latter on Europe, the persistent rumors of his collusion with the
   invaders, who came to blow mainly to the enemies of Frederick, the
   refusal of the Emperor of an armed clash with the Tatars, the refusal to
   participate in the Crusade prepared by the German prelates against the
   Tatars, but instead - a withdrawal of the imperial troops in Italy and
   the siege of Rome in order to force the pope to recognize the supremacy
   of the Emperor, the sudden retreat of the Tartars themselves from the
   German border and the abandonment of the original plans for the conquest
   of Germany, unexpected counteraction against Frederick of the German
   prelates who had been previously loyal to the Emperor and who accused
   him of a serious crime against the Church and the whole of Christianity.
   The author concludes that the Emperor Frederick and the leaders of the
   Western Mongol campaign were associated with secret mutual obligations.
   Many of his contemporaries were aware of the Emperor's secret contacts
   with the Tartars (Albert von Beheim, Matthew Paris, and others.). The
   author analyzes the information and is trying to separate the elements
   of political propaganda from the established facts. The Emperor's
   conspiracy with the Tatar leaders is indicated both by direct evidence
   and numerous indirect information analyzed in the article. On the one
   hand, the Emperor did everything possible to avoid a direct military
   confrontation with the Tatars and disrupt plans of his supporters in
   Germany to combat the invaders. On the other hand, the Tatar impact in
   Europe fell entirely on the Frederick's enemies who took the side of the
   pope in the latter's conflict with Emperor. As a result of the Tatar
   invasion of Europe position of the Emperor in his confrontation with the
   Roman church greatly strengthened. This change in the balance of power
   obviously angered the church prelates and the subsequent rebellion of
   the German Bishops against Frederick provoked long civil war in Germany.},

Title = {Early Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Immunization Services in Nigeria},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: By 11 March 2022, there were 450,229,635 coronavirus disease
   (COVID-19) cases and 6,019,085 deaths globally, with Nigeria reporting
   254,637 cases and 3142 deaths. One of the essential healthcare services
   that have been impacted by the pandemic is routine childhood
   immunization. According to the 2018 National Demographic and Health
   Survey, only 31\% of children aged 12-23 months were fully vaccinated in
   Nigeria, and 19\% of eligible children in the country had not received
   any vaccination. A further decline in coverage due to the pandemic can
   significantly increase the risk of vaccine-preventable-disease outbreaks
   among children in Nigeria. To mitigate such an occurrence, it is
   imperative to urgently identify how the pandemic and the response
   strategies have affected vaccination services, hence, the goal of the
   study. Methods: The research method was qualitative, including in-depth
   interviews of healthcare workers and focus group discussions (FGDs) with
   caregivers of children aged 0-23 months. We selected one state from each
   of the three zones of Nigeria: northern, central, and southern. Within
   each state, 10 local government areas and 20 healthcare facilities were
   purposively selected. In each facility, 10 healthcare workers were
   invited for interviews. Overall, 517 healthcare workers were
   interviewed. For the focus group discussion, 30 communities were
   selected. Within each selected community, six consenting caregivers were
   included. Overall, 180 caregivers participated. The data were analyzed
   using thematic inductive content analysis. Results: Three significant
   impacts that were observed are: difficulties in accessibility to
   immunization services, declining immunization demand and uptake among
   caregivers due to varying factors, and erosion of vaccine confidence
   among both caregivers and healthcare workers. Movement restriction and
   lockdown had numerous major impacts, such as decreased general
   healthcare service delivery, increased transportation costs, fewer
   engagements that promote vaccine uptake, and cessation of mobile
   vaccination campaigns that target hard-to-reach communities. Moreover,
   misinformation, conspiracy beliefs about the pandemic and COVID-19
   vaccines, and risk perception negatively influenced general vaccine
   confidence. Conclusion: The results of this early impact study show that
   immunization was directly affected by the pandemic and provide insights
   into areas where interventions are needed for recovery.},

Title = {An Analysis of French-Language Tweets About COVID-19 Vaccines:
   Supervised Learning Approach},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, disinformation, fake
   news, and conspiracy theories spread through many parts of society.
   However, the disinformation spreading through social media is, according
   to the literature, one of the causes of increased COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy. In this context, the analysis of social media posts is
   particularly important, but the large amount of data exchanged on social
   media platforms requires specific methods. This is why machine learning
   and natural language processing models are increasingly applied to
   social media data. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the
   capability of the CamemBERT French-language model to faithfully predict
   the elaborated categories, with the knowledge that tweets about
   vaccination are often ambiguous, sarcastic, or irrelevant to the studied
   topic. Methods: A total of 901,908 unique French-language tweets related
   to vaccination published between July 12, 2021, and August 11, 2021,
   were extracted using Twitter???s application programming interface
   (version 2; Twitter Inc). Approximately 2000 randomly selected tweets
   were labeled with 2 types of categorizations: (1) arguments for (pros)
   or against (cons) vaccination (health measures included) and (2) type of
   content (scientific, political, social, or vaccination status). The
   CamemBERT model was fine-tuned and tested for the classification of
   French-language tweets. The model???s performance was assessed by
   computing the F1-score, and confusion matrices were obtained. Results:
   The accuracy of the applied machine learning reached up to 70.6\% for
   the first classification (pro and con tweets) and up to 90\% for the
   second classification (scientific and political tweets). Furthermore, a
   tweet was 1.86 times more likely to be incorrectly classified by the
   model if it contained fewer than 170 characters (odds ratio 1.86; 95\%
   CI 1.20-2.86). Conclusions: The accuracy of the model is affected by the
   classification chosen and the topic of the message examined. When the
   vaccine debate is jostled by contested political decisions, tweet
   content becomes so heterogeneous that the accuracy of the model drops
   for less differentiated classes. However, our tests showed that it is
   possible to improve the accuracy by selecting tweets using a new method
   based on tweet length.},

Abstract = {The subject. The paper concentrates on problem of development
   constitutional nihilism in Russia.
   The purpose of the article is confirmation or confutation of the
   hypothesis that we can distinguish four legal periods in the development
   of constitutional nihilism in Russia, taking into account its criteria.
   The methodology of study includes historical analysis of legal
   literature and formal legal analysis of normative legal acts.
   The main results and scope of their application. The concept of
   constitutional nihilism is debatable. There is no single definition of
   constitutional nihilism. The paper analysis main definitions Russian and
   foreign scientists and offer new integrating definition. The criteria of
   constitutional nihilism are very similar to criteria of legal nihilism
   but there are several exceptions..he following grounds for classifying
   constitutional nihilism are most informative: level of prevalence; the
   nature of the external manifestation; the nature of denial; orientation
   of the nihilistic attitude, subjects of negation. At various stages of
   Russia's development, the main social groups among which constitutional
   nihilism was widespread were senior civil servants, high rank military
   officials and even presidents and even Emperor's family. The object of
   constitutional nihilism is the denial and non-fulfillment of
   constitutional norms, non- participation in the implementation of
   constitutional relations. Constitutional nihilism in Russia is closely
   intertwined with constitutional upheaval, conspiracy, and rebellion.
   Constitutional nihilism is dangerous not only because it changes the
   structure of the state, but also because of the surge of legal nihilism
   among the population of the country. The sources of constitutional
   nihilism are periods of upheaval and other negative events that push the
   highest echelons of power to deliberately violate the laws.
   Conclusions. There are four main period of constitutional nihilism in
   Russia. The table compiled by the author contains six historical periods
   and four legal periods. Each of them is based on criteria of
   constitutional nihilism. The next period of constitutional nihilism can
   be calculated, because most often it occurs after large-scale social
   upheavals, but with the arrival of a strong and influential leader of
   the country, constitutional nihilism disappears for a while.},

Abstract = {I review a recent analysis presented in F. Jegerlehner, Acta Phys. Pol.
   B 45, 1167 (2014); arXiv: 1305. 6652 {[}hep-ph], Acta Phys. Pol. B45,
   1215 (2014). After the discovery of the Higgs particle the most relevant
   structures of the SM have been verified and for the first time we know
   all parameters of the SM within remarkable accuracy. Together with
   recent calculations of the SM renormalization group coefficients up to
   three loops, we can safely extrapolate running couplings high up in
   energy. Assuming that the SM is a low energy effective theory of a
   cutoff theory residing at the Planck scale, we are able to calculate the
   effective bare parameters of the underlying cutoff system. It turns out
   that the effective bare mass term changes sign not far below the Planck
   scale, which means that in the early universe the SM was in the
   symmetric phase. The sign-flip, which is a result of a conspiracy
   between the SM couplings and their screening/antiscreening behavior,
   triggers the Higgs mechanism. Above the Higgs phase transition the bare
   mass term in the Higgs potential must have had a large positive value,
   enhanced by the quadratic divergence of the bare Higgs mass. Likewise
   the quartically enhanced positive vacuum energy density is present in
   the symmetric phase. The Higgs system thus provides the large dark
   energy density in the early universe, which triggers slow-roll
   inflation, i.e. the SM Higgs is the inflaton scalar field. Reheating is
   dominated by the decay of the heavy Higgses into (in the symmetric
   phase) massless top/anti-top quark pairs. The Higgs mechanism stops
   inflation and the subsequent electroweak phase transition provides the
   masses to the SM particles in proportion to their coupling strength. The
   previously most abundantly produced particles are now the heaviest and
   decay into the lighter ones, by cascading down the CKM-element matrix
   from top and bottom to normal matter. Baryon-number B violating
   interactions are naturally provided by Weinberg's set of close-by
   dimension 6 four-fermion effective interactions. Since matter is
   produced originating from the primordial heavy Higgs fields via C and CF
   violating decays we have actually a new scenario which possibly could
   explain the baryon-asymmetry essentially in terms of SM physics.},

Abstract = {Scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry of the dwarf galaxy UGC 2259 in the
   {[}OIII] lambda-5007 angstrom line is presented. The velocities of
   twenty {[}OIII] emission regions belonging to the galaxy were measured.
   From two separate data cubes, we obtained the rotation curve of the
   galaxy in the radial range 0.25 - 2.5 kpc. The velocity field is regular
   and does not show large deviations from pure circular motion. The new
   high spatial resolution data of the central part of the galaxy, together
   with previous HI measurements of the outer parts, are used to analyse
   the detailed mass distribution in the system. A disk model, with mass
   following the radial luminosity profile, can not produce the observed
   rotation curve.
   A satisfactory fit is obtained by adding a dark halo component. At the
   Holmberg radius, the amount of dark matter in UGC 2259 then would be
   between 0.7 and 0.8 times the luminous mass in the disk. This value is
   in the range of the dark-to-luminous mass ratios in brighter galaxies.
   The mass-to-light ratio obtained for the disk is 5.6-5.7.
   An alternative two component mass model is presented, without a halo,
   but containing two separate disk components, one conforming the stellar
   distribution, the second meant to represent the distribution of visual
   light obscuring material. A satisfactory fit to the observed rotation
   curve has been obtained straightforwardly, with both the inter-relation
   between the two components and the resulting extinction properties in
   agreement with recent constraints, as obtained from the analysis of the
   optical properties of ESO-LV disks (Valentijn 1990a,b). As an example,
   we also present a similar two-disk fit to the Sc galaxy NGC 3198. The
   evidence for opaque disks, also in dwarf Sc's and the avoidance of the
   `'disk-halo conspiracy'', seem to favour the two-disk solution over the
   disk-halo solution.
   We also determine the size distribution of the HII regions in UGC 2259
   and obtained a scale diameter of 26 pc in agreement with the value
   expected for low luminosity spiral galaxies.},

Abstract = {The world, as a global village, is currently taking part in a real-time
   public health, medical, socio-cultural, and economic experiment on how
   best to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Extraordinary times demand
   extraordinary measures. Depending on the time from the outbreak,
   strategies have ranged from minimal intervention to mitigation by
   quarantine for high-risk groups (elderly with chronic illnesses) to
   containment and lockdown. Adherence to such restrictions have depended
   on the individual and national psyche and culture. One can understand
   and forgive governments for being over-cautious, but not for being
   ill-prepared. It seems that Singapore after SARS (2003) and South Korea
   after MERS (2015) learnt from their experiences and have fared
   relatively well with minimal disruption to daily routines. Coping with
   the challenge of COVID-19 is an urgent global task. We use the Sociotype
   ecological framework to analyze different coping responses at three
   levels: Context (government and leadership, social context, health
   services, and media); Relationships; and the Individual. We describe the
   many negative outcomes (e.g. mortality {[}obviously], unemployment,
   economic damage, food insecurity, threat to democracy, claustrophobia)
   and the positive ones (e.g. new, remote teaching, working, and medical
   routines; social bonding and solidarity; redefining existential values
   and priorities) of this surreal situation, which is still evolving. We
   highlight the importance of humor in stress reduction. Regular and
   reliable communication to the public has to be improved, acknowledging
   incomplete data, and learning to deal with fake news, misinformation,
   and conspiracy theories. Excess mortality is the preferred statistic to
   follow and compare outcomes. When the health risks are over, the
   economic recovery responses will vary according to the financial state
   of countries. If world order is to be reshaped, then a massive economic
   aid plan should be launched by the rich countries-akin to the Marshall
   plan after the Second World War. It should be led preferably by the USA
   and China. The results of the tradeoffs between health and economic
   lockdowns will only become apparent in the months to come. The
   experiences and lessons learned from this emergency should be used as a
   rehearsal for the next epi-/pandemic, which will surely take place in
   the foreseeable future.},

Title = {The Navigation's Beginning on Izhevsk Pond on the Meeting's Journals of
   the Economic Committee of Izhevsk Plants in 1892-1900},

Abstract = {Izhevsk pond in the XIX - first half of the twentieth centuries was an
   important transport artery for the operation of Izhevsk plants,
   primarily for the connection of the plant with Volozhka and Koltoma. To
   reduce the cost and speed up the traffic at the end of the XIX century
   the first steamboats appeared on Izhevsk pond.
   On the basis of the meeting's journals of the Economic Committee of
   Izhevsk Plants (the supreme center of economic management of plants) in
   1892-1900, the reconstruction of the navigation history of Izhevsk pond
   in the last decade of the 19th century is carried out It's shown that
   initially having no experience in river traffic management, the
   administration of Izhevsk plants gradually find the most optimal ways of
   managing. The coastal infrastructure is expanding, a network of marinas
   is being created at key points of the pond (Volozhka, Koltoma, plant's
   dam, etc.). By the end of the 1890 -s the Economic Committee received
   enough experience to recognize the preliminary conspiracy of firewood
   contractors for the plant at inflated prices. It finds the courage to
   abandon traditional contractors (Porsev and Bodalev) in favor of the new
   (Andreev).
   Appears and experience in the operation of the plant's steamer
   ``Izh{''}. So, if initially the Economic Committee delves into all the
   details of hiring a crew, then in 1897 it transfers the functions of
   selecting half of the crew to the contractor, and after successfully
   navigating, and completely trusts the selection of the crew. In this
   case, the plants compensate for the costs of maintaining the crew. There
   are reserves to reduce the repair and construction of new factory
   barges.
   The key dates in the history of the plant's steamer ``Izh{''}, which,
   judging by the documentation of Izhevsk plants, were built according to
   the project of the plant's steamer of the Votkinsk plant ``Sharkan{''},
   are defined. An analysis of the work done during traditional repairs of
   the plant's steamer shows that, along with operational damages, there
   are signs of poor quality construction and even obvious factory defects
   (through fistulas in the body of the steam engine, patches in the
   boiler, etc.).},

Title = {The smallest interacting universe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2023},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {We study a mechanism by which the most basic structures of quantum
   physics can emerge from the most meager of starting points, a Hilbert
   space, lacking any preassigned structure such as a tensor decomposition,
   and a loss function. In a simple toy model of the universe, we
   hypothesize a fundamental loss functional for the combined Hamiltonian
   and quantum state, and then minimize this loss functional by gradient
   descent. We find that this minimization gives rise to a co-emergence of
   locality, i.e. a tensor product structure simultaneously respected by
   both the Hamiltonian and the state, suggesting that locality can emerge
   by a process analogous to spontaneous symmetry breaking. We discuss the
   relevance of this program to the arrow of time problem.
   In our toy model, we interpret the emergence of a tensor factorization
   as the appearance of individual degrees of freedom within a previously
   undifferentiated (raw) Hilbert space. Earlier work {[}5, 6] looked at
   the emergence of locality in Hamiltonians only, and in that context
   found strong numerical confirmation of the hypothesis that raw Hilbert
   spaces of dim = n are unstable and prefer to settle on tensor
   factorization when n is not prime, expressing, for example, n = pq, and
   in {[}6] even primes were seen to ``factor{''} after first shedding a
   small summand, e.g. 7 = 1 + 2 center dot 3. This was found in the
   context of a rather general potential functional F on the space of
   metrics \{g(ij)\} on su(n), the Lie algebra of symmetries. This
   emergence of qunits through operator-level spontaneous symmetry breaking
   (SSB) may help us understand why the world seems to consist of myriad
   interacting degrees of freedom. But understanding why the universe has
   an initial Hamiltonian H-0 with a many-body structure is of limited
   conceptual value unless the initial state, |psi(0)>, is also structured
   by this tensor decomposition. Here we adapt F to become a functional on
   \{g, |psi(0)>\} = (metrics) x (initial states), and find SSB now
   produces a conspiracy between g and |psi(0)), where they simultaneously
   attain low entropy by jointly settling on the same qubit decomposition.
   Extreme scaling of the computational problem has confined us to studying
   C-4 breaking to C-2 circle times C-2 and C-8 breaking to C-2 circle
   times C-4 or C-2 circle times C-2 circle times C-2.},

Title = {The importance of interdisciplinarity to deal with the complexity of the
   radicalization of a young person},
Journal = {ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {177},
Number = {7},
Pages = {663-674},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives, material and method. - This article offers a qualitative
   analysis of the radicalization of Hamza, 15 years old, supported by the
   Prevention Center against Sectarian Drift related to Islam (CPDSI) after
   several attempts to leave the country and to prepare an attack in
   France. The premise of the CPDSI's multidisciplinary team relies on the
   postulate that the reason for the young person's commitment has to be
   retrieved to help him or her disengage. The specificity of the CPDSI
   relied on the access to the implicit discourse of the young people who
   were treated in charge. Thus, it allowed an access to the ideals the
   recruiters offer to youngster during the process of radicalization
   (elements that they were not necessarily aware of at the time but they
   gradually raised awareness throughout their follow-up), from the study
   of recruiters' conversations, the arguments they used, the videos they
   exchanged, but also the analysis of their life course, of their ideals
   before their radicalization, of the traumatic experiences that they have
   through and the interviews with their relatives. In other words, we
   tried to collect data on what basically conditioned the commitment of
   the young people we followed, starting from the premise that to be
   authoritative, a speech has to make sense'. It is in particular from the
   discrepancy between the explicit discourse formulated by ``jihadist{''}
   recruiters and the implicit motivations of young recruits that the CPDSI
   was able to build its method of disengagement.
   Results. - The study shows that the whole process of radicalization is
   the result of the interaction of 3 cumulative approaches: emotional (the
   approach of ISIS is a source of anxiety, based notably on the
   exacerbation of national dysfunctions, conspiracy theories and
   decontextualized Qur'anic verses), relational (the group becomes a
   substituted family where the bonds are fusional and protective; Hamza
   distanced himself from his kinship system to regenerate himself through
   a new imaginary, sacred and fantasized filiation) and
   cognitivo-ideological (the discourse presents the application of the
   divine law to obtain a better self and a better world). The contemporary
   ``jihadist{''} discourse can be distinguished by its capacity to
   individualize or to personalize its offers, proposing, for example,
   through the Internet, diversified patterns of engagement that resonate
   with the different psychological, political and social profiles of young
   people: what Hamza seems to have found within the ``jihadist{''} group
   is a quick and effective way to answer a problem of unresolved mourning
   of his grandfather who symbolized his history and his memory. Here is a
   transition between his personal ill-being linked to the experience of
   mourning and adherence to a collective ideology related to Islam.
   Indeed, Hamza is convinced that his ill being, even brief, will be
   settled by his adherence to the proposed ideology, the only one able to
   give meaning to what he just lived and allow him to live with. These
   approaches bring a cognitive change in Hamza: he redefines himself,
   redefines others, and redefines his vision of the world. Several
   transformations of the psychic state of Hamza take place. The vision of
   the binary world transmitted by the group ``jihadist{''} reassures Hamza
   because it allows him to categorize his environment, which, simply said,
   is the place of ``good{''} and ``bad guys{''}. Violent radical ideology
   needs to stagger its values to build a human hierarchy, which will then
   allow a shift to lived violence as the only way out. We see how, to make
   himself useful, Hamza no longer has to help the widow and the orphan but
   has to kill all those who do not save with him the widow and the orphan.
   This young man goes from a massive fear of death to a death wish. The
   perpetrator/victim status is reversed: members of the ``jihadist{''}
   group are considered by Hamza to be the victims of the global conspiracy
   against Islam and the persecution against Muslims. Conversely, he
   considers the victims of Daesh abuses responsible for the persecution of
   his group. The fact that Hamza is no longer able to be moved by the
   violent videos, nor to feel empathy for the victims of the attacks
   illustrates that this young man is doubly dehumanized. He himself no
   longer feels anything and he no longer considers ``the others{''}, his
   future victims, as human beings in their own right. This step allows us
   to understand the difference between the implicit (search for
   compensatory solution to calm his anxiety) and the explicit (binary
   speech related to the ideology of Daesh).
   Conclusions. - The analysis of the follow-up of this young person shows
   the necessity of the interdisciplinarity of professionals in order to
   mirror the ``jihadist{''} discourse to untie what it did, without
   reducing the young radicalized to a status (author or victim), in a
   specific field (psychological, social, political or religious) and in a
   given dimension (emotional, relational or ideological) as this would
   deny the existence of other possibilities. Faced with the rigidity of
   the radical ``jihadist{''} thinking, the challenge for professionals is
   to test their flexibility of mind to optimize their practice of
   follow-ups. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Factors mediating seasonal and influenza A (H1N1) vaccine acceptance

Abstract = {Objective: We examined the acceptability of the influenza A (H1N1) and
   seasonal vaccinations immediately following government manufacture
   approval to gauge potential product uptake in minority communities. We
   studied correlates of vaccine acceptance including attitudes, beliefs,
   perceptions, and influenza immunization experiences, and sought to
   identify communication approaches to increase influenza vaccine coverage
   in community settings.
   Methods: Adults >= 18 years participated in a cross-sectional survey
   from September through December 2009. Venue-based sampling was used to
   recruit participants of racial and ethnic minorities.
   Results: The sample (N=503) included mostly lower income (81.9\%, n=412)
   participants and African Americans (79.3\%, n=399). Respondents
   expressed greater acceptability of the H1N1 vaccination compared to
   seasonal flu immunization (t=2.86, p=0.005) although H1N1 vaccine
   acceptability was moderately low (38\%, n=191). Factors associated with
   acceptance of the H1N1 vaccine included positive attitudes about
   immunizations {[}OR=0.23, CI (0.16, 0.33)], community perceptions of
   H1N1 {[}OR=2.15, CI (1.57, 2.95)], and having had a flu shot in the past
   5 years {[}OR=2.50, CI (1.52, 4.10). The factors associated with
   acceptance of the seasonal flu vaccine included positive attitudes about
   immunization {[}OR=0.43, CI (0.32, 0.59)], community perceptions of H1N1
   {[}OR=1.53, CI (1.16, 2.01)], and having had the flu shot in the past 5
   years {[}OR=3.53, CI (2.16, 5.78)]. Participants were most likely to be
   influenced to take a flu shot by physicians {[}OR=1.94, CI (1.31,
   2.86)]. Persons who obtained influenza vaccinations indicated that
   Facebook (chi(2)=11.7, p=0.02) and Twitter (chi(2)=18.1, p = 0.001)
   could be useful vaccine communication channels and that churches
   (chi(2)=21.5, p<0.001) and grocery stores (chi(2)=21.5, p<0.001) would
   be effective ``flu shot stops{''} in their communities.
   Conclusions: In this population, positive vaccine attitudes and
   community perceptions, along with previous flu vaccination, were
   associated with H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccine acceptance.
   Increased immunization coverage in this community may be achieved
   through physician communication to dispel vaccine conspiracy beliefs and
   discussion about vaccine protection via social media and in other
   community venues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Characterizing the COVID-19 Infodemic on Chinese Social Media:
   Exploratory Study},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},

Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 infodemic has been disseminating rapidly on
   social media and posing a significant threat to people's health and
   governance systems.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate and analyze posts related to
   COVID-19 misinformation on major Chinese social media platforms in order
   to characterize the COVID-19 infodemic.
   Methods: We collected posts related to COVID-19 misinformation published
   on major Chinese social media platforms from January 20 to May 28, 2020,
   by using PythonToolkit. We used content analysis to identify the
   quantity and source of prevalent posts and topic modeling to cluster
   themes related to the COVID-19 infodemic. Furthermore, we explored the
   quantity, sources, and theme characteristics of the COVID-19 infodemic
   over time.
   Results: The daily number of social media posts related to the COVID-19
   infodemic was positively correlated with the daily number of newly
   confirmed (r=0.672, P<.01) and newly suspected (r=0.497, P<.01) COVID-19
   cases. The COVID-19 infodemic showed a characteristic of gradual
   progress, which can be divided into 5 stages: incubation, outbreak,
   stalemate, control, and recovery. The sources of the COVID-19 infodemic
   can be divided into 5 types: chat platforms (1100/2745, 40.07\%),
   video-sharing platforms (642/2745, 23.39\%), news-sharing platforms
   (607/2745, 22.11\%), health care platforms (239/2745, 8.71\%), and Q\&A
   platforms (157/2745, 5.72\%), which slightly differed at each stage. The
   themes related to the COVID-19 infodemic were clustered into 8
   categories: ``conspiracy theories{''} (648/2745, 23.61\%), ``government
   response{''} (544/2745, 19.82\%), ``prevention action{''} (411/2745,
   14.97\%), ``new cases{''} (365/2745, 13.30\%), ``transmission routes{''}
   (244/2745, 8.89\%), ``origin and nomenclature{''} (228/2745, 8.30\%),
   ``vaccines and medicines{''} (154/2745, 5.61\%), and ``symptoms and
   detection{''} (151/2745, 5.50\%), which were prominently diverse at
   different stages. Additionally, the COVID-19 infodemic showed the
   characteristic of repeated fluctuations.
   Conclusions: Our study found that the COVID-19 infodemic on Chinese
   social media was characterized by gradual progress, videoization, and
   repeated fluctuations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the
   COVID-19 infodemic is paralleled to the propagation of the COVID-19
   epidemic. We have tracked the COVID-19 infodemic across Chinese social
   media, providing critical new insights into the characteristics of the
   infodemic and pointing out opportunities for preventing and controlling
   the COVID-19 infodemic.},

Title = {Critique and postcritique in the humanities: Displacement of the

Abstract = {In recent decades the topic of critique has been the subject of lively
   debate in philosophy and the humanities. At the centre of these debates
   is the final deadlock that critique is experiencing and the means of
   displacing or renewing its paradigm. A `postcritical turn' has become an
   umbrella term for the content and focus of efforts to renew critique.
   The critical tradition associated with deconstructive, psychoanalytic,
   Marxist, feminist practices has been questioned because of its negative,
   ``suspicious{''} and symptomatic way of interpreting objects, texts and
   other cultural works. The common denominator of this tradition is a
   ``hermeneutics of suspicion{''}, a focus on exposing and revealing the
   untold and hidden. Postcritique advocates an alternative model of
   interpretation, encouraging critics to move from the ideal of exposing
   hidden meanings, ideological implication and repressed content, to a
   spirit of positivity, care and protection of explicit text content,
   aesthetic properties and affective capacities of objects. The article
   reveals the principles, content, and controversial points of the
   post-critical mode of renewal of critique. The contours of critique as
   problematization, designed to go beyond both traditional critique with
   its aspiration for denunciation and the quietist aestheticism of
   postcritique, are presented. Critique as problematization is defined in
   the totality of its three modalities: the historicization of
   self-evident forms of life and subjectivities, discursive and
   non-discursive practices of resistance to the present, and the
   transformation of modes of subjectivation. The rationale of critique as
   problematization is argued as follows. The first part of the article
   discusses the critical position of critique, accompanied by such
   phenomena as suspicion, scepticism and conspiracy thinking,
   naturalization and relativization of facts. The background to the shift
   in the meaning of critique from negativity to positivity is outlined.
   The second part of the article discusses the main principles of
   postcritique: positivity, the shift towards affective engagement with
   the object of study; actualism, the attention to the contemporaneity of
   the object, rather than its reduction to different contexts;
   immanentism, the derivation of a specific way of being from its
   referential links. The third part presents the general contours of
   critique as a problematization designed to go beyond its treatment of
   both negativity and positivity. In conclusion, two necessary
   requirements for a problematizing critique in the present context are
   expressed.},

Title = {Joint Lyman a emitters - quasars reionization constraints},

Abstract = {We present a novel method to investigate c reionization, using joint
   spectral information on high-redshift Lyman a emitters (LAEs) and
   quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). Although LAEs have been proposed as
   reionization probes, their use is hampered by the fact their Lya line is
   damped not only by intergalactic H i but also internally by dust. Our
   method allows us to overcome such degeneracy. First, we carefully
   calibrate a reionization simulation with QSO absorption line
   experiments. Then we identify LAEs ( and equivalent width >20 angstrom)
   in two simulation boxes at z= 5.7 and 6.6 and we build synthetic
   images/spectra of a prototypical LAE. The surface brightness maps show
   the presence of a scattering halo extending up to 150 kpc from the
   galaxye. For each LAE we then select a small box of (10 h-1 Mpc)3 around
   it and derive the optical depth t along three viewing axes. At redshift
   5.7, we find that the Lya transmissivity , almost independent of the
   halo mass. This constancy arises from the conspiracy of two effects: (i)
   the intrinsic Lya line width and (ii) the infall peculiar velocity. At
   higher redshift, z= 6.6, where the transmissivity is instead largely set
   by the local H i abundance and consequently increases with halo mass,
   Mh, from 0.15 to 0.3. Although outflows are present, they are
   efficiently pressure confined by infall in a small region around the
   LAE; hence they only marginally affect transmissivity. Finally, we cast
   line of sight originating from background QSOs passing through
   foreground LAEs at different impact parameters, and compute the quasar
   transmissivity (). At small impact parameters, d < 1 cMpc, a positive
   correlation between and Mh is found at z= 5.7, which tends to become
   less pronounced (i.e. flatter) at larger distances. Quantitatively, a
   roughly 10x increase (from 5 x 10-3 to 6 x 10-2) of is observed in the
   range log Mh= (10.411.6). This correlation becomes even stronger at z=
   6.6. By cross-correlating and , we can obtain a H i density estimate
   unaffected by dust. At z= 5.7, the cross-correlation is relatively weak,
   whereas at z= 6.6 we find a clear positive correlation. We conclude by
   briefly discussing the perspectives for the application of the method to
   existing and forthcoming data.},

Title = {TWO BITES AT THE APPLE: REQUIRING DOUBLE JEOPARDY PROTECTION IN GANG
   CASES},

Abstract = {The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States
   constitution guarantees that a person cannot be punished twice for the
   same offense. This protection is meant, at least in part, to prevent the
   State from getting ``two bites at the apple,{''} or two chances to
   convict and punish a person for a single act. Yet under complex criminal
   statutes, a person who commits a single criminal act may be tried for
   that crime and then tried again for additional crimes - arising out of
   the exact same offense - based on allegations of committing the crime in
   furtherance of a criminal enterprise. In addition to increasing the
   chances of an unjust conviction and unconstitutionally punishing a
   person twice for the same offense, complex criminal statutes put undue
   pressure on criminal Defendants to plead guilty, to crimes they may or
   may not have committed, in order to avoid lifelong sentences. These laws
   primarily target Black and Brown men and contribute to racialized mass
   incarceration.
   This article highlights gang statutes, a form of complex criminal
   liability, which punish alleged gang members for a given crime, then
   further punish those same accused members for committing the same crime
   in furtherance of a gang. This article identifies three double jeopardy
   violations, then offers three distinct suggestions for defense
   attorneys, ethical prosecutors, and judges to right these wrongs. First,
   gang prosecutions violate classic double jeopardy when predicated on a
   single, previously adjudicated criminal offense. Second, gang
   prosecutions violate collateral estoppel where criminal Defendants are
   found not guilty of a substantive criminal act, yet found guilty of the
   same act in furtherance of the gang. Third, multiple punishment double
   jeopardy is violated when Defendants are punished consecutively for a
   gang statute and conspiracy to violate the same gang statute.
   This is the fourth article in a series that argues that gang statutes
   were created, and have operated, to incarcerate poor, young men of
   color-including seasoned gang members, novice gang members, and simply
   accused gang members-under a peculiar set of legal standards that
   violate the plain language of the United States Constitution. To ensure
   criminal Defendants, including gang members, due process of law, gang
   statues must be abolished. Until then, ethical prosecutors should
   refrain from bringing gang charges, and if they do bring gang charges,
   should avoid the constitutional violations described in this series.},

Title = {Changes in Public Response Associated With Various COVID-19 Restrictions
   in Ontario, Canada: Observational Infoveillance Study Using Social Media
   Time Series Data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},

Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Background: News media coverage of antimask protests, COVID-19
   conspiracies, and pandemic politicization has overemphasized extreme
   views but has done little to represent views of the general public.
   Investigating the public's response to various pandemic restrictions can
   provide a more balanced assessment of current views, allowing policy
   makers to craft better public health messages in anticipation of poor
   reactions to controversial restrictions.
   Objective: Using data from social media, this infoveillance study aims
   to understand the changes in public opinion associated with the
   implementation of COVID-19 restrictions (eg, business and school
   closures, regional lockdown differences, and additional public health
   restrictions, such as social distancing and masking).
   Methods: COVID-19-related tweets in Ontario (n=1,150,362) were collected
   based on keywords between March 12 and October 31, 2020. Sentiment
   scores were calculated using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and
   Sentiment Reasoner) algorithm for each tweet to represent its negative
   to positive emotion. Public health restrictions were identified using
   government and news media websites. Dynamic regression models with
   autoregressive integrated moving average errors were used to examine the
   association between public health restrictions and changes in public
   opinion over time (ie, collective attention, aggregate positive
   sentiment, and level of disagreement), controlling for the effects of
   confounders (ie, daily COVID-19 case counts, holidays, and
   COVID-19-related official updates).
   Results: In addition to expected direct effects (eg, business closures
   led to decreased positive sentiment and increased disagreements), the
   impact of restrictions on public opinion was contextually driven. For
   example, the negative sentiment associated with business closures was
   reduced with higher COVID-19 case counts. While school closures and
   other restrictions (eg, masking, social distancing, and travel
   restrictions) generated increased collective attention, they did not
   have an effect on aggregate sentiment or the level of disagreement (ie,
   sentiment polarization). Partial (ie, region-targeted) lockdowns were
   associated with better public response (ie, higher number of tweets with
   net positive sentiment and lower levels of disagreement) compared to
   province-wide lockdowns.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a rapid and
   flexible method of evaluating the public response to pandemic
   restrictions using near real-time social media data. This information
   can help public health practitioners and policy makers anticipate public
   response to future pandemic restrictions and ensure adequate resources
   are dedicated to addressing increases in negative sentiment and levels
   of disagreement in the face of scientifically informed, but
   controversial, restrictions.},

Title = {Biohistorical materials and contemporary privacy concerns-the forensic
   case of King Albert I},
Journal = {FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL-GENETICS},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {The rapid advancement of technology in genomic analysis increasingly
   allows researchers to study human biohistorical materials. Nevertheless,
   little attention has been paid to the privacy of the donor's living
   relatives and the negative impact they might experience from the
   (public) availability of genetic results, even in cases of scientific,
   forensic or historical relevance. This issue has become clear during a
   cold case investigation of a relic attributed to Belgian King and World
   War I-hero Albert I who died, according to the official version, in a
   solo climbing accident in 1934. Authentication of the relic with blood
   stains assigned to the King and collected on the place where his body
   was discovered is recognised as one of the final opportunities to test
   the plausibility of various conspiracy theories on the King's demise.
   While the historical value and current technological developments allow
   the genomic analysis of this relic, publication of genetic data would
   immediately lead to privacy concerns for living descendants and
   relatives of the King, including the Belgian and British royal families,
   even after more than 80 years. Therefore, the authentication study of
   the relic of King Albert I has been a difficult exercise towards
   balancing public research interests and privacy interests. The
   identification of the relic was realised by using a strict genetic
   genealogical approach including Y-chromosome and mitochondrial genome
   comparison with living relatives, thereby limiting the analysis to
   genomic regions relevant for identification. The genetic results
   combined with all available historical elements concerning the relic,
   provide strong evidence that King Albert I was indeed the donor of the
   blood stains, which is in line with the official climbing accident
   hypothesis and contradicts widespread `mise-en-scene' scenarios. Since
   publication of the haploid data of the blood stains has the potential to
   violate the privacy of living relatives, we opted for external and
   independent reviewing of (the quality of) our data and statistical
   interpretation by external forensic experts in haploid markers to
   guarantee the objectivity and scientific accuracy of the identification
   data analysis as well as the privacy of living descendants and
   relatives. Although the cold case investigation provided relevant
   insights into the circumstances surrounding the death of King Albert I,
   it also revealed the insufficient ethical guidance for current genomic
   studies of biohistorical material. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {European women in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century India were
   usually banished from public or political activity by colonial
   patriarchy, but if politics is also enacted in various non-governmental
   arenas, it is evident that the domestic parlor, the kitchen, the
   servants' quarters, and other physical spaces that colonial women
   managed would also become spaces where colonial ideology was constructed
   and modified. This paper explores the construction of a bourgeois
   domestic ideology as an alternative voice within colonialist patriarchy,
   and at the inscription of the subaltern female body as a metonymic text
   of subaltern conspiracy and treachery. A bourgeois ethnographic
   tradition of looking at the subaltern female body finds articulation in
   Aphra Behn's Oroonoko (1688) and in Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's
   (Halsband, 1965) Letters from the Levant (1716-1718). Keeping this
   tradition in mind, this paper will look specifically at the ethnographic
   body criticisms of Mrs. Kindersley, Mrs. Eliza Fay, and Mrs. Mary Martha
   Sherwood. The `'public'' eastern woman appeared in many cultural
   contexts in the east, but in this paper she essentially signifies the
   eastern dancer -- the nautch or tamasha girl whose profession was
   frequently and unhesitatingly associated with sex work, and the Indian
   female domestic servant. The `'private'' woman, on the other hand, was
   the inhabitant of the zenana or the harem (the women's quarters). The
   profession of the dancing girl -- an entertainment enjoyed by English
   and Indian observers -- was interpreted to indicate the dancer's
   diseased and atavistic sexuality. However, while the public and private
   spheres were supposedly demarcated as secret and private in the case of
   the women's residential quarters, and shamelessly and spectacularly
   promiscuous and public in the case of the theatricl performance, in
   reality the narratives suggested a complicity between private and public
   subaltern sexual conduct and inclinations, the only difference in the
   case of the harem or zenana being a greater degree of masculine
   oppression and feminine self-censure. The strip-tease-like gradual
   discarding of the veil in the tamasha or nautch and its middle eastern
   equivalents appeared to be only the fully eroticized expression of the
   languid gestural language in the zenana or harem. Thus, one of the
   monolithic indices this body discourse achieves is a proclamation of the
   universal rampancy of subaltern female sexuality, destroying the
   patriarchally imposed distinction of public and private upon which
   western protofeminism constructed itself.},

Title = {Sadism, <i>Schadenfreude</i>, and Cruelty},
Journal = {FILOZOFSKI VESTNIK},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {155+},
Abstract = {The article starts from the question of where the theses that we are
   ruled by sadists today come from, both in conspiracy theories and in
   explanations of the prevalence of violence and cruelty in modem society.
   The article first highlights some important recent changes in politics,
   economics, and society (the fall of the Berlin Wall; victimisation; the
   crisis of politics and the rise of neoliberalism; the changing dynamics
   of capitalism, which appropriates and valorises affect and favours the
   bizarre; the new social media; the shift of obscenity from the margins
   to the centre; the paradoxes of the ``end of history{''} and historical
   stagnation; the pandemic; the change in the general mood from anxiety to
   nightmare, in which the main problem is the enjoyment of the Other). The
   article then looks at the historical changes in the term ``sadism{''},
   which in the 19th and 20th centuries reduced Sade's work to a clinical
   category, defined the meaning of ``sadism{''} as the pleasure of
   torturing others, and constructed the term ``sadomasochism{''} in Freud,
   the Freudians, and the Frankfurt School. The latter was used to analyse
   Nazism, and was later rightly criticised by Deleuze as something that
   had nothing to do with Sade and Masoch. War propaganda, cliches, and
   other processes play a special role in this process of forming the
   general conception of sadism; they are also responsible for the fact
   that ``sadomasochism{''} as a sexual practice and as a fashion has
   recently become something socially acceptable, although, on the other
   hand, it has played a part in the ``pomification{''} of society and in
   the recent enforcement of extremely violent forms of pornography.
   Notwithstanding all these distortions of sadism and notwithstanding the
   uselessness of sadomasochism in a concrete analysis of the functioning
   of modern social bonds, a certain form of sadism in general, especially
   in the face of all the social and political changes mentioned above
   (trolls, haters), retains its power over society. To analyse this in
   more detail, one must include the ubiquitous but little analysed
   phenomenon of schadenfreude, especially on the part of the public, and
   cruelty as a phenomenon to which society is both distanced and
   fascinated. The third step is to explain what schadenfreude and cruelty
   are and how they relate to l.acan's concept of objet petit a.},

Title = {Evolution of Public Opinion on COVID-19 Vaccination in Japan:
   Large-Scale Twitter Data Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {Background: Vaccines are promising tools to control the spread of
   COVID-19. An effective vaccination campaign requires government policies
   and community engagement, sharing experiences for social support, and
   voicing concerns about vaccine safety and efficiency. The increasing use
   of online social platforms allows us to trace large-scale communication
   and infer public opinion in real time.
   Objective: This study aimed to identify the main themes in COVID-19
   vaccine-related discussions on Twitter in Japan and track how the
   popularity of the tweeted themes evolved during the vaccination
   campaign. Furthermore, we aimed to understand the impact of critical
   social events on the popularity of the themes.
   Methods: We collected more than 100 million vaccine-related tweets
   written in Japanese and posted by 8 million users (approximately 6.4\%
   of the Japanese population) from January 1 to October 31, 2021. We used
   Latent Dirichlet Allocation to perform automated topic modeling of tweet
   text during the vaccination campaign. In addition, we performed an
   interrupted time series regression analysis to evaluate the impact of 4
   critical social events on public opinion.
   Results: We identified 15 topics grouped into the following 4 themes:
   (1) personal issue, (2) breaking news, (3) politics, and (4) conspiracy
   and humor. The evolution of the popularity of themes revealed a shift in
   public opinion, with initial sharing of attention over personal issues
   (individual aspect), collecting information from news (knowledge
   acquisition), and government criticism to focusing on personal issues.
   Our analysis showed that the Tokyo Olympic Games affected public opinion
   more than other critical events but not the course of vaccination.
   Public opinion about politics was significantly affected by various
   social
   Conclusions: This study showed a striking shift in public interest in
   Japan, with users splitting their attention over various themes early in
   the vaccination campaign and then focusing only on personal issues, as
   trust in vaccines and policies increased. An interrupted time series
   regression analysis showed that the vaccination rollout to the general
   population (under 65 years) increased the popularity of tweets about
   practical advice and personal vaccination experience, and the Tokyo
   Olympic Games disrupted public opinion but not the course of the
   vaccination campaign. The methodology developed here allowed us to

Abstract = {Introduction: COVID-19 vaccine uptake has been a major barrier to
   stopping the pandemic in many coun-tries with vaccine access. This
   longitudinal study examined the capability to predict vaccine uptake
   from data collected early in the pandemic before vaccines were
   available.Methods: 493 US respondents completed online surveys both at
   baseline (March 2020) and wave 6 (June 2021), while 390 respondents
   completed baseline and wave 7 (November 2021) surveys. The baseline
   survey assessed trust in sources of COVID-19 information, social norms,
   perceived risk of COVID-19, skep-ticism about the pandemic, prevention
   behaviors, and conspiracy beliefs. Multivariable logistic models
   examined factors associated with the receipt of at least one COVID-19
   vaccine dose at the two follow-ups. Results: In the adjusted model of
   vaccination uptake at wave 6, older age (aOR = 1.02, 95 \%CI =
   1.00-1.04) and greater income (aOR = 1.69, 95 \%CI = 1.04-2.73) was
   associated with positive vaccination status. High trust in state health
   departments and mainstream news outlets at baseline were positively
   associated with vaccination at wave 6, while high trust in the
   Whitehouse (aOR = 0.42, 95 \%CI = 0.24-0.74) and belief that China
   purposely spread the virus (aOR = 0.66, 95 \%CI = 0.46-0.96) at baseline
   reduced the odds of vaccination. In the adjusted model of vaccination
   uptake at wave 7, increased age was associated with positive vaccination
   status, and Black race (compared to white) was associated with negative
   vaccination status. High trust in the CDC and mainstream news outlets at
   baseline were both associated with being vaccinated at wave 7, while
   high trust in the Whitehouse (aOR = 0.24, 95 \%CI = 0.11-0.51) and
   belief that the virus was spread purposefully by China (aOR = 0.60, 95
   \%CI = 0.39-0.93) were negatively associated with
   vaccination.Conclusions: These findings indicated that vaccine uptake
   could be predicted over a year earlier. Trust in specific sources of
   COVID-19 information were strong predictors, suggesting that future
   pandemic pre-paredness plans should include forums for news media,
   public health officials, and diverse political lead-ers to meet and
   develop coherent plans to communicate to the public early in a pandemic
   so that antivaccine attitudes do not flourish and become reinforced.(c)

Title = {Survey upon the Reasons of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance in Romania},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aim: The present study aims to observe the reasons for which the
   participants have chosen to uptake one of the COVID-19 vaccines approved
   in Romania. Thus, it will help us to determine whether the reasons are
   medical in nature, with the respondents' scope to stay healthy, or if
   there are other motivations. High rates of vaccine acceptance are
   essential in the struggle against the COVID-19 pandemic, and trust
   indicators in other inoculations may be vital for the good management of
   the vaccination campaign. Methods: The research consisted in applying an
   online questionnaire in the period January-March 2022 during the fifth
   wave of COVID-19. The individuals in the target group had to comply with
   three conditions: they should be inoculated, at least 18 years of age
   and Romanian residents. The questionnaire was administered to 2297
   people and structured to obtain socio-demographic data, determine
   confidence in mandatory and optional vaccines (rotavirus, hepatitis A,
   meningococcal vaccine, etc.) and extract the reasons why respondents
   chose to be vaccinated. Results: The data extracted from the
   questionnaire reveal a high rate of confidence of participants in the
   vaccines included in the national vaccination scheme (98.6\%) and in the
   optional vaccines other than anti-COVID-19 (97.2\%). Of the respondents,
   23.4\% had at least one positive test for COVID-19. Although the entire
   sample is vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the reasons behind
   the decision to vaccinate are not only medical in nature, thus, 18.3\%
   were motivated by ``protecting their own health/protection against the
   virus{''}, 17\% due to ``fear of the disease{''}, 8.8\% for getting back
   to normal life and ending the pandemic and 8.5\% due to government
   restrictions/vaccination certificate. Conclusions: In our study, we were
   able to validate the research hypothesis that the reasons for vaccine
   acceptance are multiple and not only medical (health protection,
   existing co-morbidities, etc.) and to show that although vaccination has
   been accepted, some participants believe in conspiracy theories,
   including those that try to convince people of the harmfulness of the
   vaccine. In addition, by applying Pearson, Kendall and Spearman
   correlation tests, we observed that indicators showing high confidence

Title = {THE CRISIS OF CONTEMPORARY U.S. AND EU PARTY SYSTEMS: CAUSES AND
   CHARACTERISTICS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2018},
Number = {2},
Pages = {130-149},
Abstract = {The article discusses a number of cases relating to the latest trends in
   the development of the party-political systems in the US and EU
   countries. Article presents analysis of such U.S. movements as ``Occupy
   Wall Street{''}, ``Tea Party{''} and M5S and the Alternative for Germany
   among the European parties. On this basis, the causes of the
   contemporary crisis of the party-political system are analyzed. Among
   the reasons of such a crisis the authors include: the presence of the
   losers from globalization, especially in the lower middle class;
   increased competition from migrants both in terms of access to jobs, and
   in obtaining social benefits; the psychological readiness of a number of
   losers of the middle class to explain the deterioration of their
   socio-economic situation as a consequence of the global ``conspiracy of
   elites{''}; the erosion of the traditional structure of industrial
   society and the consequent degradation of the existing political
   consensus of the center-right and center-left parties that was an engine
   of the globalization; the separation of the globalized elite from the
   middle class of Western countries in the standard of living;
   virtualization of politics and the emergence of new types of mass
   communication, low controlled centrally and allowing various alternative
   forces to easily find contact with a mass audience; tactical errors by
   mainstream forces and traditional media controlled by them in
   counter-attempts to demonize new political movements, which intensifies
   protest moods among the dissatisfied part of the middle class. As a
   result, a broad antiglobalistic identity emerges in Western politics.
   Alternative movements mobilize a significant number of supporters, using
   the image of the enemy: either a migrant or a global capitalist.
   Alternative movements press on their centrist competitors as a result
   of. ``grip from the inside{''} (in the U.S.) or as a result of a
   ``challenging outside{''} (in the EU countries). In the EU countries,
   this trend has led to partial dismantling of party systems, as well as
   the distribution of seats in parliament in favor of representatives of
   new parties. In the U.S., under the influence of the Tea Party Movement
   and the Occupy movement, the moderate wings within the Republicans and
   Democrats were weakened, which was one of the important factors that led
   to the victory of D. Trump in the 2016 presidential election.},

Title = {An Intervention Study for Improve Information and Attitudes Family

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC INFECTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Objective: In our study, it was aimed to provide information training on
   immunization services, vaccine hesitancy and motivational interview
   technique to family health staff working in Edirne. Our research is a
   pre -post type intervention study.Material and Methods: The sample was
   not selected in the study and 90\% of the population was reached (n=
   110). In the study, the partici-pants were trained on the issues related
   to vaccination hesitancy, and the vaccination status of themselves and
   their relatives after the train-ing, their vaccination hesitancy and
   change in the unit where they work, their experience of vaccination
   hesitancy and their knowledge about motivational interviewing, and the
   change in their readiness in the man-agement of vaccination hesitations
   cases were evaluated.Results: Of the participants, 92\% stated that they
   had vaccinated in the adult age, 96\% of those with children and 70\% of
   those who had el-derly relatives, also vaccinated them. Although the
   participants did not increase their participation in the vaccination
   proposal of themselves and their children with the training, the
   participation in the proposal of vaccination of their elderly relatives
   increased. Findings that changed significantly with the applied
   educational intervention; questioning the immunization status,
   participating in the seasonal flu vaccination recommendation,
   participating in the recommendation of the physi-cian and family health
   nurse to follow the vaccination process togeth-er, communication in
   vaccine refusal, necessity, effectiveness, content and reliability, side
   effect profile, and feeling ready to explain conspiracy theories
   increased significantly. Although there was nostatistically signif-icant
   difference with the training, hesitance from immunity campaigns
   decreased, while participation in the need for legal regulation
   increased. Although vaccine hesitancy of the participants did not make a
   statisti-cally significant difference, it decreased to four out of 12
   people after the training (p> 0.05). Of the participants, 45\% stated
   that they encountered vaccine hesitations in the primary health care
   unit. The most common reason stated in the cases encountered is the side
   effect profile.Conclusion: With the training intervention, family health
   workers were informed about vaccination and vaccination hesitations, and
   it was aimed to increase the capacity of immunization services in
   primary care. With the training, family health personnel felt
   significantly more pre-pared to interview vaccine hesitations cases.
   In-service training should be continued in order to maintain the
   effectiveness of the intervention and to enable healthcare professionals
   to manage vaccine refusal or hes-itations more effectively.},

Title = {About some features of the Erzya heroic epos},
Journal = {EZHEGODNIK FINNO-UGORSKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-YEARBOOK OF FINNO-UGRIC STUDIES},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {The relevance of the article is explained by a new vision at the
   understanding of Erzya heroic poetry, its subjects, characters, features
   of its connection with history, specialty of the poetry and the
   aesthetics of the heroic song, the definition of the concept of
   ``hero{''} and ``bogatyr,{''} ``epic comprehension{''} and ``historical
   comprehension.{''} The heroic era of Erzya attests to its extraordinary
   vitality energy, the ability to constantly develop, improve, overcome
   its national character and dialogue with it. The purpose of the article
   is to present in the scientific community the heroic poetry of Erzya
   with its specific heroism, outlook, connections with historical reality.
   The goal of the article is to justify the fact that Erzya's heroic epic
   poetry is an original phenomenon of Russian and world folk art with its
   artistic and philosophical characteristics; that the time of its
   formation is an era of transition to an early class society, with the
   appearance of a nation and its ethnic identity. The article describes
   the heroic epic, which consists of heroic mythological and heroic epic
   stories and characters, depicts a heroic plot and character, reveals the
   connection of the epic with myth and history, emphasizes the subjects
   and characters of artistic incarnations, the personification of real
   ideas and problems of a decisive historical time. It is important that
   the heroic epic is formed during the transition from tribal way of life
   to early class society, and the hero acts as a cultural and social
   demiurge, the world organizer, the God's son and the earthly man, enjoys
   the protection of the gods; the paper argues that the epic hero is data
   whose range of actions are once and for all delineated, his path is
   predetermined, but these characteristics are only valid from the
   position of an external observer. In the chronotope of the epos, the
   epic hero is constantly evolving; he is finite outside the epic world;
   for those who already know their history, he has learned his
   ``scheme{''} and reveals the difference between the heroic epic and epic
   heroics, speaks about the peculiarities of the epic consciousness, its
   incompatibility with the historical consciousness of people. It is
   emphasized that the heroic conspiracy is forced to acquire life by the
   force of circumstances, is born in the popular consciousness as an
   expression of the actual ethnonational idea, a problem requiring
   resolution throughout the country, and serves as an artistic and
   aesthetic way to solve it.},

Abstract = {Objective: In our study, it was aimed to provide information training on
   immunization services, vaccine hesitancy and motivational interview
   technique to family health staff working in Edirne. Our research is a
   pre -post type intervention study. Material and Methods: The sample was
   not selected in the study and 90\% of the population was reached (n=
   110). In the study, the partici-pants were trained on the issues related
   to vaccination hesitancy, and the vaccination status of themselves and
   their relatives after the train-ing, their vaccination hesitancy and
   change in the unit where they work, their experience of vaccination
   hesitancy and their knowledge about motivational interviewing, and the
   change in their readiness in the man-agement of vaccination hesitations
   cases were evaluated.Results: Of the participants, 92\% stated that they
   had vaccinated in the adult age, 96\% of those with children and 70\% of
   those who had elderly relatives, also vaccinated them. Although the
   participants did not increase their participation in the vaccination
   proposal of themselves and their children with the training, the
   participation in the proposal of vaccination of their elderly relatives
   increased. Findings that changed significantly with the applied
   educational intervention; questioning the immunization status,
   participating in the seasonal flu vaccination recommendation,
   participating in the recommendation of the physi-cian and family health
   nurse to follow the vaccination process together, communication in
   vaccine refusal, necessity, effectiveness, content and reliability, side
   effect profile, and feeling ready to explain conspiracy theories
   increased significantly. Although there was nostatistically signif-icant
   difference with the training, hesitance from immunity campaigns
   decreased, while participation in the need for legal regulation
   increased. Although vaccine hesitancy of the participants did not make a
   statisti-cally significant difference, it decreased to four out of 12
   people after the training (p> 0.05). Of the participants, 45\% stated
   that they encountered vaccine hesitations in the primary health care
   unit. The most common reason stated in the cases encountered is the side
   effect profile.Conclusion: With the training intervention, family health
   workers were informed about vaccination and vaccination hesitations, and
   it was aimed to increase the capacity of immunization services in
   primary care. With the training, family health personnel felt
   significantly more pre-pared to interview vaccine hesitations cases.
   In-service training should be continued in order to maintain the
   effectiveness of the intervention and to enable healthcare professionals
   to manage vaccine refusal or hes-itations more effectively.},

Title = {The ABC of history education: a comparison of Australian, British and
   Canadian approaches to teaching national and First Nations histories},
Journal = {HISTORY OF EDUCATION REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 1},
Abstract = {Purpose - This essay engages with scholarship on history as a
   discipline, curriculum documents and academic and public commentary on
   the teaching of history in Australian, British and Canadian secondary
   contexts to better understand the influence of the tension between
   political pressure and disciplinary practice that drives the history
   wars in settler-colonial nations, how this plays out in secondary
   history classrooms and the ramifications this may have on students'
   democratic dispositions.Design/methodology/approach - This article aims
   to compare secondary history curricula and pedagogies in Australia,
   Britain and Canada to better articulate and conceptualise the influence
   of the ``history wars{''} over the teaching of national histories upon
   the intended and enacted curriculum and how this contributes to the
   formation of democratic dispositions within students. A conceptual
   model, drawing on the curriculum assessment of Porter (2006) and Gross
   and Terra's definition of ``difficult pasts{''} has been developed and
   used as the basis for this comparison. This model highlights the
   competing influences of political pressure upon curriculum creation and
   disciplinary change shaping pedagogy, and the impact these forces may
   have upon students' experience.Findings - The debate around what content
   students learn, and why, is fraught because it is a conversation about
   what each nation values and how they construct their own national
   identity(ies). This is particularly timely when the democratic
   self-identification of many nations is being challenged. The seditious
   conspiracy to storm the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, Orban's
   ``illiberal democracy{''} in Hungary and the neo-Nazis in Melbourne,
   Australia are examples of the rise of anti-democratic sentiment
   globally. Thus, new consideration of how we teach national histories and
   the impact this has on the formation of democratic dispositions and
   skills is pressing.Originality/value - The new articulation of a
   conceptual model for the impact of the history wars on education is an
   innovative synthesis of wide-ranging research on: the impacts of
   neoliberalism and cultural restorationism upon the development of
   intended curriculum; discipline-informed inquiry pedagogies used to
   enact the curriculum; and the teaching of national narratives as a
   political act. This comprehensive comparison of the ways in which
   history education in settler-colonial nations has developed over time
   provides new insight into the common elements of national history
   education, and the role this education can play in developing democratic
   dispositions.},

Title = {Family Planning and Contraception in Islamic Countries: A Critical
   Review of the Literature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Introduction: The population of the world reached seven billion in 2012.
   Pakistan's population stands at more than 180 million, is growing
   rapidly, and has the highest unmet need for family planning (FP) in
   isolated rural areas. The low usage of contraception in the rural areas
   of Pakistan correlates with the level of isolation, poverty, illiteracy,
   and to a large extent, religious misinterpretations/misconceptions.
   Almost 25\% of couples who desired FP services were not receiving them
   for a variety of reasons of which religion could be one, especially in
   the rural remote areas where the media is still not reaching and
   influencing mind-sets. In this scenario, the role of social marketing in
   bringing about attitudinal and behavioural change among users in
   underserved areas and gatekeepers and opinion makers in society must not
   be neglected.
   The work in promoting FP, contraception and birth spacing requires
   authentic evidence from similar sociocultural contexts and this
   endeavour of compiling case studies from various Islamic countries on
   their FP initiatives is a good step. Governments around the world,
   including many in the Islamic world, support FP programmes to enable
   individuals and couples to choose the number and timing of their
   children.
   Methods: This paper is a review of secondary data accessed through
   PubMed and Google Scholar. It provides an overview of Islamic countries'
   policies on, and support for FP and modern contraception. For this
   purpose, literature from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia,
   Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkey
   was included.
   Results: There are significant internal social and economic reasons to
   focus on FP in the Muslim world. Thus, arguments by religious scholars
   who see FP as an external western conspiracy aimed at curtailing the
   growth and strength of the Islamic world appear to be uninformed of both
   the socio-political and demographic realities in many Muslim countries,
   as well as the historical permissibility of contraception within the
   Islamic legacy. In fact, it can be argued that given the profound
   socio-economic and political difficulties in various parts of the Muslim
   world, a lack of FP and increasing populations would weaken and curtail
   the pace of overall development.
   Conclusion: Private institutions and the government must collaborate in
   leveraging initiatives and bridging gaps for more robust advocacy with
   clergymen and religious scholars to support the larger cause of FP and
   birth spacing i.e. improving infant and maternal health in Pakistan.},

Title = {Prevalence of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and Its Associated Factors
   among Chronic Disease Patients in a Resource Limited Setting in
   Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Study},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Month = {JAN 18},
Abstract = {Background. The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affects patients
   with chronic diseases. Thus, chronic disease patients are among the
   first high-risk population groups to get vaccinated. This might be
   challenged by vaccine hesitancy as it is one of the top ten global
   health issues for 2019. Furthermore, vaccination myths and conspiracy
   theories have been proliferating, and the developing world can readily
   embrace them, which might cause vaccine hesitancy. However, there is a
   paucity of evidence regarding chronic illness patient's willingness to
   be vaccinated. As a result, the aim of this study is to determine the
   magnitude of vaccine hesitancy and associated factors among chronic
   disease patients in Ethiopia. Method. An institutional-based
   cross-sectional study was conducted among adult ambulatory chronic
   disease patients who were selected using stratified sampling technique
   from June 1 to August 1, 2021. Data were collected through a
   face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire. Vaccine hesitancy
   was measured based on a questionnaire which was adapted from the
   reviewed literature. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression
   was used to identify factors, and variables with p < 0.05 were
   considered statistically significant. Result. A total of 422 respondents
   participated in the survey; the response rate was 99.7\%. The mean age
   of the participants was 45 years \& PLUSMN; 16.95 and 228 (54\%) of them
   were male. Almost half of the respondents (49.5\%) were hesitant toward
   the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants who were male (AOR = 1.56, 95\% CI:
   1.03, 2.35), having good knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR =
   1.60 95\% CI: 1.06, 2.41) and having a comorbidity (AOR = 3.36, 95\% CI:
   1.73, 6.56), were factors associated with the acceptance of the COVID-19
   vaccine. Conclusion. The level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was high.
   The COVID-19 vaccine's acceptability was influenced by being a man,
   having knowledge about the vaccine and having comorbidities.
   Furthermore, the most prevalent reason for refusing to take the
   vaccination is a fear that it may not be safe. As a result, public
   awareness campaigns should concentrate on delivering more information
   about the COVID-19 vaccine's safety and efficacy. Furthermore, it is
   critical to disseminate accurate information, particularly among women,
   and to educate people about the vaccine.},

   the IberLEF 2022 Workshop on Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum, within
   the framework of the SEPLN 2022 conference. We proposed two hierarchical
   subtasks: For subtask 1, participants had to determine the presence of
   stereotypes in sentences. For subtask 2, participants had to classify
   the sentences labeled with stereotypes into ten categories. The DETESTS
   dataset contains 5,629 sentences in comments in response to newspaper
   articles related to immigration in Spanish. 51 teams signed up to
   participate, of which 39 sent runs, and 5 of them sent their working
   notes. In this paper, we provide information about the training and test
   datasets, the systems used by the participants, the evaluation metrics
   of the systems and their results.},

Abstract = {Research in U.S. government archives concerning World War I-era German
   espionage activities in the United States reveals a number of previously
   unknown surveillance files regarding film actor and director Erich von
   Stroheim. The essay describes the process through which these otherwise
   un-indexed files were discovered and reprints several of the key
   documents. Evidence indicates that Military Intelligence suspected a
   link between von Stroheim and German operatives working in California
   before the American declaration of war. Wilhelm von Brincken, convicted
   of espionage for such activity in 1918, was later a confident and
   co-worker of von Stroheim's in Hollywood. While the files reveal
   significant new information on von Stroheim's activities in this period,
   they are also shown to contain inconsistencies, unverified allegations,
   and numerous errors of fact.},

Title = {Examining Rural and Urban Sentiment Difference in COVID-19-Related
   Topics on Twitter: Word Embedding-Based Retrospective Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Background: By the end of 2022, more than 100 million people were
   infected with COVID-19 in the United States, and the cumulative death
   rate in rural areas (383.5/100,000) was much higher than in urban areas
   (280.1/100,000). As the pandemic spread, people used social media
   platforms to express their opinions and concerns about COVID-19-related
   topics.
   Objective: This study aimed to (1) identify the primary COVID-19-related
   topics in the contiguous United States communicated over Twitter and (2)
   compare the sentiments urban and rural users expressed about these
   topics.
   Methods: We collected tweets containing geolocation data from May 2020
   to January 2022 in the contiguous United States. We relied on the
   tweets' geolocations to determine if their authors were in an urban or
   rural setting. We trained multiple word2vec models with several corpora
   of tweets based on geospatial and timing information. Using a word2vec
   model built on all tweets, we identified hashtags relevant to COVID-19
   and performed hashtag clustering to obtain related topics. We then ran
   an inference analysis for urban and rural sentiments with respect to the
   topics based on the similarity between topic hashtags and opinion
   adjectives in the corresponding urban and rural word2vec models.
   Finally, we analyzed the temporal trend in sentiments using monthly
   word2vec models.
   Results: We created a corpus of 407 million tweets, 350 million (86\%)
   of which were posted by users in urban areas, while 18 million (4.4\%)
   were posted by users in rural areas. There were 2666 hashtags related to
   COVID-19, which clustered into 20 topics. Rural users expressed stronger
   negative sentiments than urban users about COVID-19 prevention
   strategies and vaccination (P<.001). Moreover, there was a clear
   political divide in the perception of politicians by urban and rural
   users; these users communicated stronger negative sentiments about
   Republican and Democratic politicians, respectively (P<.001). Regarding
   misinformation and conspiracy theories, urban users exhibited stronger
   negative sentiments about the ``covidiots{''} and ``China virus{''}
   topics, while rural users exhibited stronger negative sentiments about
   the ``Dr. Fauci{''} and ``plandemic{''} topics. Finally, we observed
   that urban users' sentiments about the economy appeared to transition
   from negative to positive in late 2021, which was in line with the US
   economic recovery.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates there is a statistically
   significant difference in the sentiments of urban and rural Twitter
   users regarding a wide range of COVID-19-related topics. This suggests
   that social media can be relied upon to monitor public sentiment during
   pandemics in disparate types of regions. This may assist in the
   geographically targeted deployment of epidemic prevention and management
   efforts.},

Abstract = {The author of the article combined findings published in other articles,
   archival sources and bibliographical analysis of several printed books
   by the Italian humanist man of letters and diplomat Giangiorgio Trissino
   in order to dispel the doubts about the identity of Trissino's printer
   Bartolomeo Zanetti who used the pseudonym Tolomeo Ianiculo to hide his
   real name when working with Trissino. Bibliographical analysis of
   material (non-textual) elements of some Trissino's books available
   nowadays revealed that they were printed in a manner corresponding to
   Zanetti's printing style. When printing Trissino's works in 1529,
   Zanetti worked as a travelling and occasional printer without his own
   movable type, printing press and the possibility of regular supply of
   paper. All these circumstances were ``imprinted{''} on his books, which
   allows us to ``read{''} them historically. The author of the article was
   also interested in the reasons why Zanetti decided to reject the fame he
   could have shared with Trissino. At that time, printers were usually
   proud of their work as printing required the mastery of a more advanced
   technique than manuscript binding. In addition, printed items reached
   the masses, thus increasing printers' fame and giving them the
   possibility of transcending their mortality, which was an important goal
   of a Renaissance man. The reasons for using a pseudonym were much deeper
   than in the case of Palladio - the pseudonym that Trissino assigned to
   the promising contractor Andrea di Pietro. They sprang from an
   environment imbued with espionage and conspiracy, with both
   characterizing Trissino and Zanetti's lives and work during an intense
   period marked by war and political intrigues. Only when reading
   ``between the lines{''}, one can put together a feasible and meaningful
   mosaic out of seemingly unconnected and arbitrary fragments of empirical
   ``facts{''}. What the two protagonists had in common was the knowledge
   of Greek and acquaintanceship with Greek scholars and medical circles,
   interest in calligraphy and printing, as well as in all activities
   necessary for intelligence and other secret services. The real identity
   of Trissino's printer can be inferred with great certainty from the book
   on poisons and antidotes that features Trissino's signet and Zanetti's
   real name. Having been created in the information centre of
   anti-Venetian alliances during a huge scandal (/ segretari del 1542)
   whose main agent - the French Ambassador Guillaume Pellicier - had
   financed its publication, the book also confirms the suspicion that they
   were both involved in the intelligence service. Therefore it can be
   concluded that by using Trissino's signet Zanetti wanted to protect
   himself as Venice had already forgiven the courteous man of letters and
   diplomat his pro-Habsburg sympathies.},

Abstract = {Background: Accurate, updated estimates of the incidence and prevalence
   of sexually transmitted infections in the United States remain elusive.
   The most widely quoted number of new sexually transmitted disease (STD)
   cases each year is 12 million. However, this figure has not changed in
   more than a decade, despite improvements in detection methods and the
   effects of STD control programs,
   Goals: To propose a system for weighing the strength of STD surveillance
   data and to estimate the incidence and prevalence of STDs in the United
   States for 1996, using the available published data.
   Results: We estimate that more than 15 million STD infections occurred
   in the United States in 1996, This number exceeds the earlier estimate
   primarily because improved detection techniques have allowed an
   assessment of previously undiagnosed infections.
   Conclusions: Large numbers of new STDs continue to occur each year in
   the United States, with serious health and economic consequences. More
   than two thirds of our current estimate of 15 million STDs annually
   consists of two infections-trichomoniasis and human papillomavirus-for
   which we have only level III surveillance data. As the quality of our
   surveillance data improves, we can further refine the precision of our
   national estimates.},

Title = {The significance of digital media in local public space crisis
   management: The case of Poland, the United Kingdom and Italy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARAB \& MUSLIM MEDIA RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {This article recognizes the potential and possibilities of digital media
   in COVID-19 crisis management in different democratic systems. It is the
   comparative analy-sis of information management during the COVID-19
   pandemic in Poland, the United Kingdom and Italy. From the theoretical
   approach, the crisis management usually deals with two main models. The
   first one is defined as the post-reactive model, which is based on
   reacting to events after the first symptoms of the crisis and the
   communication model remains the top-down process. The second one is
   described as the pro-reactive model, which is based on building a
   dialogue space with the participatory community and it is the bottom-up
   communication process. In this case, the community becomes an active
   partner in bridging the crisis. The main goal of the proposed article is
   to examine the ways in which digital media influences the quality of
   strategic communication management in local public spaces and what type
   of crisis management strategy is applied to each political culture. The
   article discusses the pros and cons of information distributed through
   digital platforms by both the media and public institutions in terms of
   community awareness and crisis governance. The article applies a mixed
   method approach, which includes content analysis (media and governmental
   digital services), inter-views (with the authorities' members and media
   representatives) and social media network analysis (mainly Facebook).
   The analysis has been ongoing since the beginning of the pandemic in
   Europe (March-September 2020). The research has demonstrated that the
   shape and distribution of information during the pandemic were of great
   importance for the quality of information strategy activities. The
   problem was noticeable disinformation at all levels, which was the
   result of a lack of control over the message and the pursuit of
   sensation or conspiracy. It was clearly observed that without the
   support of crisis communication during the pandemic by the media, mainly
   digital platforms, it would be impossible to implement it. In all three
   countries, social media was the `information management centre' in the
   COVID-19 era, but the activity of individual municipalities was slightly
   differ-ent. As far as the urbanized and semi-urbanized level is
   concerned, some consist-ency can be observed. In all three cases,
   communication on social media platforms was conducted very intensively
   and with the use of various tools (texts, statistics, instructional
   videos, scientific articles, infographics, etc.). All the `organizers'
   of the local public sphere (presidents, mayors, journalists, service
   representatives) tried to keep in touch with the inhabitants.},

Journal = {PHILOLOGICAL CLASS},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {155-166},
Abstract = {The article presents a critical review of research works on the topic
   ``Folklore-literary interaction in the creative activity of A.M.
   Remizov{''} published in Russian. The study of the topic has been
   conducted mainly within the framework of literary criticism. Meanwhile,
   for a writer known for his commitment to preservation and innovative
   approach to traditional literary genres, folklore is one of the dominant
   sources of creativity. Currently, Remizov studies cannot boast of
   generalizing works on folklorism in the writer's creative activity and
   on the influence of oral folk art genres on his artistic system, so one
   of the aims of the article is to attract scholarly interest to the issue
   and stimulate further research in this area. The publication gives a
   brief description of the current state of research on the problem,
   identifies the main vectors of its consideration and reveals the
   academic lacunae. The author analyzes the works, which deal with the
   creative heritage from the point of view of folklore studies and address
   the problems of the typology of folklorism and mythologism of the
   writer, clarify the range of folklore sources and the specificity of
   working with them, as well as the role and function of the author's
   comments on the miniatures of Posoloni. These notes to the texts were
   created under the influence of a literary scandal related to the
   accusation of the writer of plagiarism. The assessment of the events
   around this incident by specialists in Remisov studies and folklorists
   does not coincide, the article outlines prospects for further research.
   The author undertakes a detailed description of the influence of the
   texts of calendar rite, spiritual verses, fairy tale, conspiracy-spell
   tradition, folk drama, children's folklore and Russian folk pictures on
   the writer's creative activity. For the first time, the author poses a
   hypothesis about the possible influence of the aesthetics of rayok
   ({''}World Cosmorama{''}) on the work of A. M. Remizov by the example of
   the fairy-tale novella ``What is Tobacco{''}, which which depicts the
   reformatting of the apocryphal model by artistic means of lubok and
   rayok. The analysis of numerous studies made it possible for the author
   of the article to conclude that the writer's creative activity does not
   only reflect the real diversity of folklore genres but also such
   specific features of them as oral format and variability. The results of
   the study can be used in the design of the course of the history of
   Russian literature and folklore studies of the beginning of the early
   20th century, in the studies dealing with folklore-literary interaction,
   and in popularization and publication of folklore texts.},

Title = {Vladimir Mesamed. Anti-Israeli Rhetoric as Part of Iran's Foreign Policy},
Journal = {JUDAICA UKRAINICA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {1},
Pages = {201-224},
Abstract = {The article deals with the anti-Israel stance that forms an important
   component of Iranian president Ahmadincjad's foreign policy. Anti-Israel
   declarations began to be voiced in Iran immediately after the victory of
   the Islamic revolution. The establishment of the Jewish state and its
   subsequent recognition were regarded as disastrous for the Muslims by
   the late revolution's leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He was the one
   that urged for the complete destruction of Israel. Khomeini's successor
   as the spiritual leader of the country, Ali Khamenei, is also well-known
   for his anti-Israel rhetoric. He called Israel a cancerous tumor in the
   Middle East that had to be removed. When the reformists took to power in
   the years 1997-2005, such stances directed against Israel were rare,
   and, addressing international and home audiences, then president Seyyed
   Mohammad Khatami refrained from any declarations of that kind.
   Anti-Israel rhetoric was harnessed by the current Iranian president, M.
   Ahmadincjad, mainly to seek wider support by the people of the country
   and bring the nation together in the face of a foreign threat. As a
   long-standing enemy, Israel fit well into the image. Anti-Israel
   rhetoric could be regarded as unconditionally following Khomeini's
   legacy, which is a winning strategy in Iran. Moreover, a call to destroy
   Israel can both boost the solidarity of the Iranians and also provoke
   the condemnation of the entire world, the West being at the forefront.
   That's precisely what Ahmadinejad and his aides are looking for.
   Following the naturally strong reaction of the world community, Iran can
   pass off as the victim of an imperialistic Zionist conspiracy.
   Anti-Israel sentiments have been haunting Ahmadinejad since his first
   term of office becoming the major component of all of his foreign policy
   declarations. His recurring declarations have been to ``wipe off Israel
   from the global map{''}, to remove the Zionist tumor from the Middle
   East, and the like. Not only has anti-Israel rhetoric intensified under
   Ahmadinejad, but it has also acquired new forms and directions.
   Lately, one of the most important of these has been the denial of the
   Holocaust and the attempts to link it to the problems of the Israel -
   PLO interaction. Those in Iran that deny the Holocaust find their own
   peculiar rationale to justify their arguments publishing numerous
   articles in this connection.
   By reinforcing anti-Israel rhetoric, Ahmadinejad has been attempting to
   reach the goal set forth by Iran's religious elite - to marginalize
   public opinions in order to retain power at the hands of the very
   conservative religious leadership of the country.},

Title = {Secret scouting organizations in Poland, 1944-1956},
Journal = {PAMIEC I SPRAWIEDLIWOSC},

Pages = {119-159},
Abstract = {Secret scouting organizations are considered to have been an important
   element of the Polish independence underground in post-war Poland.
   During the period 1944-1956, at least 122 secret youth organizations
   were formed in Poland, which ideologically and structurally referred to
   scouting movement. Being a response to current political and social
   situation in Poland, they were born spontaneously. Those secret groups
   used to resort to various forms of defiance against the communist system
   among which the most important one was a propaganda activity similar to
   `` minor-sabotage{''} operations carried out by the Szare Szeregi {[}the
   Grey Ranks]. The scouts painted anti-communist and anti-Soviet slogans
   on the walls, distributed illegal papers, newspapers and leaflets. Some
   of the organizations carried out various sabotage operations, such as:
   the disarming People's Army of Poland {[}Ludowe Wojsko Polskie, LWP] and
   Red Army soldiers as well as MO {[}Milicja Obywatelska, the Citizens'
   Militia] and UB {[}Urzad Bezpieczenstwa, the Security Office]
   functionaries, the trains' derailing, the banks, post offices and shops
   raiding. Young people, basing on the pre-war patterns, conducted a
   typical scouting activity. They organized scout camps and bivouacs,
   gained successive scout degrees and skills. A scout conspiracy was
   rather short-term -from a few to several months, nevertheless there were
   particular organizations being active for years. However, sometimes a
   responsibility for `` slip-ups{''} fell on conspirators who carried out
   their actions without following necessary precautions, like a carbon
   paper already used to copy the organization statute or a leaflet,
   carelessly thrown out to a dustbin. Polish underground groups were
   worked out by the developed secret collaborators network of the Security
   Office {[}Urzad Bezpieczenstwa, UB]. Once UB managed to track down even
   one of the conspirators it meant the end of functioning of the whole
   group. The arrestment of one of the scouts was shortly followed by
   another. Detained young people were subjected to an immediate enquiry
   and put under psychical and brutal physical pressure. Statements taken
   in that way, provided a firm basis for bringing the case to military
   court. Every effort was made to give the trial propagandist character
   and thus its particular elements were carefully directed -starting from
   reading off an indictment act to pronouncing a sentence. What is more,
   the young people's trials must have been reported in media. In
   consequence of judicial proceedings, harsh sentences were carried out
   completely disproportionate to the committed `` offences{''}. People
   were sentenced to at least a few years in prison and courts did not
   hesitate to impose substantial punishments.},

Abstract = {The death of Jozef Franczak represents the end of the underground fight
   for the Polish independence. Before the war he was a non-commissioned
   officer. Then he fought in the war of 1939. On escaping from Soviet
   captivity at the end of 1939 he started a conspiracy and continued it
   for the next 24 years. Under the German occupation he was a commander of
   a secret squad and after the ``liberation{''} a commander of patrol in
   the division of Capt. Zdzislaw ``Uskok{''} Bronski. After 1953 he went
   into hiding, supported by his collaborators. The Communist Secret
   Service estimated the number of people who helped him at over 200. He
   hid in villages near Piaski town, 30 kilometers southeast of Lublin. The
   article reveals facts from the last period of his hiding and the SB
   methods which were supposed to lead to his apprehension (or
   elimination). His nearest family and people suspected of helping him
   came under careful scrutiny. It is worth noting that listening devices
   were installed at homes of his sisters and friends. Moreover, in the
   buildings of the SB collaborators who lived near to the households of
   the suspected people there were located so-called points of undercover
   observation. More than once, two or three SB officers with the aid of a
   secret collaborator kept them under surveillance for as long as a month.
   One of the main methods employed by SB officers, who wanted to track
   Franczak down, was recruiting people who lived in the area as common
   informers. Their task was to ask around about his hide-outs and watch
   the members of the closest family and other people who were involved. It
   is estimated that at the time, the SB enlisted more than a hundred
   people who yielded to blackmail, expected material gains or were guided
   by patriotic motives. Thanks to the systematic operational research, in
   January of 1963 the right candidate for a secret agent was selected. He
   was a close relative of Franczak's fiancee. He lived in Lublin but
   following SB orders he started visiting his hometown and collected
   information about the fugitive and his helpers. Having the confidence of
   Franczak's family he was put in touch with ``Lalek{''} in August of
   1963. From that moment on SB started an operational ``game,{''} which
   succeeded thanks to information provided by the secret collaborator. On
   the 21st of October 1963 Jozef Franczak was surrounded and shot down by
   an operational group of SB-ZOMO officers.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the paper is revealing the peculiarities of Voltaire's
   views on the last stage of the Northern War, ended by the Treaty of
   Nystad, as well as presenting the specific character of the great
   enlightener's evaluation of the Russian empire and its historical
   role.The author finds out, why Voltaire, condemning fascination with the
   history of wars and kings, in his two works: ``The History of Charles
   XII{''} and ``The History of the Russian Empire under Peter the
   Greats{''} paid great attention to the Northern War and Peter l's
   participation in it.
   The reasons of the French historian interest to the named subject are
   viewed in terms of the modern methods of historical analysis,
   ``philosophical{''} basis of his views on war and civilization, features
   of historical presentation.
   The paper shows Voltaire's change in attitude on interpretation of the
   military historical subjects, first covered in ``The History of Charles
   XII{''} and then in ``The History of the Russian Empire under Peter the
   Greats{''}. The focus of the paper is on the up to the present-day
   controversial issue, whether Peter I was involved in Gorth-Alberoni
   conspiracy, aimed at the complete political change in the appearance of
   Europe. The 18th century historian ultimately came to the conclusion
   that the Tsar had made use of Gorth's plans as a tactic means for
   solving his own foreign policy problems. This point of view is shared by
   many contemporary historians. Peter l's declaring Emperor was the direct
   consequence of victorious end of the Northern War. It was found that
   Voltaire drew a more optimistic picture of Peter l's imperial title
   recognition, than it actually was. According to Voltaire, the specific
   feature of the Russian Empire, created by Peter I, lies in the fact that
   it was a self-civilizing empire, bringing enlightenment on the
   neighboring << barbaricy, peoples.
   The author of the paper, reviewing specific cases, arrives at a
   conclusion, that Voltaire's works of high confidence for their time took
   a worthy standing in the world historiography of the Petrine era, due to
   a wide range of sources, the historian's ability for their critical
   assessment, his seeking to maintain a certain evaluation independence in
   the description of events from different perspectives, his commitment to
   historical truth, his talent of a writer.
   The work is carried out within the project, aimed at publishing a first
   complete scientific edition of ``The History of the Russian Empire under
   Peter the Great{''} in Russian.},

Title = {The ``horse-meat{''} scandal: illegal activity in the food supply chain},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {565-578},
Month = {JUL 13},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Food supply chain theory and practice generally assumes that the
   business practices and processes involved are ethical, legal and
   value-adding when this is not always so, as demonstrated by the ongoing
   2013 horse-meat scandal. Although it is ostensibly a UK-based affair, it
   encompasses the meat processing industry across Europe. This study,
   thus, aims to examine supply chain criminality and to highlight
   ``scandal scripts{''} which amplify underlying issues.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A systematic review of extant literature on the scandal adds to that
   body of work, updating the existing narrative to include a detailed
   analysis of convicted ``industry insiders{''}, highlighting supply chain
   issues involved in the frauds. Micro-stories of businessmen involved are
   presented to enable an empirical exploration of their illegal
   involvement in the meat trade. Using storied data from accounts of the
   scandal as contemporary examples, emerging themes and issues are
   outlined through a mixed methods qualitative approach consisting of
   ethical covert research, using documentary research strategy underpinned
   by narrative inquiry.
   Findings
   Media coverage perpetuated various myths notably that the fraud was
   carried out by ``shadowy{''}, Eastern European ``mafia figures{''}
   exploiting the extended food supply chains. The analysis is aided by the
   use of media hypothesis. Far from being a mafia-inspired fraud, the
   criminal activity was organised in nature and committed by insider
   businessmen. The findings demonstrate that supply chains are complex and
   require an understanding of storied business practices, including the
   ethical and illegal.
   Research limitations/implications
   From an academic perspective, there are implications such as the dearth
   of academic research and policy-related studies into food fraud possibly
   because of the difficulty in obtaining data because of access to such
   enterprises and entrepreneurs necessitating reliance upon documentary
   sources and investigative journalism.
   Practical implications
   There are distinct policy implications, particularly the need to
   legislate against international criminal conspiracies and everyday
   ordinary organised food frauds perpetuated. Lax penalties do little to
   prevent such crimes which need to be taken more seriously by the
   authorities, and treated as major crime. In formulating food laws, rules
   and regulations, greater cognisance should be taken to consider how
   supply chains in the food industry could be better protected from
   predatory criminal actions.
   Originality/value
   This novel qualitative study will enable academics and practitioners to
   better understand illegal enterprise, food fraud and risk management
   from both operational and supply chain perspectives and will be useful
   to investigators by furthering our understanding of entrepreneurial
   practice and morality in the food industry.},

Abstract = {Background: Epidemiologic mass treatment and syndrome management are two
   sexually transmitted disease (STD) control strategies that are receiving
   increased attention internationally, The former is a population-based
   intervention, whereas the latter attempts to improve the quality and
   efficiency of clinic-based STD case management.
   Methods: The published literature on these subjects was reviewed.
   Results: Epidemiologic mass treatment refers to treatment of whole
   communities (mass treatment) or high-risk subgroups within communities
   (targeted presumptive treatment) based on high STD prevalence rates.
   Syndrome management overcomes many obstacles to provision of quality STD
   case management by basing treatment decisions on recognition of easily
   identifiable syndromes. Experience with application of these strategies
   is summarized, and their possible use as STD control measures in
   communities with similar conditions is discussed.
   Conclusions: Epidemiologic mass treatment may be an effective approach
   to rapidly reduce STD transmission in high prevalence communities,
   especially when high-risk core groups are effectively reached. Once high
   prevalence rates are brought down, however, longer term strategies,
   including improved STD case management, are essential to maintain
   reduced rates.},

Abstract = {The mutual dynamical evolution of visible and dark matter in spiral
   galaxies may have resulted in some kind of coupling between the
   distributions of visible and dark matter today. This conjecture is
   empirically explored in the present paper, where rotation curves of 60
   spiral galaxies and universal rotation curves are fitted using dark halo
   models with a distribution that depends on the luminous mass
   distribution. It is shown that the dark matter profiles of any universal
   rotation curve can be decomposed into two components: (1) a main
   component, called ``coupled halo,{''} and (2) a component having a
   gaslike distribution, negligible in bright galaxies, but of increasing
   significance toward faint galaxies. Once the disk component (stars, gas,
   and gaslike component) is subtracted, the dark halo integrated surface
   densities, sigma(d)(r), are in a plane (in log scale) sigma(d)(2)(r) =
   sigma(gamma)sigma(r), where the fundamental parameters are the disk
   integrated surface density, sigma(r), and a surface density,
   sigma(gamma), which depends on the galaxy system only and characterizes
   the relative importance of the dark halo to the disk mass. This is the
   coupled halo. In the case of an exponential disk, the coupled halo has a
   central profile of the form rho proportional to r(-1) and a hat curve at
   r greater than or equal to r(opt). The fact that the gaslike component
   decreases with luminosity suggests that it may be transformed into
   stars, and therefore could be dark baryons, possibly cold gas in the
   disk. In these models, the baryonic fraction (stars, gas, and gaslike
   component) is almost a constant over a range of 5 mag, that is, similar
   to 30\% at 1.5 optical radii. The stellar fraction of baryonic matter
   increases with luminosity. The model predicts a large fraction of
   gaslike baryonic dark matter in faint spiral galaxies, i.e., in H I
   gas-rich systems. The mass fraction of this gaslike component is
   negligible in a galaxy like the Milky Way, and reaches half the halo
   mass in the faint, low surface brightness galaxy DDO 154. Some
   fine-tuning relations, which look mysterious in the context of
   isothermal halos, are deduced from the coupled halos. The Tully-Fisher
   relation results from the coupling relation between visible and dark
   matter surface densities and from the virial theorem. The empirical
   coupling relation can be used in simulations of the dynamical evolution
   of gas and stars plus dark matter subsystems to constrain the nature of
   the halo dark matter. If a form of halo dark matter complies with the
   coupling relation, it will fit rotation curves without fine-tuning
   conspiracies.},

Title = {THE 1952 VANRIEBEECK,JAN TERCENTENARY FESTIVAL - CONSTRUCTING AND
   CONTESTING PUBLIC NATIONAL HISTORY IN SOUTH-AFRICA},

Abstract = {For all approaches to the South African past the icon of Jan Van
   Riebeeck looms large. Perspectives supportive of the political project
   of white domination created and perpetuate the icon as the bearer of
   civilization to the sub-continent and its source of history. Opponents
   of racial oppression have portrayed Van Riebeeck as public (history)
   enemy number one of the South African national past. Van Riebeeck
   remains the figure around which South Africa's history is made and
   contested.
   But this has not always been the case. Indeed up until the 1950s, Van
   Riebeeck appeared only in passing in school history texts, and the day
   of his landing at the Cape was barely commemorated. From the 1950s,
   however, Van Riebeeck acquired centre stage in South Africa's public
   history. This was not the result of an Afrikaner Nationalist conspiracy
   but arose out of an attempt to create a settler nationalist ideology.
   The means to achieve this was a massive celebration throughout the
   country of the 300th anniversary of Van Riebeeck's landing. Here was an
   attempt to display the growing power of the apartheid state and to
   assert its confidence.
   A large festival fair and imaginative historical pageants were pivotal
   events in establishing the paradigm of a national history and
   constituting its key elements. The political project of the apartheid
   state was justified in the festival fair through the juxtaposition of
   `civilization' and economic progress with `primitiveness' and social
   `backwardness'. The historical pageant in the streets of Cape Town
   presented a version of South Africa's past that legitimated settler
   rule.
   Just as the Van Riebeeck tercentenary afforded the white ruling bloc an
   opportunity to construct an ideological hegemony, it was grasped by the
   Non-European Unity Movement and the African National Congress to launch
   political campaigns. Through the public mediums of the resistance press
   and the mass meeting these organizations presented a counter-history of
   South Africa. These oppositional forms were an integral part of the
   making of the festival and the Van Riebeeck icon. In the conflict which
   played itself out in 1952 there was a remarkable consensus about the
   meaning of Van Riebeeck's landing in 1652. The narrative constructed,
   both by those seeking to establish apartheid and those who sought to
   challenge it, represented Van Riebeeck a the spirit of apartheid and the
   originator of white domination. The ideological frenzy in the centre of
   Cape Town in 1952 resurrected Van Riebeeck from obscurity and historical
   amnesia to become the lead actor on South Africa's public history stage.},

   healthcare workers: Results from the UK-REACH prospective nationwide
   cohort study},
Journal = {LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE},

Abstract = {Background: In most countries, healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a
   priority group for vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to their elevated risk of COVID-19 and
   potential contribution to nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Concerns
   have been raised that HCWs from ethnic minority groups are more likely
   to be vaccine hesitant (defined by the World Health Organisation as
   refusing or delaying a vaccination) than those of White ethnicity, but
   there are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy and its
   predictors in UK HCWs.
   Methods: Nationwide prospective cohort study and qualitative study in a
   multi-ethnic cohort of clinical and non-clinical UK HCWs. We analysed
   ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy adjusting for
   demographics, vaccine trust, and perceived risk of COVID-19. We explored
   reasons for hesitancy in qualitative data using a framework analysis.
   Findings: 11,584 HCWs were included in the cohort analysis. 23\% (2704)
   reported vaccine hesitancy. Compared to White British HCWs (21.3\%
   hesitant), HCWs fromBlack Caribbean (54.2\%), Mixed White and Black
   Caribbean (38.1\%), Black African (34.4\%), Chinese (33.1\%), Pakistani
   (30.4\%), and White Other (28.7\%) ethnic groups were significantly more
   likely to be hesitant. In adjusted analysis, Black Caribbean (aOR 3.37,
   95\% CI 2.11 - 5.37), Black African (aOR 2.05, 95\% CI 1.49 - 2.82),
   White Other ethnic groups (aOR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.19 - 1.84) were
   significantly more likely to be hesitant. Other independent predictors
   of hesitancy were younger age, female sex, higher score on a COVID-19
   conspiracy beliefs scale, lower trust in employer, lack of influenza
   vaccine uptake in the previous season, previous COVID-19, and pregnancy.
   Qualitative data from 99 participants identified the following
   contributors to hesitancy: lack of trust in government and employers,
   safety concerns due to the speed of vaccine development, lack of ethnic
   diversity in vaccine studies, and confusing and conflicting information.
   Participants felt uptake in ethnic minority communities might be
   improved through inclusive communication, involving HCWs in the vaccine
   rollout, and promoting vaccination through trusted networks.
   Interpretation: Despite increased risk of COVID-19, HCWs from some
   ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant than their
   White British colleagues. Strategies to build trust and dispel myths
   surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine in these communities are urgently
   required. Emphasis should be placed on the safety and benefit of
   SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnancy and in those with previous COVID-19.
   Public health communications should be inclusive, non-stigmatising and
   utilise trusted networks. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {COVID-19 Information Sources and Misinformation by Faith Community},
Journal = {INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Faith communities support a variety of public health initiatives as
   conduits of information and service distribution points. However, with
   the onset of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), there is concern that
   religious communities may be echo chambers for misinformation and
   conspiracy theories that are undercutting the adoption of precautions to
   prevent transmission and the use of COVID-19 vaccines. The purpose of
   this study is to identify the receptivity to and spread of
   misinformation about COVID-19 by faith communities and whether embracing
   these inaccuracies constitutes a uniquely religious effect. This study
   conducted three small analyses approach. First, we engaged in the
   automated text mining of approximately 2.3 million discussion posts from
   discussion forums noted for their conspiracism and extremism. Next,
   secondary quantitative analysis of two recent surveys from the American
   Trends Panels by Pew Research conducted in April 2020 (N = 9482) and
   February 2021 (N = 9429) were conducted to determine whether sources of
   information and preventive behaviors related to the pandemic were
   associated with uniquely religious effects or possibly mediated by other
   factors such as sociodemographic characteristics or political views. The
   association of White evangelicals with politicized misinformation was
   consistent across all three small studies. Prior to the availability of
   vaccines, religious themes consistently appeared in 15-19\% of COVID-19
   social media posts and were higher in subsets of the discourse tied to
   misinformation. The framing of COVID-19 using religious language was
   associated with the Christian right in about half of the
   religiously-themed posts. Religious themes fell below the 15\% threshold
   once the vaccine was available. In the survey research, small, uniquely
   religious effects were found with White evangelical receptivity of
   COVID-19 information from Donald Trump and less reliance on information
   from public health experts, and small, uniquely religious associations
   were found with preventive measures. Among White nonevangelical
   Protestants and non-Hispanic Roman Catholics, there was found the same
   combination of a higher likelihood of reliance on messages from the
   Donald Trump Presidency and a lower likelihood for news-media use. Black
   Protestants showed a higher level of use and trust in state and local
   government officials. The study confirmed higher use of social media
   among non-Hispanic Roman Catholics but did not find this relationship
   among Hispanic Protestants. Faith communities are not always receptive
   to public health messages that promote the public good. This study
   indicates that the religion effects can appear early, giving time for
   health education specialists to address them, and that these effects can
   diminish once preventive measures are available.},

Title = {Inner Strength of Female Characters in <i>Loitering with Intent</i> and
   <i>The Public</i> Image by Muriel Spark},
Journal = {TEXT MATTERS-A JOURNAL OF LITERATURE THEORY AND CULTURE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {1},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Women characters in Muriel Spark's novels are diverse, some strong and
   powerful, some weak and unable to make decisions. And there are
   characters who develop throughout the novel and learn from their own
   mistakes. From being passive, they gradually start acting and making
   their own choices. Loitering with Intent and The Public Image present
   women characters who go through metamorphosis, from being dependent on
   others into living their own lives and freeing themselves from former
   influences. Such kaleidoscopic change enables them not only to be able
   to finally make their own decisions but also to overcome many difficult
   situations threatening their future life.
   Fleur Talbot, a heroine in Loitering with Intent, finds herself at a
   point in which she thinks that everything she cares for is lost.
   Chronically passive and naive, she cannot imagine another way of being
   until she understands that she is being cheated, that her life will be
   ruined if she does not act. Everyone around her seems to be in
   conspiracy against her; only taking a firm stand and opposing her
   surrounding world can help. Fleur's life has become totally dependent on
   her ability to be strong and decisive. She knows that if she remains
   what she is, her career and prospects for the future will be lost, so
   she decides to prove her determination and her will to be finally happy.
   Her transformation into a powerful character saves her dignity and makes
   her a successful writer.
   Annabel, a character in The Public Image is the same type of person as
   Fleur, as she lacks self-confidence and has no support from anybody,
   even her own husband. Muriel Spark, however, presents her as another
   example of a heroine who develops as the action progresses, able to
   evoke strength in herself when her situation seems hopeless. Annabel, at
   first treated as a puppet in the hands of other people, who use her
   image for their own benefit, shows that she is capable of anything by
   the book's end. When her career and reputation are threatened and her
   privacy invaded, she decides to leave the country. This requires both
   effort and sacrifice, as she has to leave behind everything she has
   worked for all her life, but this is the necessary price for her
   freedom.
   The ability of both female characters to show so much determination
   reveals an inherent inner strength, and their weakness and vulnerability
   as just superficial. When the situation requires it, both Annabel and
   Fleur are ready to fight for their rights, for their freedom and self
   esteem, and they discover that they are indeed capable of changing their
   lives.},

Title = {Acceptance and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines: A cross-sectional
   study from Jordan},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Vaccines are effective interventions that can reduce the high burden of
   diseases globally. However, public vaccine hesitancy is a pressing
   problem for public health authorities. With the availability of COVID-19
   vaccines, little information is available on the public acceptability
   and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines in Jordan. This study aimed
   to investigate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and its predictors
   in addition to the attitudes towards these vaccines among public in
   Jordan. An online, cross-sectional, and self-administered questionnaire
   was instrumentalized to survey adult participants from Jordan on the
   acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis was
   used to find the predictors of COVID-19 vaccines' acceptability. A total
   of 3,100 participants completed the survey. The public acceptability of
   COVID-19 vaccines was fairly low (37.4\%) in Jordan. Males (OR = 2.488,
   95CI\% = 1.834-3.375, p < .001) and those who took the seasonal
   influenza vaccine (OR = 2.036, 95CI\% = 1.306-3.174, p = .002) were more
   likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, participants who believed
   that vaccines are generally safe (OR = 9.258, 95CI\% = 6.020-14.237, p <
   .001) and those who were willing to pay for vaccines (OR = 19.223,
   95CI\% = 13.665-27.042, p < .001), once available, were more likely to
   accept the COVID-19 vaccines. However, those above 35 years old (OR =
   0.376, 95CI\% = 0.233-0.607, p < .001) and employed participants (OR =
   0.542, 95CI\% = 0.405-0.725, p < .001) were less likely to accept the
   COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, participants who believed that there was a
   conspiracy behind COVID-19 (OR = 0.502, 95CI\% = 0.356-0.709, p < .001)
   and those who do not trust any source of information on COVID-19
   vaccines (OR = 0.271, 95CI\% = 0.183-0.400, p < .001), were less likely
   to have acceptance towards them. The most trusted sources of information
   on COVID-19 vaccines were healthcare providers. Systematic interventions
   are required by public health authorities to reduce the levels of
   vaccines' hesitancy and improve their acceptance. We believe these
   results and specifically the low rate of acceptability is alarming to
   Jordanian health authorities and should stir further studies on the root
   causes and the need of awareness campaigns. These interventions should
   take the form of reviving the trust in national health authorities and
   structured awareness campaigns that offer transparent information about
   the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and the technology that was
   utilized in their production.},

Abstract = {The increasing restructuring of health care into managed care
   organizations (MCOs) offers new opportunities for rethinking public
   health strategies and initiatives in sexually transmitted disease (STD)
   control. Managed care organizations offer an important organizational
   network through which STD prevention initiatives can be deployed. A
   major barrier is the need for an information technology infrastructure
   to link thousands of providers, many in small groups or sole proprietor
   offices, to the centralized databases of large network model MCOs.
   Internet/intranet technology and electronic medical records represent
   important developments that could expand the capacity of MCOs to meet
   these needs.},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: Adolescents have the highest sexually
   transmitted disease (STD) incidence and are often hard to reach with
   preventive services, Fourteen youth-focused projects were funded by the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1994 through 1995 to pilot
   innovative, locally relevant, locally acceptable approaches; expand the
   range and accessibility of services beyond clinic-based facilities; and
   stimulate increased commitment of local resources.
   Design: Review and synthesis of 14 youth-focused, innovative projects.
   Results: Most projects undertook multiple interventions (11/14) in
   multiple venues (9/14), The majority (9/14) incorporated behavioral
   interventions, and half offered clinical services in nontraditional
   settings such as detention facilities, schools, parks, and parking lots.
   Six projects used peer volunteers; four worked with community
   coalitions. Most (12/14) obtained local resources, Where assessed,
   parental support was strong for providing STD prevention services,
   Conclusions: These projects increased the access and range of services
   available to a substantial number of high-risk youth with high STD
   rates. However, sustaining and scaling-up pilot project activities will
   be resource intensive. Increased financial and training support to
   augment evaluation capacity will be critical for innovation to become an
   integral part of STD prevention programs.},

Abstract = {The authors examine the patterns of concealment of illegal activities in
   human trafficking and slave labor use, as well as patterns of the
   activities of law enforcement agencies in the disclosure and
   investigation of the analyzed crimes. The aim of the article is to
   substantiate the data on the concealment of the investigated crimes for
   their subsequent use in the disclosure and investigation of the analyzed
   illegal activity. In the research, the authors used legal, sociological
   and other methods of scientific knowledge: logical, comparative legal,
   statistical, modeling, and a number of others. The authors relied on the
   materials of 130 criminal cases on encroachments on human trafficking
   and slave labor use, the results of interviewing 320 law enforcement
   officers, scientific developments of other researchers on the issue
   under consideration, as well as statistical data from the Main
   International and Analytical Center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs
   of Russia and the Judicial Department at the Supreme Court of the
   Russian Federation. The study of the materials of criminal cases shows
   that the basis for the disclosure and investigation of perpetrators'
   criminal activities should be based on the regularities of the method of
   concealing the crimes under consideration reflected in the following
   typical forms: (1) concealment of the fact and traces of preparation for
   committing a crime: a) placing veiled ads with offers of employment,
   training, marriage services in the media, social networks, leaflets,
   etc.; b) holding fake ``beauty contests{''}, ``draw games{''}, and
   similar events, participants of which are offered work or study abroad;
   c) disseminating deliberately false information in order to attract
   future victims of slave trade and illegal exploitation in certain social
   groups: prostitutes, drug addicts, unemployed, homeless people, etc.; d)
   conspiring in finding accomplices, means of communication, places of
   detention of victims, means of physical and psychological pressure on
   the victim; (2) conspiracy of the direct commission of a crime: a)
   disguising it as legitimate; b) falsifying documents that allow victims
   to travel abroad; c) concealing places of detention of victims and
   organizing victim safe-keeping; d) seizing identity documents from
   victims; e) using SIM cards registered to unauthorized persons, f)
   veiled advertising of activities to search for consumers of sexual and
   other services; (3) disguise or destruction of traces of the committed
   crime: destruction of clothing and belongings of the victim, erasing the
   traces left. Thus, in the course of the analysis of the literature and
   criminal case materials on human trafficking and slave labor use,
   forensically significant data on the concealment of the investigated
   crimes},

Abstract = {Leniency policies offering immunity to the first cartel member that
   blows the whistle and self-reports to the antitrust authority have
   become the main instrument in the fight against price-fixing
   conspiracies around the world. In public procurement markets, however,
   bid-rigging schemes are often accompanied by corruption of public
   officials. In the absence of coordinated forms of leniency (or rewards)
   for unveiling corruption, a policy offering immunity from antitrust
   sanctions may not be sufficient to encourage wrongdoers to blow the
   whistle, as the leniency recipient will then be exposed to the risk of
   conviction for corruption. This article assesses the extent of this
   problem by describing and discussing the antitrust and anti-corruption
   provisions present in a few selected countries, under both common law
   and civil law regimes. For each of these countries, we try to evaluate
   whether the legal system presents any solution to limiting the risk that
   legal provisions against corruption undermine the effectiveness of
   leniency programs against bid rigging in public procurement. Legal
   harmonization, coordination, and co-operation on procedural and
   substantive issues, and inter- and intra-jurisdictions, seem essential
   to solve this problem. Given the size of public procurement markets and
   their propensity for cartelization, specific improvements in legislation
   appear necessary in all the countries considered. Explicitly introducing
   leniency policies for corruption, as has been done recently in Brazil
   and Mexico and is being experimented in the United States, is only a
   first step. The antitrust experience has taught us that to achieve their
   goals of inducing whistleblowing, these policies must be carefully
   designed and sufficiently generous with (only) the first reporting
   party, they should not be discretional, they must be backed by robust
   sanctions, and they must be consistently implemented. Hence, the road
   ahead appears a long one. To increase the effectiveness of leniency in
   multiple offense cases, we suggest, besides extending automatic leniency
   to individual criminal sanctions, the creation of a ``one-stop point{''}
   enabling firms and individuals to report different crimes simultaneously
   and receive leniency for all of them at once if they are entitled to it.
   As long as individual criminal charges are not covered by a coordinated
   and nondiscretional leniency program, there is little hope that these
   provisions will induce any improvement in the fight against corrupting
   cartels. A more effective way to fight such cartels may then be offering
   Qui Tam rewards to nonaccomplice whistleblowers, as is already done with
   apparent success by several law enforcement agencies in the United
   States.},

Title = {The Philosophical Counseling of ``the Cloud of Unknowing{''}},
Journal = {UNIVERSITAS-MONTHLY REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {3-18},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Almost all writings on philosophical practice and philosophical
   counseling in recent times mention the steps and methods that are
   related to spirituality, such as contemplation and equilibrium as part
   of Peace, transcendence as part of FITT, ``beyond{''} as part of the
   ``Beyond-Method{''} Method, along with spiritual moving and ascendance
   as part of CISA; all these consider spirituality as the final stage of
   counseling. In this regard, philosophical counseling is far from
   psychological counseling, most of which concerns behaviors and emotions
   while philosophical counseling is mostly about values or spirituality.
   Spirituality describes not only one's inward demand but also explicates
   that the subjects of spirituality include subjects from both the natural
   and the supernatural worlds. Therefore, spirituality could mean the
   following things: first, spirit; second, intelligence; third, religious
   understanding; fourth, soul; and fifth, the intelligence possessed by
   animals after they are tamed. However, the first four meanings belong to
   the area of philosophical counseling and would be discussed in the
   context of western philosophy.
   The inquiry about spirituality flourished in the medieval age, with all
   kinds of doctrines and methods emerging, which showed the richness of
   spiritual cultivation. Among others, the most remarkable feature was the
   difference between stability and mendicant, that is, the distinction
   between contemplation and service. However, for most practitioners and
   scholars, only the coordination in between was appropriate. Thomas
   Aquinas believed that the perfect lifestyle for a Christian was
   developing contemplation and service side by side, as he said,
   ``comtemplata aliis tradere.{''} Therefore, spiritual cultivation and
   secular life are not in any conflicts, as Pope Francis said, ``as
   priests, we tend to make believers moresacred, while believers many but
   not all of them beg us to make them more sacred, because it's more
   comfortable serving in church than believing in the Lord in everyday
   lives. We don't have to fall into this trap, since it's a sinful
   conspiracy.{''} Priests and believers have their respective methods but
   serve one and the same purpose, and their methods are equally effective.
   In the fourteenth century, the development of spirituality was more or
   less mystical and written in vernaculars. In terms of districts, there
   were Rhineland Mysticism, Flemish Mysticism, and Unknowing Mysticism,
   respectively represented by Master Eckhart, Jan van Ruusbroce and The
   Cloud of Unknowing.
   The Cloud of Unknowing is reported to be authored by an English man who
   was either a priest or a man profound in cultural literacy and high in
   ranks, and his book was intended not to lead strangers into spirituality
   but to pave the steps forward for whose who were spiritually cultivated
   and prepared.},

Title = {TOMSK PROVINCE SOCIALISTS-REVOLUTIONARIES IN THE DOCUMENTS AND MATERIALS
   OF THE SIBERIAN BODIES OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN EXTRAORDINARY COMMISSION
   DURING 1920-1921},
Journal = {TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Number = {409},
Pages = {41-46},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The article first presents the activity of the right social
   revolutionaries in Tomsk Province after the restoration of the Soviet
   power in Siberia during 1919-1921. The position of the provincial body
   of the Socialist Revolutionary Party before and after its transition to
   the illegal status is described on the basis of the documents and
   materials included in the disposal of the Siberian All-Russian
   Extraordinary Commission authorities. The publication illustrates the
   main activities of the right social revolutionaries during 19201921, as
   well as the forms and methods of their work among various social groups.
   An effort was undertaken to assess the influence of right socialist
   revolutionaries on the social and political life of the province.
   Comparing the reports of different departments of the Cheka bodies,
   private information letters of the Russian Communist Party of the
   Bolsheviks organizations and some Socialist Revolutionary Party
   documents allow reconstructing the picture of the right social
   revolutionaries during their underground activities in Tomsk Province.
   The analysis of these sources, including comparative, structural and
   logical methods of research, allowed receiving new information regarding
   the organizational structure, the composition parameters of the
   revolutionary organizations in that period. The study of the materials
   shows that the Bolshevik authorities did not initially volunteer to
   cooperate with the socialist opposition and initiated a number of
   measures restricting and then suppressing activities of the social
   revolutionary rights on the territory of Tomsk Province. The author
   provides information showing that the local bodies of the All-Russian
   Extraordinary Commission had sufficiently detailed information about the
   illegal activities of socialist revolutionaries, with the exception of
   intra-party information. Conspiracy of Socialists-Revolutionaries
   significantly complicated the work of the Cheka bodies, forcing chekists
   and their confidential colleagues to provide unverified and sometimes
   false information, exaggerating the scale of work and the real influence
   of the right social revolutionaries. Regular information of the party
   structures of the Russian Communist Party of the Bolsheviks, of the
   local All-Russian Extraordinary Commission does not confirm the widely
   organized social revolutionaries among the population. The author
   concludes that illegal activities of the Socialists-Revolutionaries in
   Tomsk Province during 1920-1921 were primarily episodic in nature and
   did not represent special danger for the dominant Bolshevik regime. The
   activities of the right socialists-revolutionaries activated noticeably
   with the beginning of the new economic policy, prompting the Soviet
   party authorities and the local structures of the Cheka bodies to
   implement punitive measures that effectively paralyzed the activities of
   the few right social revolutionary organizations on the territory of
   Tomsk Province.},

Abstract = {This study uses quantitative methods to explore how the memory of Katyn
   is mobilised in political discourse. The scholarly literature on memory
   conflict tends to see international memory disputes as an expression of
   a state's interests as a whole; this study analyses when hostile
   rhetoric is mobilised and finds that in Poland Katyn is invoked as part
   of an opposition strategy that criticises the incumbent regime for
   undermining the national interest. Periods of accelerated debate about
   the significance of Katyn have occurred as political elites sought to
   achieve specific domestic rather than foreign political goals.},

Title = {A qualitative insight into the perceptions and COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy among Pakistani pharmacists},

Abstract = {A qualitative exploration of pharmacists' perceptions regarding COVID-19
   conspiracies and their willingness to get vaccinated. A semi-structured
   questionnaire guide was developed using ground theory to conduct
   in-depth interviews. A total of 36 participants gave consent for an
   audio-recorded interview. Results have shown that most of the
   respondents believed that SARS-CoV-2 is a natural virus, not man-made,
   that causes a disease just like other viruses and it is absurd to
   believe that the vaccine is being used by foreign powers for the
   implantation of microchips just to control humans. A general opinion
   thatwhich reflected from the in-depth interview is that the
   pharmaceutical companies may be hiding some important information on
   COVID-19 to promote the sale of their product. Some doubts on the
   reliability and trustworthiness on the COVID-19 vaccine safety and
   efficacy data were noticed among the respondents. Factors leading to
   COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were adverse reaction, cost of COVID-19
   vaccine, and limited data on safety and efficacy profile of COVID-19
   vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among health professionals is a
   major hindrance to our current fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Findings
   of this study are alarming, and the stakeholders must consider this
   ongoing vaccination campaign as an opportunity to formulate a mechanism
   to ensure high vaccination rate among general public and healthcare
   providers in Pakistan. What was already known? According to World Health
   Organization (WHO), vaccine hesitancy is one of the ten major threats to
   global healthcare system and it is a major barrier to achieve herd
   immunity around the globe. Pakistan has begun vaccinating its people in
   a systematic phase-wise manner under which the healthcare workers and
   elderly people are prioritized for vaccination. Previous experience
   tells us that vaccine hesitancy is a major problem in Pakistan and it is
   better to understand perceptions of pharmacists about COVID-19 vaccine
   who are the primary source of information for most of general
   population. What this study adds: This study is first of its kind to
   explore vaccine hesitancy among Pakistani pharmacists and the results of
   this study show that majority of the participants were willing to get
   COVID-19 vaccine and few of them have even got themselves vaccinated at
   the start of vaccination campaign. Many among the willing participants
   considered cost of vaccine, adverse reactions, limited data, safety, and
   efficacy as major hindrance to their decision to get vaccine. Few
   participants were found highly vaccine-hesitant because of their staunch
   belief in the prevalent myths and rumors about COVID-19 vaccine.},

Title = {``EACH SINGLE GESTURE BECOMES A DESTINY{''}: GESTURALITY BETWEEN CINEMA
   AND PAINTING IN RAUL RUIZ'S <i>L</i>'<i>HYPOTHESE DU</i> <i>TABLEAU
   VOLE</i>},
Journal = {CINEMA-JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE MOVING IMAGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {27+},
Abstract = {With a chiastic flourish, the Collectionneur of Raul Ruiz's 1978 film
   essay L'Hypothese du tableau vole rises to his feet, points definitively
   towards the frame and, with rising intonation, signals that unlike a
   painting, the tableau vivant reveals in its motility what a static
   painting cannot. The self-reflexive delivery, and the grandiosity of his
   gesture, indicate that the same gift has been bestowed upon cinema.
   While the ensuing narrative may portray him as an isolated eccentric,
   his words and actions speak to a long-held fascination with the relative
   capacities of painting and cinema when it comes to capturing gesture.
   Both cinema and painting can lay claim to an indexical intimacy with
   gesture: when we look at a painting we can discern the individual
   gestures of the artist's hand which brought it into being. At the same
   time, cinematographic arts allow the gestures themselves to be displayed
   onscreen, although the apparatus which captures them is mechanical. In
   his foundational 1992 essay ``Notes on Gesture{''}, Agamben explicitly
   cites painting as a medium which is gesturally inferior to cinema:
   ``Even the Mona Lisa, even Las Meninas could be seen not as immovable
   and eternal forms, but as fragments of a gesture or as stills of a lost
   film wherein only they would regain their true meaning.{''} This study
   will show that it is not singularly in cinema or in painting that pure
   gesturality might be found, but rather in intermedial spaces such as
   those opened up by the interactions between cinema and painting.
   Ruiz lures the viewer into searching for clues to solve the conspiracy
   around the paintings by scanning for the smallest movements onscreen.
   The reconstruction of the paintings as tableaux vivants allows the
   gestures to be interpolated between stillness and movement, between
   fiction and reality, between paint and the moving image. The tableau
   vivant constitutes an attempt to halt gesturality between two media, to
   interrupt its ceaseless mediation and discern some deeper meaning
   through an enhanced interstitial perspective and by perceiving the
   movements of both the figures in the painting and the actors, who cannot
   help but tremble as they hold their poses.
   This study will explore techniques of anamorphosis, Diderotian dialogue
   and elliptical production design to observe how cinema and painting
   gesture towards each other. The opportunity to combine close scene
   analyses with more abstract forays into psychoanalysis and art history
   is a luxury afforded by these kinds of interstitial considerations.
   Gesturality beckons, but as we approach it we cannot help but re-enact
   its ceremony and gesture towards or beyond ourselves.},

Title = {Mary `of Alania', Anna Komnene, and the Revival of Aristotelianism in
   Byzantium},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {75},

Pages = {123-163},
Abstract = {Mary of Alania, though Georgian born, was the centre of a circle of
   literati in Constantinople during the early years of the reign of
   Alexios I. The court of her first husband, Michael VII Doukas, had seen
   the revival of an interest in philosophy and natural science, with
   renewed study of both Plato and Aristotle and works composed for the
   emperor and court on philosophical and scientific topics by scholars
   such as Psellos, John Italos and Symeon Seth. Following this interest in
   natural science, including meteorology, in the 1070s, Mary continued
   such studies at her own court at the Mangana Palace, where she
   commissioned works not only on theology from Theophylact, but on natural
   science from Eustratios of Nicaea, who may have succeeded Theophylact as
   tutor to her son Constantine Doukas. Eustratios' piece, in fact, appears
   to be one of a series on meteorological topics composed for the empress.
   This paper argues that, as the betrothed of Constantine Doukas, Anna
   Komnene gained her interest in intellectual pursuits from Mary, with
   whom she lived for several years as a girl, and that Mary's interests
   played a part in shaping Anna's, even though Anna concentrated primarily
   on literature and philosophy, rather than the theology and natural
   science which is known to have interested Mary. Anna was to play a key
   role in the revival of Aristotelian scholarship, as patron of a circle
   of scholars working on commentaries on Aristotle, Plato, Euclid and
   Ptolemy, a circle which included Eustratios, and her dedication to
   scholarship may have arisen from her upbringing in the household of an
   imperial woman who was genuinely interested in intellectual pursuits.
   Apart from her taste for learning, Anna's attitude towards power may
   also have been influenced by the involvement of Mary in the plot of
   Nikephoros Diogenes against Alexios, with the hope of reinstating
   Constantine to the place in the imperial succession which he had lost
   after the birth of Anna's brother John. In her laments over her fiance
   Anna may have been regretting the failure of this conspiracy, as much as
   she did her loss of status after the death of her father and accession
   of her brother. She never forgot that she had been betrothed to an
   emperor-designate and Tornikes' Funeral Oration consoles her for the
   death of Constantine, to whom she had been betrothed some 60 years
   earlier, and her loss of imperial rank as a deliberate act of Divine
   Providence which allowed her to devote herself instead to scholarship,
   which had in the interim become so important a part of her
   self-identity.},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: The development and introduction of nucleic
   acid amplification (NAA) tests by commercial sources has improved our
   ability to diagnose chlamydial infections and other sexually transmitted
   diseases (STDs), A review of approaches to diagnosing STDs can provide a
   clearer picture of the present needs,
   Goals: To review the advantage and disadvantages of current and future
   diagnostic approaches.
   Study Design: Survey the literature and define current and future needs
   in developed and developing country settings.
   Results: The increase in analytical sensitivity afforded by NAA has
   enabled the use of noninvasive specimens, such as first-void urine (FVU)
   and self-obtained vaginal swabs, for diagnostic testing and screening
   asymptomatic low-prevalence populations and hard-to-access populations,
   This technology allows multiplexing in which targets from multiple
   agents responsible for a particular syndrome can be amplified and
   detected, Although NAA tests have been designed to minimize
   contamination, there is some reluctance to replace less sensitive tests
   with this new technology, The concerns involve potential false positive
   and false negative results caused by the presence of inhibitors, even
   though the rates of false results are low, Other concerns are cost,
   through-put, hands-on time, and time necessary for results.
   Conclusions: Nucleic acid amplification tests are a great improvement
   and additional tests are needed for the diagnosis of STDs at the point
   of first encounter, with minimal delay between diagnosis and treatment.
   Affordable tests, which are rapid, sensitive, and specific are needed
   for use in resource-limited settings where most STDs are seen; this has
   been a major undertaking for the Sexually Transmitted Diseases
   Diagnostics Initiative.},

   history of filibusterism. How did these soldiers of fortune and
   partisans of liberty, who exported revolution from the newly United
   States to the American territories of Spain, France, England, and the
   Native Nations communicate with their adversaries and partisans both
   publicly and in secret? The author shows how the texts associated with
   the founding of the United States were the model for manuscript writing,
   the press, and verbal rumor. He discovers that the operative binary for
   these adventurers' appropriation of communication forms was not
   public-private, but public-secret.},

Title = {The heroes of the 1991 August Coup: Glimpses of the portrait of Dmitry
   Yazov, a member of the State Committee on the State of Emergency},
Journal = {TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Number = {483},
Pages = {145-150},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The article is dedicated to the thirtieth anniversary of the events
   called the 1991 August Coup and regarded as an attempt of a takeover.
   One of its key participants was Dmitry Timofeevich Yazov, the last
   Marshal of the Soviet Union. The article presents Yazov's opinion on the
   causes and nature of the actions of members of the State Committee on
   the State of Emergency and also a description of the situation by the
   employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Soviet
   Federative Socialist Republic who took part in the so-called release of
   Mikhail Gorbachev and the arrest of state leaders accused of attempting
   a conspiracy to remove him from the post of the president of the USSR.
   Taking into account evaluations given by representatives of the two
   opposite ``sides{''} of the conflict, the author traces the changing
   perception of the domestic political events of that time. To solve the
   research problem, the author studied not only materials from various
   media and accessible normative documents, but also memories of real
   participants in the described confrontation. The mentioned sources,
   including the author's personal acquaintance with the main character of
   the article, determined to a great extent the novelty of the study. The
   formed data bank is quite representative to understand the indicated
   problem. The main methodological principles of the study are scientific
   objectivity and historicism. The specific events of Yazov's life are
   described in the context of political processes taking place in the
   country. Nevertheless, the main objective of the article is to reveal
   the identity of the prominent military leader against the background of
   the events of the August Coup and their influence on his subsequent
   life. He did not deny mistakes, but insisted that it did not affect his
   conscience and officer's honor. In the author's opinion, Yazov's most
   important conclusion regarding the events of August 1991 is that the
   idea of creating the State Committee on the State of Emergency was
   provoked by President Gorbachev himself. As for Boris Yeltsin, he only
   took an advantage of the situation in order to gain full power. This
   indirectly confirms the existence of problems in the formation of
   political and legal culture in the implementation of major state
   reforms. The material of the article can be useful to everyone who is
   interested in the latest history of Russia. It records little-known but
   important elements of the activities of statesmen and state bodies
   during one of the most acute political breaks in national history.},

Abstract = {In early 1474, almost ten years had elapsed since Matthias Corvinus'
   last and failed major anti-Ottoman attempt. The rather peculiar, given
   previous and later events and developments, Habsburg-Hunyadi `crusader'
   plan of 1466-1467 had ended in the Transylvanian rebellion and the
   ensuing Moldavian campaign of king Matthias. Over the next years, the
   king focused on his Bohemian and Habsburg problems and claims, while the
   crusader plans drafted in 1471 were once again basically brought to a
   halt by another conspiracy against John Hunyadi's son. Less than three
   years later, the Ottoman raid on Oradea (Nagyvarad, Grosswardein), as
   well as Venetian financial offers, compelled the king to re-take
   anti-Ottoman action. His unsuccessful negotiations with sultan Mehmed II
   (1472-1473), alongside the aid rendered during the Walachian-Moldavian
   conflict to Stephen III of Moldavia (1470/1471-1473), also brought back
   the king to the crusader frontline. While having to restore good
   connections to pope Sixtus IV, eager, in return to strengthen his
   Western credit by crusader actions and plans, Matthias Corvinus had also
   to deal with the Habsburg and Jagellonian attempts to weaken his
   position and diminish his influence in crusader matters too, in Hungary
   as well as in the neighboring areas.
   Newfound sources, namely Italian, Milanese in particular, archival data,
   provided the grounds for new perspectives on Matthias Corvinus' Ottoman
   and anti-Ottoman actions in the mid 1470'. They allow us to take a
   closer look at the chain of events, decisions, propaganda, rivalry and
   disinformation that led to the Habsburg-Jagellonian charges of `crusader
   incompetence' against Matthias Corvinus and also to the failure of the
   planned Hungarian-Moldavian `trap' for sultan Mehmed II in the second
   half of 1476. Most of the explanations for it can be looked up in the
   immediate political context, complicated by the anti-Ottoman Muslim
   talks, by Usun Hassan's failure, respectively by the conflicts between
   Tartar factions. Yet, as in many cases of similar nature, the main
   explanations usually rely on quite simple facts. The `anti-Ottoman'
   coalition of the mid 1470' consisted basically of former, more recent or
   traditional, rivals, such as the Rome, Venice, Hungary or Moldavia,
   which had a direct impact on the outcome of their crusader style
   attempts and actions. Another important aspect which should be
   emphasized in this context is the relation between Matthias and
   Transylvania after 1467, in connection to the local Transylvanian ties,
   via Walachia, with the Turk. Such structural details, beyond the various
   forms of modern, but also medieval, bias, have ensured an almost
   constant advantage to the Ottoman Empire, more and more a partner,
   rather than an enemy.},

Abstract = {There has been a growing literature among philosophers of education on
   how to frame questions of moral controversy in the classroom. Through
   the application of hard moral cases that may be said to leave one
   `morally dumbfounded', I take up Michael Hand's influential epistemic
   criterion and attempt to show why its monistic approach is too limited
   in its ability to capture the complexity of such moral dilemmas. Rather,
   I argue that the classroom requires a pluralist moral framework, as
   exemplified by the Moral Foundations Theory, developed by Jonathan
   Haidt. Not only does Moral Foundations Theory consider the liberal ethic
   of autonomy, it also extends consideration to the ethics of community
   and divinity, which is crucial for meeting the broader aims of moral and
   religious education, such as developing reason, identity and cultural
   understanding.},

   predictions on Twitter},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {The spread of misinformation on social media can lead to inappropriate
   behaviors that can make disasters worse. In our study, we focused on
   tweets containing misinformation about earthquake predictions and
   analyzed their dynamics. To this end, we retrieved 82,129 tweets over a
   period of 2 years (March 2020-March 2022) and hand-labeled 4157 tweets.
   We used RoBERTa to classify the complete dataset and analyzed the
   results. We found that (1) there are significantly more
   not-misinformation than misinformation tweets; (2) earthquake
   predictions are continuously present on Twitter with peaks after felt
   events; and (3) prediction misinformation tweets sometimes link or tag
   official earthquake notifications from credible sources. These insights
   indicate that official institutions present on social media should
   continuously address misinformation (even in quiet times when no event
   occurred), check that their institution is not tagged/linked in
   misinformation tweets, and provide authoritative sources that can be
   used to support their arguments against unfounded earthquake
   predictions.},

Abstract = {In light of technology that may reveal the content of a person's
   innermost thoughts, I address the question of whether there is a right
   to `brain privacy'-a right not to have one's inner thoughts revealed to
   others-even if exposing these thoughts might be beneficial to society. I
   draw on a conception of privacy as the ability to control who has access
   to information about oneself and to an account that connects one's
   interest in privacy to one's interests in (1) autonomy and associated
   reputational interests, and (2) preserving one's dignity. Focusing on
   the controversial case of Gilberto Valle, known as the `cannibal cop',
   who faced legal punishment and moral reproach for deeply disturbing
   thoughts of doing violence to women, thoughts he claimed were mere
   fantasies, I argue that Valle has a right to brain privacy if he has a
   legitimate privacy interest that is not outweighed by competing societal
   interests in avoiding harm. Our weighing of competing privacy and
   societal interests will depend on the magnitude of the privacy interests
   in autonomy and dignity, and on how reliable the technology used to
   expose inner thoughts is in predicting future harmful behavior and
   identifying true threats.},

Title = {THE MOTIVATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE SUBFIELD ``EVIL EYE, JINX{''} OF THE
   LEXICAL-SEMANTIC FIELD ``HARM{''} IN THE DIALECTS OF THE RUSSIAN
   LANGUAGE},
Journal = {TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Number = {427},
Pages = {47-54},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The article discusses the vocabulary of negative pragmatic evaluation
   with the meaning `evil eye, jinx' from the point of view of its
   semantic-motivational structure. The research was carried out on the
   material collected by the method of continuous samples from the
   dictionary of Russian folk dialects ( more than seven hundred lexical
   units). Basically, this is lexicon which has no correspondences in the
   literary language with the exception of the lexemes sglaz {[}evil eye],
   sglazit' {[}to hoodoo], porcha {[}jinx], portit' {[}to jinx] and their
   derivatives. After the analysis of the semantic structure and the
   identification of the motivational feature, the studied lexical units
   were separated into three main nomination models. The first model -
   ``evil eye, jinx <- to make) unfit, sick with a look evil eye){''} - is
   represented by derivatives from the roots glaz- {[}eye], glyad-
   {[}look], -zor- {[}see, watch], zep- {[}eye] cf. sglaz {[}evil eye],
   sglazit' {[}to hoodoo], poglyadka {[}evil eye], pereglyanut' {[}to bring
   misfortune], prizor {[}injury], oprizorit' {[}to hoodoo], ozep {[}evil
   eye], ozepat' {[}to jinx by evil thoughts], sozepit' {[}to hoodoo];
   izzevat' {[}to hoodoo], ozev {[}evil eye] with the original meaning `to
   watch with an open mouth', obokhat' {[}to hoodoo], podivit'sya {[}to
   hoodoo] and the original meaning `look with a surprise, a sigh', etc.).
   The second model - ``evil eye, jinx <- (make) unfit, sick by word, hex,
   conspiracy{''} - is mainly expressed by derivatives from the roots rek-
   {[}speech], rok- {[}speech], govor- {[}talk], zyk- {[}tongue], - sud-
   {[}discussion], etc. (vrek {[}evil eye], urekat' {[}to do harm], urok
   {[}jinx], urochit' {[}to jinx by unkind, envious eyes], izurochit' {[}to
   jinx by witchcraft, evil eye], otgovor {[}cause of disease and damage],
   ogovorit' {[}to do harm by word], ozykat' {[}to hoodoo], peresud {[}evil
   eye], etc.). The third model - ``evil eye, damage <- (make) unfit, sick
   by a special action (ritual), a mental message{''} - is represented by
   words with the meaning `to spoil (health, psyche) by the power of
   witchcraft'. This action is expressed by verbs with generalizing
   semantics and their derivatives (sdelat' {[}to do harm], popritchit'
   {[}to inflict harm], nasazhivat' {[}to send harm], pokhitit' {[}to do
   harm], poteryat' {[}to unleash harm], pogadit' {[}to make unfit],
   podumka {[}thinking of harm], etc.). The analysis shows that most of the
   dialectal units reflect the traditional culture representatives' faith
   in the effective, magical power of eyesight/look, speech/word, mental
   message, some actions interpreted as being able to harm the addressee,
   as a particular ritual-sorcery. Lexemes with the historical meaning
   `speak/speech' (urochit' {[}to jinx by unkind, envious eyes], etc.) have
   lost their connection with the original concept; and the meanings
   `hoodoo/evil eye' and `do harm', including in verbs with the broad
   semantics of action, are generalizing, `generic'.},

Title = {Misinformation in Italian Online Mental Health Communities During the
   COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Content Analysis Study},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: Social media platforms are widely used by people suffering
   from mental illnesses to cope with their conditions. One modality of
   coping with these conditions is navigating online communities where
   people can receive emotional support and informational advice. Benefits
   have been documented in terms of impact on health outcomes. However, the
   pitfalls are still unknown, as not all content is necessarily helpful or
   correct. Furthermore, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and related
   problems, such as worsening mental health symptoms, the dissemination of
   conspiracy narratives, and medical distrust, may have impacted these
   online communities. The situation in Italy is of particular interest,
   being the first Western country to experience a nationwide lockdown.
   Particularly during this challenging time, the beneficial role of
   community moderators with professional mental health expertise needs to
   be investigated in terms of uncovering misleading information and
   regulating communities.
   Objective: The aim of the proposed study is to investigate the
   potentially harmful content found in online communities for mental
   health symptoms in the Italian language. Besides descriptive information
   about the content that posts and comments address, this study aims to
   analyze the content from two viewpoints. The first one compares
   expert-led and peer-led communities, focusing on differences in
   misinformation. The second one unravels the impact of the COVID-19
   pandemic, not by merely investigating differences in topics but also by
   investigating the needs expressed by community members.
   Methods: A codebook for the content analysis of Facebook communities has
   been developed, and a content analysis will be conducted on bundles of
   posts. Among 14 Facebook groups that were interested in participating in
   this study, two groups were selected for analysis: one was being
   moderated by a health professional (n=12,058 members) and one was led by
   peers (n=5598 members). Utterances from 3 consecutive calendar years
   will be studied by comparing the months from before the pandemic, the
   months during the height of the pandemic, and the months during the
   postpandemic phase (2019-2021). This method permits the identification
   of different types of misinformation and the context in which they
   emerge. Ethical approval was obtained by the Universita della Svizzera
   italiana ethics committee.
   Results: The usability of the codebook was demonstrated with a pretest.
   Subsequently, 144 threads (1534 utterances) were coded by the two
   coders. Intercoder reliability was calculated on 293 units (19.10\% of
   the total sample; Krippendorff alpha=.94, range.72-1). Aside from a few
   analyses comparing bundles, individual utterances will constitute the
   unit of analysis in most cases.
   Conclusions: This content analysis will identify deleterious content
   found in online mental health support groups, the potential role of
   moderators in uncovering misleading information, and the impact of
   COVID-19 on the content.},

Abstract = {Neither courts nor scholars have articulated a coherent theory of the
   scope of the First Amendment's ``freedom of speech.{''} Most First
   Amendment jurisprudence and scholarship has focused on the justification
   for the freedom of speech or questions of constitutional
   protection-essentially, how much scrutiny should apply in various
   contexts. Largely ignored is the often-dispositive threshold question of
   whether activities are ``covered{''} by the First Amendment at all. Many
   activities that are colloquially considered ``speech{''} are not
   traditionally subject to constitutional review. For instance, the
   regulation of contracts, commercial fraud, perjury, conspiracy,
   workplace harassment, the compelled speech of tax returns, and large
   swaths of regulation by the administrative state have all historically
   been treated as beyond the ambit of the First Amendment.
   Today, however, the boundaries of the First Amendment are in a period of
   transformation. Plaintiffs across the country contend that the
   regulation of areas of social and economic life that never before were
   thought relevant to the Constitution is in violation of it. Courts are
   increasingly confronted with cases that raise the question: Does the
   First Amendment apply? This makes the need for a theory of the scope of
   the right of free speech-of the First Amendment's boundaries-ever more
   pressing.
   This Article develops, first, a descriptive and sociologically-based
   theory of First Amendment coverage. By analyzing differences between
   free speech sub-doctrines, I argue that the animating difference between
   what falls within the First Amendment's reach and what is excluded from
   it does not rest on the distinction between speech and conduct, as is
   often thought. Instead, coverage depends on whether or not social norms
   about a given practice are (or courts believe should be) sufficiently
   strong to make the anticipated consequences of the speech-how it works
   and what it does-clear. Coverage depends, in short, on whether or not
   the audience of the activity is pluralistic.
   Second, this Article develops a prescriptive theory of how courts should
   analyze questions of the boundaries of free speech. I argue that, at the
   borders of the First Amendment, courts must analyze the social context
   of the activity in question as well as the normative and institutional
   implications of charting First Amendment coverage.
   I conclude by exploring the issues at stake in current and emerging
   First Amendment coverage questions. I argue that the scope of the First
   Amendment reflects and defines the areas of social life in which we need
   or want cohesive, non-pluralistic, social norms and relationships. In
   short, the boundaries of the First Amendment track not only the space of
   pluralistic contestation, but also the expectation of and desire for
   social cohesion.},

Abstract = {Alfred Russel Wallace was a self-taught (he left school at 13) British
   naturalist, a self-described ``beetle collector{''} who explored 4 years
   in the Amazon and 8 years in Southeast Asia. During his Asian sojourn in
   the mid-nineteenth century he covered some 22,500 km through territories
   which are now Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Wallace made his
   voyages without formal government support, without a floating base camp
   (like Charles Darwin had with HMS Beagle), without infrastructure, and
   without much cash. During his epic journey Wallace caught, skinned and
   pickled 125,660 specimens of ``natural productions{''} including 212 new
   species of birds, 900 new species of beetles and 200 new species of
   ants. Consider just the logistics how could one man, on a tight budget
   and without organizational support, often living rough in rainforests,
   collect, identify, mount, preserve and transport 8,000 bird skins and
   100,000 insects? If Wallace did nothing more than collect and identify
   new species he would have left an important scientific legacy. But the
   breadth of his interests raised him to the top tier of scientists. His
   travels through the Malay Archipelago, supported by his knowledge of
   geology, helped him develop his understanding of the dynamics of island
   biology. He observed that the ``natural productions{''} he found in
   western Indonesia and Peninsular Malaysia were different to those in
   eastern Indonesia, due to changing sea levels and a combination of
   shallow seas and deep oceanic trenches. By studying these differences he
   developed a west-east boundary which came to be known as the ``Wallace
   Line,{''} the dividing point between (western) Southeast Asian fauna
   (elephants, tigers, monkeys and apes, hornbills) and fauna of the
   (eastern) AustroMalayan realm (kangaroos, birds of paradise,
   marsupials). He campaigned against: vaccination, vivisection, ``flat
   earth,{''} gambling, foreign aid, welfare state, ``junk{''} food,
   sweatshops, ``red-tapism,{''} child labor, and women's labor in coal
   mines. He promoted: women's liberation, food and drug controls, income
   tax, labor unions, food stamps, and a minimum wage.
   And what led Wallace to develop his contributions to the theory of
   natural selection, first the Sarawak Law (written during the period he
   spent in Sarawak as the guest of the White Rajah of Sarawak, James
   Brooke), and then the famous Ternate Paper in which he outlined the
   concept ``the fittest would survive.{''}? Wallace sent the Ternate Paper
   to Charles Darwin (who up to that point had not published one word on
   evolution) and at that point the conspiracy theorists get involved. Did
   Darwin and Wallace arrive at their similar ideas independently? Did
   Wallace get sidelined in the quest for priority by the more prominent
   and well-placed Darwin?},

Title = {Uncovering the Reasons Behind COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in Serbia:
   Sentiment-Based Topic Modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {Background: Since the first COVID-19 vaccine appeared, there has been a
   growing tendency to automatically determine public attitudes toward it.
   In particular, it was important to find the reasons for vaccine
   hesitancy, since it was directly correlated with pandemic protraction.
   Natural language processing (NLP) and public health researchers have
   turned to social media (eg, Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook) for
   user-created content from which they can gauge public opinion on
   vaccination. To automatically process such content, they use a number of
   NLP techniques, most notably topic modeling. Topic modeling enables the
   automatic uncovering and grouping of hidden topics in the text. When
   applied to content that expresses a negative sentiment toward
   vaccination, it can give direct insight into the reasons for vaccine
   hesitancy.
   Objective: This study applies NLP methods to classify
   vaccination-related tweets by sentiment polarity and uncover the reasons
   for vaccine hesitancy among the negative tweets in the Serbian language.
   Methods: To study the attitudes and beliefs behind vaccine hesitancy, we
   collected 2 batches of tweets that mention some aspects of COVID-19
   vaccination. The first batch of 8817 tweets was manually annotated as
   either relevant or irrelevant regarding the COVID-19 vaccination
   sentiment, and then the relevant tweets were annotated as positive,
   negative, or neutral. We used the annotated tweets to train a sequential
   bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based
   classifier for 2 tweet classification tasks to augment this initial data
   set. The first classifier distinguished between relevant and irrelevant
   tweets. The second classifier used the relevant tweets and classified
   them as negative, positive, or neutral. This sequential classifier was
   used to annotate the second batch of tweets. The combined data sets
   resulted in 3286 tweets with a negative sentiment: 1770 (53.9\%) from
   the manually annotated data set and 1516 (46.1\%) as a result of
   automatic classification. Topic modeling methods (latent Dirichlet
   allocation {[}LDA] and nonnegative matrix factorization {[}NMF]) were
   applied using the 3286 preprocessed tweets to detect the reasons for
   vaccine hesitancy.
   Results: The relevance classifier achieved an F-score of 0.91 and 0.96
   for relevant and irrelevant tweets, respectively. The sentiment polarity
   classifier achieved an F-score of 0.87, 0.85, and 0.85 for negative,
   neutral, and positive sentiments, respectively. By summarizing the
   topics obtained in both models, we extracted 5 main groups of reasons
   for vaccine hesitancy: concern over vaccine side effects, concern over
   vaccine effectiveness, concern over insufficiently tested vaccines,
   mistrust of authorities, and conspiracy theories.
   Conclusions: This paper presents a combination of NLP methods applied to
   find the reasons for vaccine hesitancy in Serbia. Given these reasons,
   it is now possible to better understand the concerns of people regarding
   the vaccination process.},

Title = {THE ``PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION{''} AND THE NATIONAL SELF-DETERMINATION OF
   THE PEOPLES OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE},
Journal = {TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL},

Number = {425},
Pages = {59-65},

Abstract = {The key aim of the article is to answer two questions: (1) Why was the
   Russian peasant revolution headed by a party that oriented militantly to
   the West, hostile to the peasantry as a traditionalist force and aiming
   to accomplish the world proletarian revolution? (2) Why did the
   Bolsheviks manage to carry out political mobilization of the peoples of
   the national peripheries of the Russian Empire? In the interpretation of
   historical material, the author uses the methodology of social
   constructivism. As a result, the author comes to a conclusion that only
   the pragmatism of the leaders of the party, their conviction that Russia
   is only the first springboard of the world proletarian revolution, can
   explain the Bolshevik steps that contradicted their program, but led to
   mass political mobilization of the Russian peasantry and representatives
   of other peoples of Russia. Firstly, it is not so much about the Decree
   on Peace, although it was an expression of the aspirations of millions
   of ``peasants in greatcoats{''}, but rather about the Decree on the
   Land. It was important that this document fulfilled the age-old dream of
   the Russian peasant - ``black redistribution{''}, i.e. a fair division
   of the common land between those who work on it. It seems that this can
   explain the neutrality of the majority and even the active support of
   part of the peasantry of the new Bolshevik government and even of the
   ``war communism{''} policy, which, in turn, ensured victory in the Civil
   War. Secondly, it is also important to emphasize that a significant part
   of the indigenous population of the national borderlands was in
   solidarity with the fantastic plans of the Bolsheviks. The Civil War on
   the periphery of the Russian Empire was not perceived as a ``war of
   Russians with non-Russians{''}. By the majority of the population,
   despite the nationalist propaganda of local governments, it was
   perceived as a class war, like the war of the poor against the rich, the
   proletarians against property owners, property owners against those who
   wanted to own it. Moreover, the Bolsheviks, who used the idea of
   national self-determination to destroy the Russian Empire, after the
   seizure of power, did not hurry to recognize the independence and
   sovereignty of the states that emerged at the national periphery of the
   empire. They looked at this process of ``sovereignization{''} as a
   conspiracy of the national bourgeoisie, striving to retain domination
   over its workers and to isolate them from the revolutionary Russian
   proletariat. It seems that Russia's multinationality, the diversity of
   its ethnic and cultural ``landscape{''} largely determined the fact that
   the ideology of social modernization of the country was internationalist
   Bolshevism, not nationalism, as it occurred earlier in Western Europe.},

Title = {Twitter users' coping behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown: an
   analysis of tweets using mixed methods},

Abstract = {Purpose - Using data from Twitter, the purpose of this paper is to
   assess the coping behaviour and reactions of social media users in
   response to the initial days of the COVID-19-related lockdown in
   different parts of the world.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study follows the quasi-inductive
   approach which allows the development of pre-categories from other
   theories before the sampling and coding processes begin, for use in
   those processes. Data was extracted using relevant keywords from
   Twitter, and a sample was drawn from the Twitter data set to ensure the
   data is more manageable from a qualitative research standpoint and that
   meaningful interpretations can be drawn from the data analysis results.
   The data analysis is discussed in two parts: extraction and
   classification of data from Twitter using automated sentiment analysis;
   and qualitative data analysis of a smaller Twitter data sample.
   Findings - This study found that during the lockdown the majority of
   users on Twitter shared positive opinions towards the lockdown. The
   results also found that people are keeping themselves engaged and
   entertained. Governments around the world have also gained support from
   Twitter users. This is despite the hardships being faced by citizens.
   The authors also found a number of users expressing negative sentiments.
   The results also found that several users on Twitter were fence-sitters
   and their opinions and emotions could swing either way depending on how
   the pandemic progresses and what action is taken by governments around
   the world.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors add to the body of
   literature that has examined Twitter discussions around H1N1 using
   in-depth qualitative methods and conspiracy theories around COVID-19. In
   the long run, the government can help citizens develop routines that
   help the community adapt to a new dangerous environment - this has very
   effectively been shown in the context of wildfires in the context of
   disaster management. In the context of this research, the dominance of
   the positive themes within tweets is promising for policymakers and
   governments around the world. However, sentiments may wish to be
   monitored going forward as large-spikes in negative sentiment may
   highlight lockdown-fatigue.
   Social implications - The psychology of humans during a pandemic can
   have a profound impact on how COVID-19 shapes up, and this shall also
   include how people behave with other people and with the larger
   environment. Lockdowns are the opposite of what societies strive to
   achieve, i.e. socializing.
   Originality/value - This study is based on original Twitter data
   collected during the initial days of the COVID-19-induced lockdown. The
   topic of ``lockdowns{''} and the ``COVID-19{''} pandemic have not been
   studied together thus far. This study is highly topical.},

Title = {INTERPRETATION OF THE IMAGE OF PAUL I IN THE WRITINGS OF HISTORIANS OF
   THE SECOND HALF OF THE 19TH - BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURIES},
Journal = {TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of historical literature about
   Russian Emperor Paul I. Particular attention is paid to how the image of
   the monarch was modified during the second half of the 19th-beginning of
   the 21st centuries. It can not be said that the list of works on Paul I
   is great; nevertheless, pre-revolutionary, Soviet and modern Russian
   historians were studying the era of his reign. The interest of
   historical science in the personality and activity of the Russian
   emperor is due to the fact that the monarch is a rather controversial
   and ambiguous figure, which is indicated by his state activity, personal
   qualities and, moreover, his tragic death as a result of a conspiracy,
   due to which a comprehensive study of the period of Paul I's reign
   throughout the century was limited. The contingent of historians in this
   work is determined in accordance with the chronology: studies of
   pre-revolutionary (N. Schilder, E. Shumigorsky, K. Valishevsky), Soviet
   (M. Pokrovsky, N. Eidelman) and modern Russian (Yu. Sorokin, A.
   Bokhanov) researchers. Using the same historical sources published at
   the turn of the 20th century, historians interpret the image of the
   emperor differently, apparently based on a selective analysis of the
   works of memoir literature available to them. It must also be said that
   the image of the emperor presented by historians was influenced by the
   era in which their historical work was created-often the dominant
   ideology and general scientific tendencies made their own corrections.
   In this regard, it should be noted that historians come to different
   conclusions, and the image of the emperor developed from contradictory
   in pre-revolutionary works, unambiguously negative in the early Soviet
   period to positive in the works of modern Russian researchers. In their
   works historians present the most important, in their opinion, moments,
   describing both the personal qualities of the emperor, which undoubtedly
   influenced his state activity, and also characterizing the policy Paul I
   pursued. The analysis of historical literature in the second half of the
   nineteenth and the beginning of the 21st centuries, carried out in the
   article, makes it possible to state that the image of Emperor Paul I has
   changed markedly over the centuries. Using primarily memoir literature,
   pre-revolutionary, Soviet and modern Russian historians compiled various
   historical portraits of the monarch: in some, Paul I was incapable of
   governing the state, in others he was a far-sighted politician who set
   strategic goals for Russia. Such an evolution of the image of Pavel I is
   a reflection of the changes taking place and taking place in the public
   consciousness, enabling further ``completion{''} of the image of the
   monarch.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the issue of contestation between followers of New
   Age religion and official academic institutions (primarily
   archaeological ones). Their contestation is related to the attempts of
   some activists to redefine categories and hierarchies created by state
   actors. What is examined is how the discourses of two groups
   interrelate, using the example of appealing to academic discourse by
   alternative religiosity. Specific features of such interrelation are
   determined by two factors. Firstly, New Age religion is characterised by
   opposition to the official authoritative institutions. Secondly, due to
   secularisation and the loss of monopoly on the production of knowledge
   by religion, different religious groups appeal to science in order to
   legitimate their beliefs. This is the reason why this appeal to the
   archaeological data and elements of academic discourse turns out to be
   an important resource in creating the knowledge production industry. The
   appeal to science is based on the specific logic of `stigmatised
   knowledge'. While New Age religion followers as representatives of
   alternative knowledge have to appeal to science, they do it in a way
   that allows them to challenge the status of academy. Furthemore, in
   doing this they also legitimate their own status. As a result,
   alternative experts perform an imagined discussion with representatives
   of academic institutions. In this discussion, the alternative experts
   win because they falsely ascribe ideas to scholars that they do not
   actually hold. Rejecting the legitimate status of academic science,
   alternative experts at the same time reject categories that are credited
   to them by official institutions. Thus, New Age followers seek to go
   beyond the category `religion.},

Title = {Litigious paranoid delusion and vengeful acting out},
Journal = {EVOLUTION PSYCHIATRIQUE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {83},
Number = {2},
Pages = {251-273},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives. The present clinical research explores the underlying logic
   of litigious paranoid delusion, more specifically in its querulous and
   pseudo-altruistic forms. This research examines both the causality and
   the psychic functions fulfilled by episodes of vengeful acting out and
   in some cases murder.
   Methodology. The author uses texts from the French psychiatric
   literature on the subject of litigious delusion, calling on Jacques
   Lacan's contributions to the structure of psychosis in order to analyze
   clinical situations, and using case studies in order to highlight the
   particularities of this form of persecution delusion.
   Results. Litigious paranoid delusion is constructed from the loss,
   whether real or experienced as such, of an object. Delusional
   litigation, in psychosis, results from a feeling of being deprived of
   jouissance, which persecutes the subject as a consequence of the
   non-symbolization of the castration of which that he sees himself as the
   victim. He is the target of a scandalous conspiracy threatening his
   image and aiming to dispossess him of it. One possible outcome is a
   querulant procedure, and this carries the particularity of referring
   directly to the right to jouissance. The same logic sustains episodes of
   avengful acting out: by resorting to action, the subject calls on the
   law for it to respond to the fundamental injustice threatening the
   subject's jouissance and his high representations of himself. Murderous
   acting out, as well as simulacrums of mass attacks, derive from a
   pseudo-altruistic litigious delusion and possess the common function of
   defending the ideal to which the subject adjusts his existence.
   Discussion. Through the analysis of paranoid litigious delusion and the
   auto-therapeutic solution it constitutes, the present article refutes
   any negative analysis of psychosis as a deficit. Unlike criminology
   studies, which, by establishing of profiles and statistics, objectify
   murder and murderers, the present article studies the status, the
   function and the causality of the act according to the perpetrator's
   psychic economy, in order to identify significant coordinates and the
   underlying subjective logic. Therefore, this contribution is an
   essential complement to today's psychological, psychiatric and forensic
   approaches to revengeful acting out and litigious paranoid delusion. In
   fact, this is a clinical category that is neglected or has even fallen
   into disuse.
   Conclusion. Clinical reflection is required regarding those we commonly
   see as justice idealists with synthetic tendencies, social reformers and
   the socio-political or religious doctrines they elaborate and act upon
   in the name of an ideal within the existing social fabric, sometimes at
   the cost of crimes against humanity. At the same time the following
   question is raised: how does the normalisation of litigious and
   querulous delusion accommodate the characteristics of contemporary
   social bonds. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Impact of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation on Social Media Virality:
   Content Analysis of Message Themes and Writing Strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Background: Vaccines serve an integral role in containing pandemics, yet
   vaccine hesitancy is prevalent globally. One key reason for this
   hesitancy is the pervasiveness of misinformation on social media.
   Although considerable research attention has been drawn to how exposure
   to misinformation is closely associated with vaccine hesitancy, little
   scholarly attention has been given to the investigation or robust
   theorizing of the various content themes pertaining to antivaccine
   misinformation about COVID-19 and the writing strategies in which these
   content themes are manifested. Virality of such content on social media
   exhibited in the form of comments, shares, and reactions has practical
   implications for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.
   Objective: We investigated whether there were differences in the content
   themes and writing strategies used to disseminate antivaccine
   misinformation about COVID-19 and their impact on virality on social
   media.
   Methods: We constructed an antivaccine misinformation database from
   major social media platforms during September 2019-August 2021 to
   examine how misinformation exhibited in the form of content themes and
   how these themes manifested in writing were associated with virality in
   terms of likes, comments, and shares. Antivaccine misinformation was
   retrieved from two globally leading and widely cited fake news
   databases, COVID Global Misinformation Dashboard and International
   Fact-Checking Network Corona Virus Facts Alliance Database, which aim to
   track and debunk COVID-19 misinformation. We primarily focused on 140
   Facebook posts, since most antivaccine misinformation posts on COVID-19
   were found on Facebook. We then employed quantitative content analysis
   to examine the content themes (ie, safety concerns, conspiracy theories,
   efficacy concerns) and manifestation strategies of misinformation (ie,
   mimicking of news and scientific reports in terms of the format and
   language features, use of a conversational style, use of amplification)
   in these posts and their association with virality of misinformation in
   the form of likes, comments, and shares.
   Results: Our study revealed that safety concern was the most prominent
   content theme and a negative predictor of likes and shares. Regarding
   the writing strategies manifested in content themes, a conversational
   style and mimicking of news and scientific reports via the format and
   language features were frequently employed in COVID-19 antivaccine
   misinformation, with the latter being a positive predictor of likes.
   Conclusions: This study contributes to a richer research-informed
   understanding of which concerns about content theme and manifestation
   strategy need to be countered on antivaccine misinformation circulating
   on social media so that accurate information on COVID-19 vaccines can be
   disseminated to the public, ultimately reducing vaccine hesitancy. The
   liking of COVID-19 antivaccine posts that employ language features to
   mimic news or scientific reports is perturbing since a large audience
   can be reached on social media, potentially exacerbating the spread of
   misinformation and hampering global efforts to combat the virus.},

Abstract = {After the effects of bloody dictatorship that whipped the region,
   Argentina as many other Latin American countries experienced a great
   trauma which not only altered the ways politics was lived, but also
   undermined the social trust of citizens respecting to their
   institutions. The rise of Kirchneristes and Kirchnerismo post stock and
   market crisis of 2001, initiated a new age in Argentina. Kirchnerismo
   opened the doors for the vindication of many claims of human right
   organisations, but at the same time, the discourse of human rights was
   adjusted to the interests of Cristina Kirchner and her followers. As a
   result of this, the cause of human rights allowed government to produce
   a new way of making politics where the concept of reality is altered
   according to textual connotations, which produces a gap between the
   sense of reality and citizenry.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on two novels by Vladimir Sharov, Staraia devochka
   (The Old Girl) and Voskreshenie Lazaria (The Resurrection of Lazarus),
   that address the Stalinist repressions of the 1930s. Through analysis of
   these novels, the article examines two interrelated aspects of Sharov's
   works: their representation of traumatic history and their postmodernist
   style. The paper then examines the way these features of Sharov's prose
   relate to broader, current cultural trends. Sharov's novels contain a
   synthetic view of history that unites such incompatible elements as
   Orthodox Christianity, a variety of charismatic sects, Bolshevik
   ideology, and Stalinism. Despite Sharov's unconventional view of the
   Soviet past, the article argues that there are parallels between the
   official, contemporary view of Soviet history and that represented in
   Sharov's fiction. Both depict Russian history as unique, separated from
   global historical processes.},

Title = {The Demise of the Dyatlov Group in Literary Mythology and Art: From
   Heroisation to Profanation of the Tragedy},
Journal = {QUAESTIO ROSSICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {612-628},
Abstract = {This article reviews the artistic adaptation of the tragedy which took
   place in the North Ural Mountains in 1959 involving the demise of Igor
   Dyatlov's group of hikers. The author refers to eight works of art,
   including novels, stories, TV shows, and films, released between 1966
   and 2020. This study is relevant as it reflects the need to analyse the
   reaction of art to a landmark event. No earlier attempts to analyse the
   works of art in question have been made. The author argues that
   Dyatlov's Pass is acquiring the status of a myth in artistic culture.
   The analysis is conducted chronologically in accordance with the release
   of the works of art. Without exception and for every text, the author
   analyses the content of the version of the tragedy and the peculiarity
   of its representation to reveal the work's aspiration to credibility and
   the message that seeks to create a perceptional response from the
   audience. The author reveals genre, content, and perception tendencies
   in the adaptation of the Ural myth. The way in which a work of art
   represents the event depends on the needs of the audience at a
   particular time in history. The author maintains that all the
   adaptations are meant for a mass audience. She also reconstructs the
   history of the function of the Dyatlov myth in popular literature over
   half a century. It is concluded that the artistic versions of the
   Dyatlov plot replace each other in accordance with a certain logic.
   Thus, the interpretation that is tragic and heroising and claims to be
   authentic is replaced by its opposite, i. e., one that is de-heroising.
   This in turn is replaced by the tragic concept of the doom of the human
   being in the face of irresistible forces, both natural and man-made:
   such is followed by ironic meta-reflection and commercial trash that
   turns tragedy into farce. At the current moment, the artistic
   development of this plot has a tragic heroic interpretation. It is
   proved that the logic of the changing trends of processing of the Ural
   myth is determined by the needs of a particular moment. In the 1960s,
   mass culture was driven by the goal of neutralising social tension in
   the face of the inexplicable. In the early 2000s, this culture was
   driven by expressing a fear of military and technological disasters and
   the strange manifestations of traumatised psyches. In the 2010s, the
   main factors behind mass culture were distrust in governments and
   intelligence agencies, as well as fear of the inexplicable mysteries of
   the universe: this has become, among other things, the basis of outright
   commercial speculation. The beginning of the new decade is once again
   marked by an attempt to calm public consciousness by means of a natural
   version that moves away from the conspiracy and man-made versions.},

Title = {THE KGB MEASURES AGAINST THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF THE RESTORED
   SELF-PUBLISHED MAGAZINE ``UKRAINSKYI VISNYK{''} UNDER THE UKRAINIAN SSR
   COUNCIL OF MINISTERS (THE MID - SECOND HALF OF THE 1970s)},
Journal = {SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN},

Pages = {200-212},
Abstract = {The purpose of the research is to study the Soviet regime reaction to
   the restoration of the magazine ``Ukrainskyi Visnyk{''}, the course and
   stages of repressive actions against its publishers; the main measures
   taken by the State Security Committee (KGB) to stop publishing the
   magazine. The Methodology of the Research. The methodological basis of
   the article is the principles of objectivity, comprehensiveness,
   continuity and historicism. The following methods have been used in this
   research: analysis and synthesis, problem chronological, retrospective,
   typology method, method of comparison and juxtaposition of information
   from different sources. The scientific novelty consists in the
   introduction of a complex of little-known documents of the Sectoral
   State Archive of the Security Service of Ukraine into scientific
   circulation, which give the opportunity to elucidate the essence of the
   Soviet regime repressive policy against the members of the editorial
   board of the restored magazine ``Ukrainskyi Visnyk{''} in the mid-second
   half of the 1970s. For the first time the article has provided a
   comprehensive analysis methods and the KGB measures in organizing
   repressions against the creators of the latest issues of the magazine.
   The Conclusion. In 1974 - 1975 the restoration of publishing the
   magazine ``Ukrainskyi Visnyk{''} by Stepan Khmara, Oles Shevchenko and
   Vitaliy Shevchenko was the evidence of continued activity of human
   rights protection by the Sixtiers dissidents after the ``general
   pogrom{''} of 1972 and caused a negative reaction of the Soviet
   leadership. In the mid-second half of the 1970s one of the key
   objectives of the KGB under the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian
   Soviet Socialist Republic was to identify the members of the magazine's
   editorial board and to punish them. At the same time, a wide range of
   unofficial, extrajudicial methods were used: the use of agents,
   ``external surveillance{''} services, secret searches, wiretapping of
   homes, secret reading of correspondence, ``preventive{''} measures, etc.
   The process of repression began with unsuccessful attempts to track down
   the magazine's editors (1974 - 1975), carried on during the operational
   work with its participants in the framework of the ``Blok{''} case (1975
   - 1978), and ended with the opening of a special case called ``Vydavtsi
   (The Publishers){''} (1978) and open judicial repressions against S.
   Khmara, O. Shevchenko and V. Shevchenko (1980). In 1975, in the course
   of investigation, it was possible to block sending Issue No. 9 of the
   ``Ukrainskyi Visnyk{''} abroad and to block publishing subsequent issues
   of the magazine. Although the use of judicial repression against the
   magazine's editors was delayed for years primarily due to the skillful
   use of conspiracy tactics by the dissidents. In the end, the harsh
   sentences against the members of the editorial board of the renewed
   ``Ukrainskyi Visnyk{''} proved the repressive essence of the Soviet
   regime and became the part of a large-scale wave of arrests against the
   Ukrainian dissident movement at the end of the 1970s - the beginning of
   the 80s, which was aimed at its complete suppression.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {CO2 is not a simple, immediately graspable substance like water, salt,
   or mercury. It has to be conceptually and instrumentally constructed
   since, as an air-like substance, CO2 is almost invisible, almost
   odorless and quickly diffuses into the surrounding air; and it is only
   through special instrumental apparatus (such as a pneumatic trough) or
   in hermetically sealed locations that it can be(come) sufficiently
   concentrated for it to be recognizable as a unique individual substance.
   This constructive work was carried out between the seventeenth and early
   nineteenth centuries. The older belief in the special status of
   `spirits' was displaced by the concept of gas - but only in
   laboratories. In public communication, `gases' continue to be
   emotionally charged substances that are in no way normal. Further
   investigation of the history of CO2 shows that the substance has been
   increasingly politicized and moralized since around the 1980s in the
   context of the climate change debate. Chemical CO2 is being reconstrued
   as a `pollutant' that threatens the earth and future generations.},

Title = {Building blocks in hierarchical clustering scenarios and their

Abstract = {We carried out a comprehensive analysis of the chemical properties of
   the interstellar medium (ISM) and the stellar population (SP) of current
   normal galaxies and their progenitors in a hierarchical clustering
   scenario. We compared the results with observations of damped
   Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) under the hypothesis that, at least, part of
   the observed DLAs could originate in the building blocks of present-day
   normal galaxies. We used a hydrodynamical cosmological code which
   includes star formation and chemical enrichment. Galaxy-like objects are
   identified at z = 0 and then followed back in time. Random lines of
   sight (LOS) are drawn through these structures in order to mimic damped
   Lyman-alpha systems. We then analysed the chemical properties of the ISM
   and SP along the LOS. We found that the progenitors of current galaxies
   in the field with mean L < 0.5L {*} and virial circular velocity of
   100-250 km s(-1) could be the associated DLA galaxies. For these systems
   we detected a trend for <L /L {*}> to increase with redshift. We found
   moderate metallicity evolution for {[}Zn/H], {[}Fe/H] and {[}Si/H].
   However, when we applied the observational filter suggested by Boisse et
   al. (1998) in order to restrict the sample to the observed limits in
   densities and metallicities, we found mild evolution consistent with
   observational results that include dust corrections. {[}Si/Fe] and
   {[}S/Fe] show weak alpha-enhancement in agreement with observations
   corrected by dust depletion. We found alpha/Fe in the ISM and SP to have
   more homogeneous abundances than {[}Fe/H] and {[}Zn/H]. In our models,
   the global metallicity evolution is driven by the high metallicity and
   high column density simulated DLAs, which have low impact parameters (b
   < 5 kpc), and SPs with more than 10(8) M-.. Our results suggest that
   geometrical effects could be the mechanism responsible for the
   non-detectability of high-metallicity and high-column-density DLAs. We
   found sub-DLAs to map preferentially the outskirts of the simulated DLA
   galaxies. Hence, they can contribute to the study of the metallicity of
   the galactic structure as a function of redshift. An analysis of the
   metallicity content of the ISMs and SPs of the galaxy-like objects as a
   function of redshift shows the formation of a central stellar mass
   concentration with nearly solar metallicity at all redshifts while stars
   in the outer parts of these objects have lower metallicities. The gas
   content becomes enriched progressively with redshift and at all radii.
   The abundance properties of the galaxy-like objects and the simulated
   DLAs are the results of the contribution of type Ia and II supernovae
   and gas infall from the dark matter haloes with a timing settled by
   their particular evolution history in a hierarchical clustering
   scenario. Our results suggest that the mild evolution detected in the
   observations could arise from a conspiracy of all of these processes.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the conflict relations between American
   Freemasons and their ideological opponents in the XVIIIth - first half
   of the XIXth c. Freemasonry in this historical period became an
   influential socio-political force, which caused both fair accusations
   against the secret brotherhood and undeserved attacks on the secret
   alliance. There were two waves of the American Anti-Masonic movement: at
   the turn of the XVIIIth and XIXth cc., and in the 1820s - 1840s. The
   first period of Anti-Masonry was largely associated with the events of
   the Great French Revolution, which shook the Western world. The second
   period had an internal American history - the ``Morgan case{''} of 1826.
   It is shown that Freemasons, despite their elitism, were already
   strongly associated with progress and liberal reforms from the very
   beginning. They were among the first to propose projects for the
   unification of the North American colonies into a single union or
   federation (B. Franklin and earlier), took an active part in the
   struggle for independence and the creation of the American state. The
   Anti-Masons acted as a predominantly conservative social and political
   force.},

Title = {The Impact of COVID-19 on Mortality in Italy: Retrospective Analysis of
   Epidemiological Trends},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the available evidence on its severity, COVID-19 has
   often been compared with seasonal flu by some conspirators and even
   scientists. Various public discussions arose about the noncausal
   correlation between COVID-19 and the observed deaths during the pandemic
   period in Italy.
   Objective: This paper aimed to search for endogenous reasons for the
   mortality increase recorded in Italy during 2020 to test this
   controversial hypothesis. Furthermore, we provide a framework for
   epidemiological analyses of time series.
   Methods: We analyzed deaths by age, sex, region, and cause of death in
   Italy from 2011 to 2019. Ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression
   analyses and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) were used
   to predict the best value for 2020. A Grubbs 1-sided test was used to
   assess the significance of the difference between predicted and observed
   2020 deaths/mortality. Finally, a 1-sample t test was used to compare
   the population of regional excess deaths to a null mean. The
   relationship between mortality and predictive variables was assessed
   using OLS multiple regression models. Since there is no uniform opinion
   on multicomparison adjustment and false negatives imply great
   epidemiological risk, the less-conservative Siegel approach and
   more-conservative Holm-Bonferroni approach were employed. By doing so,
   we provided the reader with the means to carry out an independent
   analysis.
   Results: Both ARIMA and OLS linear regression models predicted the
   number of deaths in Italy during 2020 to be between 640,000 and 660,000
   (range of 95\% CIs: 620,000-695,000) against the observed value of above
   750,000. We found strong evidence supporting that the death increase in
   all regions (average excess=12.2\%) was not due to chance (t(21) =7.2;
   adjusted P<.001). Male and female national mortality excesses were
   18.4\% (P<.001; adjusted P=.006) and 14.1\% (P=.005; adjusted P=.12),
   respectively. However, we found limited significance when comparing male
   and female mortality residuals' using the Mann-Whitney U test (P=.27;
   adjusted P=.99). Finally, mortality was strongly and positively
   correlated with latitude (R=0.82; adjusted P<.001). In this regard, the
   significance of the mortality increases during 2020 varied greatly from
   region to region. Lombardy recorded the highest mortality increase (38\%
   for men, adjusted P<.001; 31\% for women, P<.001; adjusted P=.006).
   Conclusions: Our findings support the absence of historical endogenous
   reasons capable of justifying the mortality increase observed in Italy
   during 2020. Together with the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2, these
   results provide decisive evidence on the devastating impact of COVID-19.
   We suggest that this research be leveraged by government, health, and
   information authorities to furnish proof against conspiracy hypotheses
   that minimize COVID-19-related risks. Finally, given the marked
   concordance between ARIMA and OLS regression, we suggest that these
   models be exploited for public health surveillance. Specifically,
   meaningful information can be deduced by comparing predicted and
   observed epidemiological trends.},

Title = {Pakistan Ranks Third Globally With the Most Unvaccinated Children: Is
   the Impact of Parental Perception and Attitude on Immunization an
   Essential Contributing Factor to an Unsuccessful Vaccination Coverage?},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Having the third-highest burden of child mortality and ranking third
   globally for the most under-vaccinated children, Pakistan contains 15\%
   of its population under the age of five, which accounts for 50\% of the
   mortality rate in this country. Every year, almost three million
   children miss out on an entire course of the most readily available
   vaccines, leaving them vulnerable to life-threatening diseases. The
   Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) was launched in 1978 to protect
   children from vaccine-preventable childhood diseases. It is the main
   program through which routine immunization is provided to the public.
   However, since its inception within Pakistan, it has encountered many
   problems, including a lack of parental awareness and education. Low
   literacy rate, socio-economic disparities, cultural and religious
   beliefs have made parents doubtful about vaccinations. This term is
   known as vaccine hesitancy. Belief in conspiracy theories has also led
   to reduced vaccination coverage in Pakistan.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted on 300 parents with children under
   five, chosen from Karachi, Pakistan, through a convenience sampling
   technique. The data was collected via 300 self-administered or
   researcher administered questionnaires. Associations were evaluated
   using the chi-square test with the level of significance taken asp <
   0.05 and Cramer's V to determine the strength of these associations.
   Data analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
   (SPSS) version 20.0.
   Results
   Strong associations were found between parental knowledge of
   immunization, vaccines, and willingness to get their children immunized.
   Associations were greater and significant in parents with a higher level
   of education compared to lower. However, lack of knowledge about certain
   essential vaccines like Pentavalent, Pneumococcal, and IPV was an
   important aspect to consider. Also, it was noted that their inability to
   access these free vaccines was due to their own firm beliefs. It was
   also about the lack of awareness and facilities for a better and
   beneficial program. 22.3\% of parents said that administering multiple
   vaccines at a time would be harmful to their child, and 21.7\% believed
   it would cause the disease it's supposed to prevent. However, the
   majority of the parents said they would strongly recommend others to get
   vaccinated. In this study, religions included and investigated mostly
   encouraged vaccination to their relatives (p value= 0.079). Occupation
   and Monthly income had little to no effect on the immunization regime of
   young children.
   Conclusion
   An impact of higher levels of education on the perceptions and attitudes
   of parents regarding the immunization of children was noted.
   Consequently, as religion, gender, occupation, and monthly income do not
   affect parents' perceptions regarding immunizations, the problem lies
   within their knowledge and understanding of basic medical science and
   easily communicable diseases. Oblivious to the consequences of
   contracting a lethal disease, it has developed a laid-back attitude
   amongst parents. Hence, awareness and education of parents regarding
   vaccine-preventable diseases by the healthcare system and the governing
   bodies can lead to a higher successful immunization rate.},

Title = {PROBLEMS OF A HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE PHENOMENON OF POSSESSION
   IN THE PUBLIC LIFE OF LATE MEDIEVAL WESTERN EUROPE IN WORKS OF A. HUXLEY
   AND M. CERTEAU},
Journal = {TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL},

Pages = {94-100},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The article discusses the problem of a historical fact interpretation in
   The Devils of Loudun by Aldus Huxley and The Possession at Loudun by
   Michel d. Certeau. The reasons for distinctions in the authors'
   approaches to the process of Loudun of 1632-1640, to the phenomenon of
   possession and its value in the social life of early modern Europe are
   studied. A short description of the phenomenon of possession during the
   ``witch-hunt{''} period is made. A judicial incident in Loudun in
   1632-1640 is studied. The authors' views on the events in Loudun are
   given: A. Huxley's theory of conspiracy and M.Certeau's ``game{''}
   interdisciplinary approaches. A number of key terms are allocated due to
   which distinctions in the authors' concepts become more evident:
   ``church{''}, ``exorcism{''}, ``possession{''}. The author definitions
   of these concepts are offered. On the basis of the given distinctions in
   the views, the author of the article identifies a complex of reasons for
   the refraction of a historical fact and for the formation of a new view
   on events. The first reason is the personality of the author of the
   work. The analysis of how the author's personality influences its
   research is made. A short curriculum vitae of A. Huxley's personality
   and its reflection in his The Devils of Loudun is given, as well as a
   short curriculum vitae of M. Certeau's personality and its reflection in
   The Possession at Loudun. The second reason is the time the work was
   written in. A short description of the time The Devils of Loudun (1950s)
   was written, and its influence on the text are given. The topical
   character of the book and its connection with McCarthyism in the USA and
   with struggle against cosmopolitism in the USSR are stressed. A short
   description of the time The Possession at Loudun (1970s) was written,
   and its influence on the text are given. The connection of the work with
   the process of church renovation. The third reason is the concept
   (philosophical, historical) the author followed when writing the work.
   The theory of ``synthesis{''} of humanitarian and scientific knowledge
   was A. Huxley's philosophical system. The ``pontific{''} has its role in
   the overcoming of the separation of the worldview of a person. Problems
   of good and harm in a human nature, the problem of a human nature and
   its transformation is discussed, as well as issues of Bovarism, the soul
   and body opposition, the concept of an internal demon and
   ``possession{''}. A. Huxley's philosophical system and research
   methodology were reflected in his work. M. Certeau's work shows his
   theory of ``The Other{''} and his historical concept, states the problem
   of interpretation of a source, historiography and heterology as the
   basic terms of his concept, identifies polyphony as his main method of
   research. Generalising conclusions are presented in the article.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is an impartial in-depth analysis of the
   relations between freemasons and the Russian Orthodox Church from the
   late 18 to the early 20 century. The research methodology is based on
   the principles of historicism, comprehensiveness and
   interdisciplinarity. The author uses a wide range of general scientific
   (analysis and synthesis, generalization) and specially-historical
   (critical analysis of sources, retrospective, historical-genetic,
   problem-chronological) methods. The scientific novelty. The paper is the
   first attempt to study the relations of Masonry and the Russian Orthodox
   Church in the late 18- early 20 centuries. Only some of the aspects of
   this issue have been reflected in the academic literature. The authors
   introduces archival documents and fundamental works. Conclusions. The
   authors concludes that there were difficult relationships between
   Catholic Church and the Masons. The conflict arose, however, not on the
   basis of Masonic atheism, because Freemasonry considered religion as an
   important element of the ideological influence on the peoples, while not
   giving preference to any doctrine, arguing that all religions are equal,
   equally transient and imperfect. However, despite the serious
   differences in the ideologies, in the late 18 early 19 centuries the
   Catholic Church and Polish Freemasonry went for a rapprochement for
   political reasons - to fight for the independence of the Commonwealth.
   The conflict between the Masons and the Orthodox clergy did not reach
   such a degree of acuteness that it had in Western European countries
   between the Catholic Church and the Masonic organization. To a large
   extent, this was the result of a more tolerant attitude of Orthodoxy to
   dissidence and the complete administrative dependence of this
   denomination on the state. Even during the reign of Catherine 11, Paul 1
   and especially Alexander 1, high-ranking officials belonged to the
   Masonic organization. The indulgent attitude of the tsarist government
   to ``Royal Art{''} ceased when it appeared that this organization was
   involved in political conspiracies against autocracy and national
   liberation movements. But, despite the strict measures taken by the
   imperial authorities against the Masonic organization, the lodges
   continued to exist, but they functioned more secretly. Freemasonry in
   the 18-19 centuries did not play a leading role in the public-political
   life of the Russian Empire, including the Right Bank Ukraine but it
   significantly influenced it. ``Royal Art{''} apparently prepared society
   for the acceptance of constitutional and republican ideas, the abolition
   of serfdom and significantly affected the ideological growth of future
   generations of both the Russian and Ukrainian intelligentsia. In the
   early 20 century freemasons in Ukraine were much more active in
   political respect than in Russia. It is no coincidence that the
   Ukrainian freemasons put forward the idea to leave the former mystical
   nonsense and fully concentrate their efforts on the political struggle.
   Although political Freemasonry destroyed autocracy, it could not
   overcome its fractional disunity and eventually yielded to more
   organized and politically far-sighted Bolsheviks.},

Title = {Motives and Images of Sacred Practices of the Peoples of Siberia as a
   Factor of Poetics in the Works of Russian Literature},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to reveal the sustained attention of Russian
   writers of different epochs to sacred practices of the peoples of
   Siberia and to discover the role of sacred practices as a factor of
   poetics in the works of Russian literature. Chapter VI of Volume IX of
   The History of the Russian State (1821) by N.M. Karamzin, the tragedy
   Yermak (1832) by A.S. Khomyakov, the short story ``The Other Side{''}
   (1917) by V.Ya. Shishkov and the novel Tobol. Many Are Called (2016) by
   A.V. Ivanov were analyzed. The comparative typological method of
   analysis was applied to select works written in different periods that
   include sacred practices as a significant element of the creative
   interpretation of events. The method of structural analysis helped
   identify the levels of the literary structure of the works under study
   that can be considered most functional for sacred practices. While for
   Karamzin as a historiographer, this is the level of ascertaining of
   symbolic things and signs of fate that accompany events, writers employ
   sacred practices as an element of poetics at the level of images,
   motifs, details or plots of their works. By means of sacred practices,
   writers uncover the specific features of a human perception of the
   world, the deep motivation of human actions, moral and spiritual
   priorities. In the tragedy Yermak, Khomyakov used the motive of a
   shamanistic prediction of Yermak's fate, his death in the ``grey-haired
   Irtysh{''} river. However, Khomyakov made the functioning of this motive
   more complex via a tragic collision of a conspiracy that Yermak's
   closest companions organized with a shaman against him. Yermak perishes
   as a real hero while Khomyakov's shaman totally discredits himself and
   undergoes a spiritual catastrophe. In Shishkov's story ``The Other
   Side{''}, sacred practices are represented neither by a real shaman
   character, nor by cult things or religious ceremonies, but, instead, by
   the characters' passionate desire to resolve contradictions of life with
   the help of the supreme forces. The plot of the taiga love triangle ends
   with the death of the child a shaman has to bring back to life. But the
   shaman and the shamanistic practice become a symbol of the
   unattainability of the characters' hopes in the story. In Ivanov's novel
   Tobol. Many Are Called, sacred practices are an element of the plot that
   predetermines the characters' fate. The sacrificial rite, immolation and
   spells that the female character performs lead to an opposite result.
   Here, it is the shaman's that becomes a pledge for further life and a
   different, ``new{''}, fate. The article provides evidence that, in
   different periods of time, Russian writers address the sacred practices
   of Siberian peoples. Woven into the texts in the form of motifs, images
   or details, these practices help writers disclose the depths of their
   characters' consciousness and souls, their innermost hopes that they
   will be heard beyond the borders of the ordinary, visible life.},

Title = {Natural Language Processing Reveals Vulnerable Mental Health Support
   Groups and Heightened Health Anxiety on Reddit During COVID-19:
   Observational Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},

Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting mental health, but it is
   not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were
   differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to leverage natural language
   processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in 15 of the
   world's largest mental health support groups (eg, r/schizophrenia,
   r/Suicide Watch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with
   11 non-mental health groups (eg, r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during
   the initial stage of the pandemic.
   Methods: We created and released the Reddit Mental Health Dataset
   including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using
   regression, we analyzed trends from 90 text-derived features such as
   sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and semantic categories. Using
   supervised machine learning, we classified posts into their respective
   support groups and interpreted important features to understand how
   different problems manifest in language. We applied unsupervised methods
   such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns
   throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic.
   Results: We found that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts
   about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately 2 months before other
   support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many
   features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific
   groups including the categories ``economic stress,{''} ``isolation,{''}
   and ``home,{''} while others such as ``motion{''} significantly
   decreased. We found that support groups related to
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety
   showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all
   mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across
   Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning
   analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a
   diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of
   history; we discovered that the more users posted about COVID-19, the
   more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support
   groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (rho=-0.96, p<.001). Using unsupervised
   clustering, we found the suicidality and loneliness clusters more than
   doubled in the number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the
   support groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic
   stress disorder became significantly associated with the suicidality
   cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm and entertainment
   emerged.
   Conclusions: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a
   baseline of prepandemic posts, we uncovered patterns of how specific
   mental health problems manifest in language, identified at-risk users,
   and revealed the distribution of concerns across Reddit, which could
   help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then
   demonstrated that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health
   complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable groups
   and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during
   the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections
   and protests.},

Title = {Jurisdiction under and Exclusivity of Private International Air Law
   Agreements on Air Carrier Liability: The Case of <i>Airbus</i> versus
   <i>Armavia Airlines</i> (2013)},
Booktitle = {FROM LOWLANDS TO HIGH SKIES - A MULTILEVEL JURISDICTIONAL APPROACH
   TOWARDS AIR LAW: ESSAYS IN HONOUR OF JOHN BALFOUR},
Year = {2013},
Pages = {261-273},
Abstract = {John and I met at the so called Post Academic Seminars which were
   organised in the very first years of the existence of the International
   Institute of Air and Space Law of Leiden University with which John
   established close ties. John was considered as an expert the moment he
   entered the area of air law, as he quickly understood how national
   interests, European policy objectives and international relationships
   had to be combined in a regime governing civil aviation. To under-stand
   it swiftly and clearly was a challenge.
   John teaches us, and inspires us. He knew about competition law which
   was the theme of those seminars in the days when the then European Court
   of Justice, henceforth also referred to as ECJ, made its landmark
   rulings on the application of competition law to the operation of air
   services, as considered by Peter Haanappel in his contribution to this
   book. Flag carriers of the then European Economic Community (EEC) Member
   States were not necessarily happy with that development as they were
   afraid of being supervised by the then EEC Commission, delivering them
   to the battle field of market forces, rather than being attended by
   their Civil Aviation Authorities who regarded them as a national asset
   which should be protected from market forces in cosy bilateral air
   services agreements.
   However, the European train could not be stopped. It radically changed
   the regulatory and policy scene, which gave rise to myriad questions,
   many of which have been commented upon by John. He has made, and indeed
   continues to make a healthy and transparent contribution to the complex
   interaction between European law and air law.
   In the late 1980s, the United Kingdom (UK) and the Dutch Ministers of
   Transport were forerunners promoting liberalisation. They pushed the
   liberalisation packages through the Council of Transport Ministers,
   while being confronted with vehement opposition from the French and the
   Italians who, in the words of John, felt that competition was an
   Anglo-Saxon conspiracy!
   The Anglo-Dutch liaison was bolstered in the London-Leiden connection
   which was underpinned by John's interest for academic life. More than
   once has he enriched PhD Commissions at Leiden University, where he
   continues to teach. The maintenance of that enticing liaison will he
   secured by him and his successors who are ready to expand this precious
   link in which the practical application of air law is united with an
   academic flair or perhaps even context.
   In the personal Held, his loyalty should be mentioned: loyalty towards
   the rule of law, and loyalty towards his colleagues many of whom became
   friends. All of us are also charmed by his honesty and modesty at which
   point it is time to start exploring reflections on a subject which
   indeed links John and me, and London and Leiden, that is, a brief
   discussion of the recent court case before the Court of Appeal in
   Toulouse, France, in which I sided with Clyde to oppose the claim made
   by Airbus.},

Title = {Study on the Vaccination of the Population of Romania against Monkeypox
   in Terms of Medical Security},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although it has been shown in numerous studies that immunization of the
   population by vaccination is the most effective way to protect against
   smallpox or other polioviruses, the anti-vaccination public rhetoric
   recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to influence the
   populations acceptance of vaccination against newly emerging viruses.
   This fact influenced our decision to study the vaccination of the
   Romanian population against the virus that causes monkeypox, aiming to
   identify the degree of compliance regarding the decision related to
   vaccination acceptance/non-acceptance/hesitation, based on the survey of
   a representative sample of respondents. The study is based on an online
   questionnaire completed between 1 July and 31 July 2022 by 820
   individuals, aged 18 years or above, with a permanent residency in
   Romania. The study was undertaken in order to observe the attitudes of
   the respondents regarding the acceptance, refusal, or hesitation of
   vaccination against monkeypox. The sociological data resulting from the
   application of the questionnaire on 820 people highlighted that 97.16\%
   were vaccinated with the vaccines of the national mandatory scheme and
   53.32\% were vaccinated with the optional vaccines (rotavirus vaccine,
   anti-hepatitis A, meningococcal vaccine, etc.). Although 47.13\% of
   respondents considered monkeypox to be a real problem facing humanity
   today, only 26.37\% of those surveyed expressed their fear of becoming
   infected, and 29.30\% were willing to immunize themselves against the
   virus by vaccination. Only 19.59\% of respondents believed that the
   monkeypox disease will generate a new global pandemic, while 31.86\%
   considered pandemics to be a human security issue, and 30.28\% expressed
   their desire to accept a reduction in some rights and freedoms, in the
   short term, for the adoption of institutional measures to combat a
   possible pandemic caused by monkeypox. The study clearly highlights the
   fact that monkeypox is perceived as a threat to the health of the
   population, with relatively low acceptance of conspiracy theories
   regarding its origins/manifestation/consequences among respondents
   (between 21.7\% and 28.9\%). The vaccination of the population against
   monkeypox is strongly influenced by the validity of the results obtained
   over time, in the vaccination campaigns against the smallpox virus
   (vaccine found in the mandatory vaccination scheme in Romania until
   1979). We believe that the negative public rhetoric regarding the
   COVID-19 vaccination is likely to negatively influence monkeypox
   vaccination. Although specialized studies and practical results showed
   that the immunization of the population through vaccination represents
   an important vector in the prevention/management of pandemic-type
   issues, we believe that a national pro-vaccination campaign, based on
   scientific evidence, can lead the population to accept vaccination when
   the epidemiological context requires it. We also believe that a culture
   of health security needs to be developed among citizens to raise
   awareness of the role of vaccines as an important vector in the field of
   population health.},

Title = {Interdisciplinary Approach to Identify and Characterize COVID-19
   Misinformation on Twitter: Mixed Methods Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {Background: Studying COVID-19 misinformation on Twitter presents
   methodological challenges. A computational approach can analyze large
   data sets, but it is limited when interpreting context. A qualitative
   approach allows for a deeper analysis of content, but it is
   labor-intensive and feasible only for smaller data sets. Objective: We
   aimed to identify and characterize tweets containing COVID-19
   misinformation.Methods: Tweets geolocated to the Philippines (January 1
   to March 21, 2020) containing the words coronavirus, covid, and ncov
   were mined using the GetOldTweets3 Python library. This primary corpus
   (N=12,631) was subjected to biterm topic modeling. Key informant
   interviews were conducted to elicit examples of COVID-19 misinformation
   and determine keywords. Using NVivo (QSR International) and a
   combination of word frequency and text search using key informant
   interview keywords, subcorpus A (n=5881) was constituted and manually
   coded to identify misinformation. Constant comparative, iterative, and
   consensual analyses were used to further characterize these tweets.
   Tweets containing key informant interview keywords were extracted from
   the primary corpus and processed to constitute subcorpus B (n=4634), of
   which 506 tweets were manually labeled as misinformation. This training
   set was subjected to natural language processing to identify tweets with
   misinformation in the primary corpus. These tweets were further manually
   coded to confirm labeling.Results: Biterm topic modeling of the primary
   corpus revealed the following topics: uncertainty, lawmaker's response,
   safety measures, testing, loved ones, health standards, panic buying,
   tragedies other than COVID-19, economy, COVID-19 statistics,
   precautions, health measures, international issues, adherence to
   guidelines, and frontliners. These were categorized into 4 major topics:
   nature of COVID-19, contexts and consequences, people and agents of
   COVID-19, and COVID-19 prevention and management. Manual coding of
   subcorpus A identified 398 tweets with misinformation in the following
   formats: misleading content (n=179), satire and/or parody (n=77), false
   connection (n=53), conspiracy (n=47), and false context (n=42). The
   discursive strategies identified were humor (n=109), fear mongering
   (n=67), anger and disgust (n=59), political commentary (n=59),
   performing credibility (n=45), overpositivity (n=32), and marketing
   (n=27). Natural language processing identified 165 tweets with
   misinformation. However, a manual review showed that 69.7\% (115/165) of
   tweets did not contain misinformation.Conclusions: An interdisciplinary
   approach was used to identify tweets with COVID-19 misinformation.
   Natural language processing mislabeled tweets, likely due to tweets
   written in Filipino or a combination of the Filipino and English
   languages. Identifying the formats and discursive strategies of tweets
   with misinformation required iterative, manual, and emergent coding by
   human coders with experiential and cultural knowledge of Twitter. An
   interdisciplinary team composed of experts in health, health
   informatics, social science, and computer science combined computational
   and qualitative methods to gain a better understanding of COVID-19
   misinformation on Twitter.(JMIR Form Res 2023;7:e41134) doi:

Abstract = {This paper argues that Brown's sleepwalkers in Edgar Huntly offer us an
   early figuration for the problems inherent in the phenomenon we now
   refer to as ``populism.{''} Both populism and sleepwalking function
   through paradoxical and incongruent forms of expression that appear
   incoherent. The most prominent explanations that account for this
   paradoxical form of expression rely on an analysis of the breakdown of
   discourse. However, this paper argues that the incongruous form of
   expression is rooted in the reconfiguration of the social arrangements
   that enable Clithero and Edgar to advance socially but also places them
   in proximity to social crises. The contradictions of this position of
   social mobility are the source of the contradictions of the expression
   of sleepwalking. In depicting a world that makes social identity
   precarious, Brown offers us an explanation for how such paradoxical
   modes of expression are rooted in unstable resolutions of
   post-revolutionary society.},

Title = {Education, Politics and the Secret Service: Adam Bromke's Trips to
   Poland},
Journal = {PAMIEC I SPRAWIEDLIWOSC},

Volume = {2},
Number = {16},
Pages = {339-352},
Abstract = {Adam Bromke, known Canadian political scientist of Polish origin, was
   born in 1928, in Warsaw. During World War II he belonged to the Home
   Army and actively fought in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. He left Poland
   in 1945. He was an activist of the National Party in exile. Between
   1955-1956 he conducted the National Committee for a Free Europe's
   ``balloon campaign{''} in Poland. In the following years Adam Bromke
   worked at many Canadian universities. In his researches he was
   concentrated on the situation in Communist countries in Central and
   Eastern Europe. In 1961, after 16-year absence, he came to visit Poland
   with the intention of collecting material for a new book and
   establishing contacts with Polish scholars. He quickly became an object
   of interest to/of the PRL's intelligence service. He refused to pass on
   any information about other people (especially those of Radio Free
   Europe) to the intelligence service. However, he was willing to
   establish political contacts with Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the MSZ,
   Ministerstwo Spraw Zagranicznych). The intelligence, carrying out
   operational activity towards Bromke, used his friend from the
   conspiracy-Wojciech Sokolewicz, an employee of the Institute of Law
   Studies of Polish Academy of Science (the INP PAN, Instytut Nauk
   Prawnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk). Simultaneously, Adam Bromke treated
   him as a mediator enabling conducting political talks with the PRL's
   authorities-initially with the MSZ, then with the MSW (Ministerstwo
   Spraw Wewnetrznych, Ministry of Internal Affairs). Bromke wanted to be
   regarded as a political partner, an expert, not an ordinary informant.
   During the following visits to Poland (in 1964, 1968 and 1969) he was
   ready to come into confidential contacts with the MSW's leaderships (he
   did not manage to meet with Minister Mieczyslaw Moczar). What was his
   aim? Was he only a political analyst? As a well-known and highly
   regarded expert in the West, he probably wanted to have an access to the
   high-ranking PRL's officials. Did he consider it probable that once the
   importance of Poland's `` Partisans{''} increased he would exert an
   ``backstage{''} influence on their activity? Whenever being under the
   PRL's intelligence service's pressure, Bromke consequently refused to
   get involved himself in secret collaboration. He came to Poland several
   times, in the 1970s and 1980s. He also used to meet with the
   representatives of the PRL's authorities. During that period, he was no
   longer under the Secret Service's surveillance. What is more, he
   consciously played an opinion-forming role. His books and articles
   published in prestigious journals were watering down Western
   intellectual elites' opinion on Communist rule in Poland and in
   Central-Eastern Europe. He was widely criticized by ``Paryska
   Kultura{''} and Radio Free Europe for his openly presented view as well
   as for his activity in general.
   In 1988, Bromke settled permanently in Poland where he became a
   professor at the newly established Institute of Political Studies,
   Polish Academy of Science. He died in Warsaw, in 2008.},

Title = {``FAMILY, FAITH AND FREEDOM{''} FOR WHOM? THE REACTIONS OF THE ROMA
   CIVIL SOCIETY TO THE 2020 RE-EMERGENCE OF THE ROMANIAN FAR-RIGHT},
Journal = {CIVIL SZEMLE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {147-164},
Abstract = {The rise of far-right movements has accelerated in the last decade as
   the effects of financial crisis, intersectional social injustice and the
   COVID pandemics which has led to a disillusionment with politics and
   fostered the rise of populist actors and claims. Post-communist Central
   and Eastern Europe has seen radical movements and populist parties gain
   considerable ground by drawing on nativist and ethnic claims to call for
   a return to an imagined past, free present and utopian future. In
   Romania, populist parties have been able to capitalize on a sense of
   social injustice, national conservative discourse, while also playing on
   historically negative feelings towards ethnic minorities. These patterns
   have been observed through the rise of AUR (The Alliance for the Union
   of Romanians) party which has established a foothold over the past two
   years.
   The aims of the article are to examine the evolution of AUR and the
   reaction of the Roma community towards it, and to analyse the ways in
   which the representatives of the Roma community are polarized towards
   the discourse of AUR. The findings of the article show that pre-existing
   prejudices, long-lasting injustice and newly build conspiracies can be a
   powerful force that not only targets marginalized communities, but also
   challenges the mainstream representatives of the party. The reaction of
   the Roma community is trifold, partly being absorbed by the populist
   movement, partly reacting against the divisive message expressed by AUR,
   partly approving the violent discourse of AUR. The second part of artide
   consists in the organization and the interpretation of the main results
   of a qualitative inquiry we conducted in October-November 2021. During
   the inquiry, we interviewed online 20 leaders of ``Roma NGOs{''}
   (non-governmental organizations specialized in the defence of the human,
   social, economic, political and/ or cultural rights of the Romanian Roma
   ethnics). The selection of the respondents was based on the principle of
   reasonable balance in terms of gender, age, location and education as
   reported to the average Roma civically and politically active citizens.
   To each participant, we applied a semi-structured interview. For the
   analysis of the responses, we used the inductive thematic analysis
   described by Warren and Karner (2014).
   As a result of this inquiry, we synthesized three main arguments of the
   Roma NGO militants with regard to the AUR's emergence's consequences
   over the future of the Roma communities. Firstly, the Roma civil society
   representatives believe that AUR is a potential threat for the Roma
   communities, given the party's ideological lineage with the interwar
   fascist movements and regimes. Secondly, they believe that, as it is
   deeply Eurosceptic, AUR will affect Romania's European path, with
   negative repercussions on all the majority-minority relations. Thirdly,
   but on a contrary, the Roma NGO militants think that AUR has a
   socio-economic platform oriented towards more redistribution, which
   could be favourable to the disadvantaged and marginalized Roma
   communities.},

   epistemology and the medical freedom movement},
Journal = {EMOTIONS AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic saw the implementation of public health measures
   that caused significant disruption to daily life. Consequently, these
   measures were met with widespread resistance. It was argued that this
   resistance was driven by anti-scientific attitudes, as individuals
   refused to comply with mask mandates and lockdowns, and later resisted
   vaccination efforts. This article asks whether this is an accurate
   characterisation of those challenging efforts to combat the COVID-19
   pandemic. To address this question, this article draws on fieldwork at
   medical freedom rallies. These rallies were explicitly organised to
   challenge policies aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. The
   primary finding is that rather than being a conflict between proand
   anti-scientific forces, the conflict instead largely stemmed from who
   can properly lay claim to the mantle of science. Attendees questioned
   the legitimacy of the science justifying limitations on their personal
   liberty and suggested that extra-scientific concerns such as a desire
   for political control had compromised the objectivity of public health
   experts. This work contributes to ongoing debates concerning
   institutional trust and the role of expertise in democratic governance.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {This article explores the three themes of civic nationalism, imperial
   identities and Punjabi migration by focusing on the life of Sundar
   Singh, a migrant to Canada who came to prominence in the early 1900s,
   through his speeches. Sundar Singh employed the idea of equal status of
   all British subjects in the British Empire to argue for the migration of
   Sikhs to Canada and other British settler societies and their being
   treated with respect and fairness on their arrival in their new homes.
   Although Singh's claim to Britishness was rejected in many sections of
   Canadian society, it was supported by some white Canadians. The article
   suggests that British identity of the Empire's Dominions could, in some
   circumstances, be a force for the inclusion of South Asians. The article
   also illustrates the way in which developments in India impacted upon
   those of the diaspora across the British Empire. This idea is developed
   by demonstrating the importance of the triangular relationship between
   India, the United Kingdom and Canada as highlighted by the issue of
   Punjabi migration within the British Empire.},

Abstract = {Experimental methods are used to examine the existence and detectability
   of collusion in environments that exhibit critical parallels to
   procurement auctions. We find that given the opportunity sellers often
   raise prices considerably. Moreover, noncollusive Nash equilibrium
   predictions are insufficient to dismiss ``suspicious{''} behavior as
   innocuous: in an environment where identical prices are predicted in a
   noncollusive Nash equilibrium, common prices are observed only when
   sellers communicate. In a second environment designed to parallel
   construction procurement contracting, market rotations are observed both
   with and without collusion, but collusion can often be detected from the
   pattern of losing bids.},

   Armenian genocide: development and variations in the official denialism},
Journal = {SOUTHEAST EUROPEAN AND BLACK SEA STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 21},
Abstract = {The main source of animosity in modern Turkish - Armenian relations is
   the debate on the international recognition of the Armenian genocide. To
   provide an evidence-based and thorough perspective on the Turkish
   political stance in this discussion, this article explores all the
   relevant speeches in Turkish parliamentary records. It pays particular
   attention to political parties' stances, the historical evolution of the
   debate, and the significance of the individual profiles of
   parliamentarians who contributed to the discussion. The findings show
   that most political parties in Turkey articulated versions of denial,
   except for a few marginal anti-denial voices. The study concludes that
   while political parties' ideological orientations predominantly shape
   the Turkish debate on the international recognition of the Armenian
   genocide, historical contexts, local memories, and the individual
   backgrounds of parliamentarians seem to inspire minor variations in
   their tones.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the cultural politics of a conjunctural moment where
   the terms of neoliberal hegemony have been destabilized and the far
   right has been reinvigorated. Instead of simply assuming the ``end{''}
   of neoliberalism, I explore the potential ideological and communicative
   affinities between neoliberal political rationality and online media
   practices that exemplify the emboldening of racist, misogynistic, and
   authoritarian discourses. I ground the argument by examining how the
   notion of social justice has been articulated in two distinct contexts:
   in disparaging representations of ``social justice warriors{''} that
   originally circulated in ``alt-right{''} sub-cultures, but which have
   since been increasingly mainstreamed, and in the critique of social
   justice formulated by the neoliberal theorist Friedrich Hayek. After
   clarifying my core argument about neoliberalism and the far right, I end
   by reflecting on how the figure of the social justice warrior has also
   been a site of intra-left antagonisms.},

Title = {`Things really have gone very badly for fortune-tellers in recent years,
   but their number does not appear to decrease at all due to that...' The
   <i>Ideological Grounds of the Forest Brother Movement</i> Resistance
   Manifesto (1947-1949)},
Journal = {TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI},

Pages = {115+},
Abstract = {After the re-occupation of Estonia in 1944, thousands of people went
   into hiding in the woods in fear of repressions carried out by the
   Soviet authorities. Thereafter, the resistance movement, in other words
   the `forest brother movement', gradually took shape. Needless to say,
   one part of the resistance struggle was (counter)propaganda, which
   boosted the morale of Estonians and appealed to the people to join the
   struggle against the occupying authorities. The quantity of
   self-published forest brother literature is large and highly varied, yet
   on the background of it all, one document clearly stands out due to its
   broad scope and the high degree of its generalisation. Hence in this
   case, Ideological Grounds of the Forest Brother Movement, the seminal
   text, so to speak, of the Estonian forest brother movement, is under
   consideration. The initiator of the drafting of this text was Richard
   Saaliste, whom the government in exile of the Republic of Estonia had
   sent to Estonia in 1946 to gather information. Erich Jerlet wrote the
   main part of the text.
   Ideological Grounds of the Forest Brother Movement is a multi-layered
   document. Since it was written in three parts separated by approximately
   one-year intervals (1947-1949), and as it discusses various subject
   areas, it can be interpreted in many ways: as ideological principles, as
   a strategy, as tactical guidelines, as the formulation of the nature of
   the forest brother movement, as a chronicle of the forest brother
   movement, and other such interpretations. Generally speaking, it is a
   manifesto of the resistance movement. It formulated the reasons for the
   emergence of the movement, the nature of the forest brother movement,
   and its more general and longer term objectives.
   About half of the document's full text analyses the international
   situation. Its main thesis is that the outbreak of war between the
   Soviet Union and the democratic countries of the West was imminent. In
   the course of that war, armed resistance against Soviet rule would have
   begun at the same time.
   In addition to boosting morale, the document also contains a number of
   practical suggestions on organising, maintaining liaison, military
   preparation, propaganda, and other topics. There are barely any appeals
   for direct practical action against the Soviet regime in the Ideological
   Grounds. Instead, the document's key words seem to be discipline,
   conspiracy, and the physical and mental equilibrium of forest brothers.
   In other words, this is no armed resistance handbook, but rather
   survival guidelines. There was no shame in being killed by bullets fired
   by state security agents but at the same time, needless death was not an
   honourable outcome either. In order to bring one's longer range
   objectives to fruition, one had to first of all survive.
   In summary, the Ideological Grounds is first and foremost a motivational
   speech, which stressed that `Estonia is not alone and the democratic
   Western countries stand behind us,' at the same time providing forest
   brothers with motivation and practical suggestions for continuing their
   struggle.
   Nowadays it definitely is valuable source material primarily for
   researchers studying the (counter) propaganda and motivation of forest
   brothers.},

   early-type galaxies (ellipticals and lenticulars), we re-examine the
   role of angular momentum in galaxies of all types. We present new
   methods for quantifying the specific angular momentum j, focusing mainly
   on the more challenging case of early-type galaxies, in order to derive
   firm empirical relations between stellar j(star) and mass M-star (thus
   extending earlier work by Fall). We carry out detailed analyses of eight
   galaxies with kinematical data extending as far out as 10 effective
   radii, and find that data at two effective radii are generally
   sufficient to estimate total j(star) reliably. Our results contravene
   suggestions that ellipticals could harbor large reservoirs of hidden
   j(star) in their outer regions owing to angular momentum transport in
   major mergers. We then carry out a comprehensive analysis of extended
   kinematic data from the literature for a sample of similar to 100 nearby
   bright galaxies of all types, placing them on a diagram of j(star)
   versus M-star. The ellipticals and spirals form two parallel
   j(star)-M-star tracks, with log-slopes of similar to 0.6, which for the
   spirals are closely related to the Tully-Fisher relation, but for the
   ellipticals derives from a remarkable conspiracy between masses, sizes,
   and rotation velocities. The ellipticals contain less angular momentum
   on average than spirals of equal mass, with the quantitative disparity
   depending on the adopted K-band stellar mass-to-light ratios of the
   galaxies: it is a factor of similar to 3-4 if mass-to-light ratio
   variations are neglected for simplicity, and similar to 7 if they are
   included. We decompose the spirals into disks and bulges and find that
   these subcomponents follow j(star)-M-star trends similar to the overall
   ones for spirals and ellipticals. The lenticulars have an intermediate
   trend, and we propose that the morphological types of galaxies reflect
   disk and bulge subcomponents that follow separate, fundamental
   j(star)-M-star scaling relations. This provides a physical motivation
   for characterizing galaxies most basically with two parameters: mass and
   bulge-to-disk ratio. Next, in an approach complementary to numerical
   simulations, we construct idealized models of angular momentum content
   in a cosmological context, using estimates of dark matter halo spin and
   mass from theoretical and empirical studies. We find that the width of
   the halo spin distribution cannot account for the differences between
   spiral and elliptical j(star), but that the observations are reproduced
   well if these galaxies simply retained different fractions of their
   initial j complement (similar to 60\% and similar to 10\%,
   respectively). We consider various physical mechanisms for the
   simultaneous evolution of j(star) and M-star (including outflows,
   stripping, collapse bias, and merging), emphasizing that the vector sum
   of all such processes must produce the observed j(star)-M-star
   relations. We suggest that a combination of early collapse and multiple
   mergers (major or minor) may account naturally for the trend for
   ellipticals. More generally, the observed variations in angular momentum
   represent simple but fundamental constraints for any model of galaxy
   formation.},

Abstract = {In a companion paper (Paper 1) we have proposed a new candidate to
   account for the dark matter around spiral galaxies: cold H-2 gas in a
   fractal structure, supported by rotation, and concomitant with the HI
   disc. We have shown that this hypothesis is compatible with dynamical
   and observational constraints about disc galaxies, and explains several
   conspiracies and paradoxes, since the dark matter is then in a form of
   fresh gas able to produce stars. In this paper we attempt to describe
   the physical conditions leading to a fractal state of cold gas in outer
   galaxy discs.
   Gas cloud models taking into account the recently disclosed fractal
   structure of cold gas are set up, showing that large errors in the
   classical gas mass determination based on smooth cloud models can easily
   follow if the gas is in reality fractal. Indeed the range of possible
   column densities is then much larger, including 5 or more decades of
   surface densities, instead of 2 for smooth cloud models. Thus fractal
   clouds must present both optically thin and optically thick clumps in
   any single wavelength observations. The observed fractal dimension of
   the cold ISM suggests that mass underestimates by a factor 10 or more
   are typical. Due to its low temperature (around 3 K), and its condensed
   fractal structure, together with its low metallicity, the outer gas
   would be almost invisible for usual detectors.
   We consider the paradox of the persistence of cold kans unstable gas in
   outer discs, far from important heating sources, yet not forming stars
   or Jupiters. Following Rees (1976), we determine the smallest clump
   distribution that can persist in a collisional and almost isothermal
   fragmenting cold gas. At 3 K these elementary cloudlets are predicted to
   have a radius of about 30 AU, and have a mass of the order of a Jupiter.
   Their average density and column density are 10(9) cm-3 and 10(24) cm-2.
   They are gravitationally bound, and their line of sight thermal width is
   about 0.1 km s-1. Their frequent collisions prevent them from forming
   Jupiters or stars and the near isothermality of the fractal nearly
   suppresses energy dissipation. At higher temperature, especially above
   H-2 dissociation, the collision rate in the fractal decreases, favouring
   star formation.
   It turns out that the smallest density condensations, called
   `'clumpuscules'' offer favourable conditions for containing H-2 in both
   vapour and solid phases. However it is unknown whether enough
   condensations sites such as dust exist in the outer discs to permit the
   freezing of H-2. It is expected that the large sublimation energy
   prevents much H-2 to become solid, but a small amount of H-2 ice grains
   is a crucial factor for a good coupling between gas and the 3 K
   background.
   Many of the general arguments presented here about fractals can be
   applied to other inhomogeneous structures, such as the hot gas in galaxy
   clusters. The clumpuscules presented here might be the form of matter in
   which cooling flows in clusters seem to disappear.},

Abstract = {If misinformation is information without truth, this article recognizes
   deformation as a set of processes through which information loses its
   organization. Deformation grants audiences and intermediaries the agency
   and the burden to refashion bits, pieces, and fragments of information
   into coherent and meaningful formulations. Though not necessarily
   problematic, deformation functions as a pervasive precondition of
   information disorder. After deductively deriving the concept of
   deformation, this article presents a case study involving the public
   communication of physics that describes some of the forces that can
   facilitate deformation, including challenges of organizational
   coordination, economic incentives, and technical affordances. This
   article argues that studies of misinformation should attend better to
   the informational environment while recognizing that the continuity of
   information across time and space should be regarded as an achievement.},

Title = {Association of COVID-19 Misinformation with Face Mask Wearing and Social

Abstract = {Wide-spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic has presented
   challenges for communicating public health recommendations. Should
   campaigns to promote protective behaviors focus on debunking
   misinformation or targeting behavior-specific beliefs? To address this
   question, we examine whether belief in COVID-19 misinformation is
   directly associated with two behaviors (face mask wearing and social
   distancing), and whether behavior-specific beliefs can account for this
   association and better predict behavior, consistent with behavior-change
   theory. We conducted a nationally representative two-wave survey of U.S.
   adults from 5/26/20-6/12/20 (n = 1074) and 7/15/20-7/21//20 (n = 889;
   follow-up response 83\%). Scales were developed and validated for
   COVID-19 related misinformation beliefs, social distancing and face mask
   wearing, and beliefs about the consequences of both behaviors.
   Cross-lagged panel linear regression models assessed relationships among
   the variables. While belief in misinformation was negatively associated
   with both face mask wearing (B = -.27, SE =.06) and social-distancing
   behaviors (B = -.46, SE =.08) measured at the same time, misinformation
   did not predict concurrent or lagged behavior when the behavior-specific
   beliefs were incorporated in the models. Beliefs about behavioral
   outcomes accounted for face mask wearing and social distancing, both
   cross-sectionally (B =.43, SE =.05; B =.63, SE =.09) and lagged over
   time (B =.20, SE = 04; B =.30, SE =.08). In conclusion, belief in
   COVID-19-related misinformation is less relevant to protective
   behaviors, but beliefs about the consequences of these behaviors are
   important predictors. With regard to misinformation, we recommend health
   campaigns aimed at promoting protective behaviors emphasize the benefits
   of these behaviors, rather than debunking unrelated false claims.},

Title = {WEDDING CEREMONIES OF TOMSK TATARS IN THE CONTEXT OF TATAR
   ETHNO-CULTURAL COMPLEX},

Abstract = {Wedding ceremony is a complex set of customs and rituals, where we can
   find not only the social and legal norms of the present, but also
   preserved remnants of earlier stages of development.
   Development of native ethnography occurred in two ways: on the one hand,
   the actual material was accumulated in ethnography of peoples of the
   USSR, often only of a descriptive character and on the other hand, at
   the same time, the theoretical foundation for such research was
   developed.
   In the course of work on identifying the specific features of
   traditional wedding rituals of Tomsk Tartars, we tried to find the
   specific features of this ritual of microgroups, which formed the group
   of the Tomsk Tatars (Eushtins, Chats, Kalmaks). The authors who then
   described the rituals of different groups of Tatars (N.A. Tomilov, R.C.
   Urazmanova, F.T. Valeev) had no information about it. The information is
   sketchy. In our description of a wedding ceremony of microgroups of the
   Tomsk Tatars we employed field data, which was collected by the author
   of the paper in 2009-2012.
   We determined the following specific features of the traditional wedding
   of the Kalmak: plots of land were sometimes offered as the ransom of
   bride. ``To pay{''} the ransom was hard, which was the reason for the
   long gap between the matchmaking and marriage; after wooing young couple
   a year or two; marriage portion was prepared after the matchmaking; the
   wedding was held the day after nikah; the wedding feast took place in
   the House of the bride.
   The Chats are marked by the following characteristics: horse races were
   held during a wedding celebration; when the bride was transported to her
   husband, bride wore a lot of clothes.
   The Eushtins: cradle conspiracy was spread very scarcely; a young couple
   could get acquainted by themselves.
   Thus, it becomes obvious that each microgroup had its own set of
   characteristic features in conducting the wedding ceremony (or a
   combination of sets), but to identify them in full requires further
   research and this has not yet been accomplished while writing this work,
   because these parts are missed in sources. By the way, over the last two
   or three centuries, microgroups fused into a united ``Tomsk{''} group,
   and they established a common set of wedding ceremonies. However, the
   informants still have the memories of a specific character of a ritual.
   It is clear that this question requires further collection of data and
   additional comparative analysis.
   In conclusion, the Tatar culture consists of a variety of local options
   - Siberian (Tyumen, Tobolsk Tatars), Kazan (Kazan, as well as Chepeck,
   Perm). Materials were collected by the previous researchers and, first
   of all, N.A. Tomilov and the contemporary field data shed light on the
   ``Tomsk{''} version of the local culture of the Tatar people, as
   manifested in the wedding ceremonies.
   The traditional wedding ceremony of Siberian Tatars was formed under the
   influence of the Kazan Tatars, so in the ritual area of ``Siberian{''}
   (Tomsk, Tumen-Tobolsk) local varieties there are a lot of common
   features with the wedding ceremony of the Kazan Tatars.},

   the Indian revolutionary Manabendra Nath Roy. It focuses particularly on
   his little explored stay in revolutionary Mexico, where he became a
   founder of the Mexican Communist Party in 1919. Drawing on archival
   sources from various countries and Roy's own writings, the article
   situates Roy's exploits somewhere between a global anti-colonialism,
   transnational solidarity and diasporic nationalism. It explores
   particularly the possibilities and the limits of an image of Asia and
   Latin America as regions united in their oppression by imperialism, and
   warranting shared anti-colonial strategies in the framework of
   international Communism.},

Abstract = {Shock events are often pivotal moments in geopolitics and objects of
   intense disagreement among conflicting parties. This paper examines the
   downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over eastern Ukraine in
   July 2014 and the divergent blame storylines produced on Russian and
   Ukrainian television about the event. It then examines results of a
   question asking why MH17 crashed in a simultaneous survey conducted in
   December 2014 in six oblasts in Southeastern Ukraine, Crimea, and the de
   facto states of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria. An analysis of
   the surveys shows that blame attribution was driven more by television
   viewing habits than by any other factor.},

Title = {THE ``READING ALOUD{''} CULTURAL PRACTICE IN THE RUSSIAN TRADITION:
   GENESIS, ``SCENARIOS{''}, LITERARY REPRESENTATION},
Journal = {TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING},

Abstract = {The nineteenth century was a turning point in the development of
   readership: at that time, a gradual transition from intoned reading to
   ``inner reading{''} was made, but before the contact with the book
   became silent, a special passion for reading aloud appeared among the
   noble people.
   Formulation of the concept ``reading aloud{''} in the 1800s-1840s, its
   genesis, semantic content and the main cultural ``scenarios{''} became
   the subject of this study. The material for the study was the works of
   K.N. Batyushkov, A.S. Pushkin, N.P Ogarev, as well as memoirs of their
   contemporaries.
   In the literary and book-centric nineteenth century, reading aloud
   accompanied people all their life: the biography of the nobles began
   with intoned reading as a didactic device. As a rule, parents helped
   children to learn the alphabet and then encouraged them to read: in this
   regard, evening reading parties became one of the favourite forms of
   family leisure. Most memories of the contemporaries are about the
   didactic ``scenario{''} of reading and family reading.
   Reading in the circle of friends was a declaration of creative freedom
   and liberal views. Literary novelties and texts forbidden by censorship
   were read among the trusted ones. The recitation of texts by heart in a
   narrow circle was a means of liberal conspiracy and testified to the
   courage of civil views. In addition, a person who had the gift of
   expressive reading, was the soul of the company, he easily charmed women
   (reading aloud to the object of one's love is considered to be one of
   the romantic reader practices of the early 19th century).
   The disadvantage of reading was also known to culture: the graphomaniac
   composition, tedious reading aloud caused the ironic reaction of
   contemporaries.
   Following the rebellious youth came maturity, old age, and with them a
   new scenario of reading appeared: servants and children read to
   gentlemen while they were having a rest. So the older generation filled
   home leisure with books and were proud of the success of the
   children-readers.
   Thus, in the culture of the Pushkin era, intoned communication with the
   book was familiar to people of all ages, only its ``scenario{''}
   incarnations and the literary tastes of the readers themselves changed
   with time.
   The fascination with reading aloud at the dawn of the nineteenth century
   is explained by the orientation of artistic literature on colloquial
   speech. Oriented on a secular conversation, the literary text required a
   ``reverse translation{''} - a sound expressive reading aloud.
   Today, the return of the cultural phenomenon of intoned reading is
   explained by the desire to revive Russian classics, there is a reason
   why online initiatives have headlines: ``Karenina. Live Edition{''} or
   ``Chekhov Lives{''}. A. Kirby, speaking of the culture of modernity,
   says: ``The product of pseudomodernist culture cannot and does not exist
   without the physical intervention of the individual in its
   production{''} (Kirby, A. The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond). In
   creating a work everyone is equal, everyone's voice is needed for a
   ``common cause{''}, and this common cause is reading out aloud.},

Title = {How communication makes the difference between a cartel and tacit
   collusion: A machine learning approach},
Journal = {EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {152},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper sheds new light on the role of communication for cartel
   formation. Using machine learning to evaluate free-form chat
   communication among firms in a laboratory experiment, we identify
   typical communication patterns for both explicit cartel formation and
   indirect attempts to collude tacitly. We document that firms are less
   likely to communicate explicitly about price fixing and more likely to
   use indirect messages when sanctioning institutions are present. This
   effect of sanctions on communication reinforces the direct
   cartel-deterring effect of sanctions as collusion is more difficult to
   reach and sustain without an explicit agreement. Indirect messages have
   no, or even a negative, effect on prices.},

Volume = {141},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article discusses the rationale of adeia (immunity) in the
   fifth-century Athenian legal system. It argues that adeia was designed
   to grant a temporary suspension of the effect of a law in exceptional
   circumstances without allowing for any permanent legal change. This
   article explores the origin of adeia and the relevant ideology
   underpinning the legal procedure. It provides a comprehensive
   reconstruction of the legal procedure and analyses the extensive use of
   adeia for collecting information during the investigation of the
   profanation of the Mysteries and the mutilation of the herms in 415 BC.
   This article also discusses the implications of the use of adeia for
   public investigation and emergency powers in Classical Athens.},

Abstract = {Most sociological explanations tacitly assume that contemporary social
   orders are based on the propensities of active, purpose-driven entities.
   These explanations underestimate the stabilizing effects of fatalistic
   patterns which make members accept even those social arrangements that
   they do not appreciate, and prevent discontent from being translated
   into a critique of society. This kind of fatalism cannot only be found
   among the utterly powerless. There also is a fatalism of the privileged
   (which sometimes takes the form of ``positive thinking{''}), as well as
   a kind of fatalism particular to social elites. This elite fatalism also
   demonstrates how fatalism, since it eases the burden of thinking about
   alternatives, has action-enabling effects (which are part of this
   stabilizing mechanism). In order to analyze these order-sustaining
   mechanisms, this paper first reconstructs a self-critique of
   sociological normativism going from Durkheim to Bourdieu and to
   Boltanski to then take up classical pragmatist ideas that help us to
   understand fatalism as a particular type of socially mediated
   reflexivity.},

Abstract = {The well-worn critique of ``belief{''} as inadequate for understanding
   ritual motivation and practice has become a truism in need of
   reevaluation. For groups who foreground the establishment of truth in
   ritual practice, ``belief{''} is a useful analytic term that brings
   together propositions and commitment to the relationships and systems
   articulating those propositions. Spiritualism is a religious movement in
   which mediums attempt to communicate between the spirits of deceased
   people and their loved ones. As Spiritualist mediums see it, their main
   job is to provide ``proof of survival{''}-evidence that they are really
   in touch with the spirit world. In doing so, they ``serve Spirit,{''}
   working on behalf of those in the spirit world. Drawing on Bakhtin's
   treatment of dialogism and architectonics, I urge a rethinking of
   ``belief{''} as a never-completed project worked on intersubjectively.
   This approach to belief not only makes sense for analysis of groups who
   insist on the importance of truth claims but also liberates the term for
   use outside of Christian and self-consciously modern contexts, as
   Bakhtinian dialogism is grounded in a model of the utterance and
   interactivity in general and not in any specific utterance or pattern of
   interaction.},

Abstract = {This paper traces the global travels of Indian revolutionary Manabendra
   Nath Roy (1884-1954), with special attention to the tension between
   nationalism and communism in his transnational political writings and
   networks. In particular, the article examines Roy's sojourn in
   revolutionary Mexico between 1917 and 1920, time during which he
   approached Marxism and signed as one of the founders of the Mexican
   Communist Party. The paper is therefore based on Roy's own writings, as
   well as on German and British diplomatic documents. The example of Roy's
   trajectory is used here to advance a number of more general arguments of
   theoretical nature regarding the advantages and problems of a
   transnational historiography and its relation to biography as a
   historiographical genre.},

   Nevertheless, the connections between religion and immunisation refusal
   can be complex, while there is a deficit of research exploring religion
   and vaccination doubts in Australia. With that in mind, this study
   considers Australian vaccine hesitancy with respect to religion and
   trust by analysing the 2018 Australian Survey of Social Attitudes and
   the Australian dataset of the 2018 Wellcome Global Monitor. Statistical
   analyses reveal no significant correlations between religion and vaccine
   hesitancy, while participants with negative vaccine attitudes identify
   that they do not have religious reasons for being vaccine hesitant.
   Nonetheless, a higher proportion of respondents with negative vaccine
   attitudes self-identify as religious or spiritual and main-tain
   pro-religious views. It was also found that negative vaccine attitudes
   are correlated with unfavourable perceptions of both Jews and Muslims.
   Notably, religious self-identification divides two main groups of
   vaccine hesitant participants, described as Religious Conservatives and
   Nonreligious Progressives. These groups diverge on sexual ethics and
   social concerns, as well as around whether they trust in science as
   opposed to religion, while differing in their perceptions of Jews. What
   unites these vaccine hesitant participants, however, is a mutual lack of
   trust in government and scientists.},

Abstract = {How do geopolitical beliefs affect the attribution of blame for violent
   conflict? It is usually assumed that citizens in post-conflict societies
   come to adopt official nationalist discourses that fixate on the other
   side. Yet scholars of critical geopolitics recognize the importance of
   affect and localized interactions in shaping beliefs about the political
   world. This paper analyzes how geopolitical imagination shapes
   Azerbaijanis' attribution of blame for the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,
   using data from a quasi-experimental study in Azerbaijan. Despite
   official narratives that demonize Armenia, the beliefs of Azeris in the
   study diverge in important ways from the official line. In particular, a
   disproportionate number of subjects ``scaled up{''} culpability for the
   conflict and assigned a significant amount of blame to Russia. Subjects
   were prone to perceive Armenia as a Soviet-Russian proxy and to view
   Armenian behavior as subordinate to Russian interests rather than
   intrinsically derived. I argue that this causal accounting for the
   conflict reflects commonsense beliefs about how power is exercised,
   which were shaped by Azerbaijan's structural position vis-a-vis Russia
   and historical tropes that emphasize subversion, duplicitousness, and
   hidden agendas. The findings focus attention on how geopolitical
   imaginations can shape the ways contemporary events, including conflict,
   are interpreted. They also demonstrate the need to dig beneath the
   official discourse to reveal the sometimes surprising ways it is
   contested or subverted.},

Title = {SECRETS AND LIES: THE PERSECUTION OF MUHAMMAD SALAH (PART II)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PALESTINE STUDIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-53},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Among the handful of high-profile terrorism cases in which the U. S.
   government has failed to win convictions in jury trials, that of
   Muhammad Salah stands out. Like the cases against Sami Al-Arian,
   Abdelhaleem Ashqar, and the Holy Land Foundation, the case against Salah
   was built on the criminalization of political support for the
   Palestinian resistance. But while the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is at
   the core of all four cases, Salah's, unlike the others, was primarily
   about Israel: the case was manufactured in Israel, the evidence on which
   it was based was generated in Israel, and its prosecution depended on
   close U.S.-Israeli cooperation at every turn.
   Salah, a Palestinian-American Chicago resident and former grocer, was
   arrested in Israel in January 1993 while on a mission to distribute
   money to poverty-stricken Palestinians in the occupied territories.
   Accused of being a U.S.-based Hamas terrorist commander, he was
   interrogated by Shin Bet, tried before a military tribunal, and spent
   almost five years in prison in Israel. While the U. S. initially
   supported Salah and rejected Israel's accusations against him, in
   January 1995 he became (while still in prison) the first and (to date)
   only U. S. citizen to be branded a ``specially designated terrorist{''}
   by his government. Upon his return home in November 1997, he was one of
   the main targets of an intensive terrorism funding investigation,
   dropped in 2000 for lack of evidence but reactivated in 2002 in the wake
   of 9/11.
   In this two-part exclusive report, Salah's lawyers recount for the first
   time the details of their client's labyrinthine case. Part I focused on
   the Israeli phase of the story, including the political context of
   Salah's arrest, and the investigations and legal proceedings launched
   against him in the United States when he returned. In essence, part I
   laid the foundation for the trial to come, emphasizing in particular its
   complex legal underpinnings and implications as well as its importance
   as a ``test case.{''} Part II focuses on the post-9/11 period that
   unfolded under the George W. Bush Justice Department, starting with
   Salah's indictment in November 2004, continuing with the two years of
   contentious pretrial preparations and hearings, and ending with the
   trial itself. As in part I, the legal dimensions of the case are
   emphasized, as are the government's maneuvers to advance new standards
   governing the admissibility of coerced confessions and secret evidence
   at trial and to manipulate other established principles of the U.S.
   criminal justice system.
   This article deals solely with Muhammad Salah, but Abdelhaleem Ashqar, a
   former professor of business administration in Virginia, was his
   codefendant at trial. Both were indicted, along with twenty other
   coconspirators, for participation in a fifteen-year ``racketeering
   conspiracy{''} to ``illegally finance terrorist activities{''} in Israel
   and the occupied territories, as well as for several lesser charges. The
   two men had never met before the trial opened in October 2006. Despite
   the common charge, their cases were very different and went forward in
   parallel fashion, with different lawyers, witnesses, arguments, and
   entirely separate pretrial proceedings. When the jury trial ended in
   February 2007, both men were acquitted of all terrorism-related charges.},

Title = {The Turning-point between `Totalitarianism' and `Democracy':
   Hypothetical Outcomes to Events in Czechoslovakia in 1989},
Journal = {PAMIEC I SPRAWIEDLIWOSC},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Number = {18},
Pages = {13-52},
Abstract = {The consideration of hypothetical alternatives to historical development
   in clearly established general conditions are, the author believes, a
   natural part of historical thinking. In this article he looks at the
   `Velvet Revolution', that short period from the collapse of the
   Communist regime to the pushing through of a democracy in Czechoslovakia
   in November and December 1989, which for him becomes the space for such
   hypothetical reflections. In the historical records he seeks the key
   junctures in developments, and tries to outline the directions or paths
   that the political actors and members of the public could have set out
   on, but did not. In each case he starts from the assumption that one
   important factor of the previous events has changed. First of all, he
   asks whether a possibility of fundamental change had begun to emerge
   even before 17 November 1989, and he seeks to answer the question with
   regard to the influence of Gorbachev's perestroika. He calls the Reform
   Communists, who had been expelled from the Party, the legitimate
   potential Czechoslovak actors of perestroika. These Communists were
   based around the Klub pro socialistickou prestavbu Obroda (Renewal, the
   Club for Socialist Restructuring), and sought to continue the ideals of
   the `Prague Spring' of 1968. Like every other potential opposition
   group, however, they were kept down by the `normalization' regime. In
   circumstances in which the Soviet Union, of its own accord, was ceasing
   to intervene directly in the affairs of the other Soviet bloc states
   (which in Czechoslovakia meant the petrification of the `conservative'
   structures of power), the reformists' chances were, the author argues,
   very limited. He then considers the fundamental interpretations, which
   emerged in the 1990s, of the Velvet Revolution as a conspiracy.
   The core of the article is a consideration of the probability, the
   concrete forms, and possible consequences of six possible outcomes of
   developments: (i) after the brutal police action against the
   demonstrators on Narodni trida, Prague, on 17 November 1989, the would
   not have led to the spreading of the false report about the killing of a
   student named Martin Smid which mobilized the Czechoslovak public; (ii)
   the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party would have tended to
   some kind of violent solution to the crisis with the help of the army on
   the `Chinese model'; (iii) in the revolutionary days the existing
   Communist leadership would have joined forces with the former reform
   Communists with the aim of preserving a Socialist regime; (iv) in
   December 1989 the Civic Forum would not have managed to get the Federal
   Assembly to elect Vaclav Havel President of Czechoslovakia, and in the
   following months the president would have been elected by popular vote
   from amongst several candidates, as had been proposed by the Communist
   Party; (v) the Civic Forum and the Public Against Violence as the
   revolutionary representatives would have rejected the compromise
   solution of handing over power at `Round Table' negotiations, and would
   instead have dictated the terms and conditions of the victory, including
   the introduction of a plurality electoral system; (vi) the political
   actors of the `Velvet Revolution' would, in the first month, have
   effectively concentrated on the problem of coming to terms with the
   Communist past, which, in the form of uncompromising anticommunism,
   began from January 1990 onwards to convulse the political scene, and
   remains a sore point to this day.},

Title = {Myths in the Russian Collective Memory: The ``Golden Era{''} of
   Pre-Revolutionary Russia and the ``Disaster of 1917{''}},
Journal = {SCANDO-SLAVICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {64},

Pages = {31-46},
Abstract = {This paper examines shared ideas, values and interpretations of the past
   in the collective memory of the 1917 October Revolution. Employing a
   qualitative approach to examine collective memory from below, two age
   cohorts were interviewed in three Russian cities from a variety of
   social groups in 2014-2015. What was revealed was the existence of a
   strong positive myth about the pre-revolutionary era of 1900-1914, as
   well as positive references to the current Putin era. Both eras were
   positive in that Russia was/is a normal European power, on the rise
   economically and respected by the other powers. In terms of the
   definitive national trauma, an overwhelming majority viewed the 1917
   October Revolution as a break or rupture in Russian history that caused
   appalling destruction. This view of 1917 as catastrophic leads to
   certain key lessons: that revolutionary change is inherently destructive
   and wasteful and that external forces had (and have) a vested interest
   in weakening Russia from without whenever she is at her most vulnerable.
   Overall, at the heart of myths over 1917 we find a central occupation
   with the threat of disintegration and a yearning for stability and
   normality, highlighting how collective memory interacts with political
   values and social identity.},

Abstract = {In games like chess, the node-expansion strategy significantly affects
   the performance of a game-playing program. In this article we propose a
   new game-tree search algorithm that uses the realization probabilities
   of nodes for deciding upon the range of the search. The realization
   probability of a node represents the probability that the moves leading
   to the node will actually be played. Our algorithm expands nodes as long
   as the realization probability of a node is greater than the threshold.
   Therefore, it spends little computational resource on unrealistic moves,
   resulting in a more effective search. We have implemented this algorithm
   in a Shogi-playing program. Experimental results show that the proposed
   algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on a standard test suite
   for computer Shogi. Moreover, its performance gain is equivalent to a
   speed-up of more than two.},

Abstract = {The literature on the history of passports has been generally discussed
   in the context of freedom of movement around the globe during the 19(th)
   century. However, with its administrative regulations and practices, the
   Ottoman Empire offered a different view of passports and mobility
   controls. Through perceiving new threats from the political issues of
   the late 19(th) century and directing its attention mainly at the
   Armenian and Macedonian Questions, one of the critical issues facing the
   Ottoman government during the Hamidian Era (1876-1908) was controlling
   the geographic mobility of the individuals who were perceived as a
   threat based on Ottoman security policies. This paper brings a
   particular case of this history into focus: the administrative control
   of the mobility of Armenians. Despite the fact that extensive research
   has been done on the Armenian Question, so far, little has been written
   on the policies restricting their mobility. This paper aims to explore
   the passport regulations and practices to shed light onto the
   relationship between state formation, Ottoman threat perceptions and the
   marginalisation of the Armenian community. I offer a new look at the
   securitisation of the Armenian Question.},

Abstract = {When we look at the situation of the Soviet Jews from 1941 to 1953, we
   can see the development of a feeling of unity, mainly in the sense of an
   emerging national identity, with only a limited impact on religion.
   Following Martin Buber, we could also say that in the dynamic
   combination of national and religious elements the national factor was
   clearly dominating. Jewish religion and traditional way of life, which
   had already lost their basis at the end of the thirties, had in any case
   failed to become a decisive factor of Jewish identity in the Soviet
   Union, in spite of considerable efforts of the Jewish communities. The
   actual formation of a national identity among the Jews, however, put a
   great strain on the relationship between the Soviet state and the Jews,
   which became obvious from 1947/48.
   In the post-war period it obviously depended to a high degree on local
   councils and institutions to what extent it was possible for the
   communities to hold religious services, to keep the Sabbath, to
   celebrate important religious festivals and to observe religious customs
   in general (this was similar to the way of dealing with the Jewish
   religion which had been characteristic for the twenties and the
   beginning of the thirties). The fact that the regime had more urgent
   problems to solve in the economically and socially desolate situation
   after the war temporarily increased the discretionary powers of local
   authorities in dealing with the religious communities, which were in
   principle still unwelcome. Generally speaking, we can say that until
   about 1947/48 the Soviet regime showed little interest in the religious
   life of the Jews, especially as, according to statistics, it was only a
   peripheral phenomenon. But later, when religious activities were joined
   by national statements and feelings - supposed or real - the regime
   began to observe the activities in the religious communities with
   extreme distrust. This was especially the case after the foundation of
   the state of Israel in May 1948.
   From 1947/48 onward Soviet ideology and politics were clearly
   characterized by anti-Semitism and thus the Jewish believers in the
   Soviet Union came under pressure once again. The Jewish communities were
   indiscriminately defamed as ``hotbeds of Jewish nationalism{''}. Very
   briefly, I would like to point to the events of the years from 1948 to
   Stalin's death in March 1953, which have gained an unfortunate notoriety
   as the ``black years{''} of the Soviet Jews. Expressions of the state's
   anti-Semitism during those years were the dissolution of the Jewish
   Anti-Fascist Committee and the arrest of its members at the end of 1948,
   the so-called campaigns against cosmopolitanism and Zionism, during
   which hundreds of Jews lost their jobs and many were arrested, the
   secret process against the leading members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist
   Committee in the summer of 1952, and above all the so-called conspiracy
   of the Kremlin doctors or ``doctors' plot{''} in early 1953, which
   started an unprecedented defamation of the Jews, instigated by Stalin.
   Although the religious communities were also affected by the extensive
   repressive measures against the Soviet Jews from 1948 to 1953, these
   measures were first of all directed against the Jews as a national
   minority. In the eyes of the regime, the Jewish religion as such did no
   longer pose a ,,threat{''} for the Soviet Union - an assessment which
   was basically correct.},

Abstract = {The first reported court trials for war crimes concerned offenses
   committed during the American Civil War (1861-1865). After World War I,
   the victorious nations of the Entente attempted to put the former German
   Emperor Wilhelm II and other German military leaders responsible for
   particularly drastic crimes. The former ruler took refuge in the
   Netherlands, which refused to extradite him, and the Reich Tribunal in
   Leipzig held a number of trials under heavy pressure from the victorious
   coalition. The majority of them led to acquittals or exceptionally short
   sentences, which resulted in the Leipzig process being labelled a
   travesty of justice; during World War II the allies regarded it as a
   negative experience which they should avoid repeating at all costs.
   During the period 1919-1920 several dozen trials concerning the
   slaughter of Armenians were held in Turkey by Turkish and British
   authorities, but they were equally inadequate for the scale of the
   crimes committed involving the murder of almost a million people. The
   anti-Hitler coalition thus could not draw on any real examples from the
   past when seeking to account for the crimes of the Third Reich and its
   allies, nor were there any international legal regulations or
   institutional solutions that they could look to. The first action taken
   to document the crimes committed in occupied countries were undertaken
   by governments-in-exile in London, primarily that of the Republic of
   Poland. It was pressure from that as well as other governments as well
   as others which led to the formation of the War Crimes Commission in
   October 1943, which developed a new legal concept and category: crimes
   against humanity. It turned out to be key in enforcing liability for
   crimes against civilians; it was invoked during the Nuremberg trials,
   and is also applied in many contemporary criminal proceedings. The first
   joint Allied commitment to prosecuting war crimes was the Moscow
   Declaration of 1 November 1943, but even after its adoption there were
   serious disagreements among the allies as to how this should be done.
   Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, was opposed
   to the creation of an international tribunal, citing the different legal
   systems of the Allies and the fiasco of the Leipzig trials following
   World War I; he was a supporter of summarily executing the leaders of
   the Third Reich and fascist Italy. The legal framework of the post-war
   trials was only developed during the closing months of the war, with
   American politicians and lawyers playing a key role. Their contribution
   was to base the most important post-war trials on three pillars: the
   categories of crimes against humanity, crimes against peace and the
   charge of conspiracy to commit crimes ( a direct transplant from the
   American legal system). The trials held before the International
   Military Tribunal, held in Nuremberg from 20 November to 1 October 1946,
   were an attempt, unprecedented in the history of civilization, by the
   international community to bring to justice the leaders of a defeated
   state to justice for their crimes. In spite of the numerous criticism
   levelled against various aspects of the Nuremberg trials, it ultimately
   became a point of reference and an example for later attempts at placing
   political and military leaders on trial for their crimes.},

Title = {ALLIANCE IN EXILE BETWEEN THE RADICAL CIOMPI AND MAGNATES AGAINST THE
   FLORENTINE GUILD REPUBLIC (1379)},

Series = {Middle Ages Series},

Abstract = {The revolt of the Ciompi, wool workers and artisans of the popolo
   minuto, is best understood as three revolts. First, on 18 June 1378
   Salvestro de' Medici and others from merchant-elite families sparked a
   constitutional struggle that challenged the Guelf Party's political
   dominance.(1) Through the institution of ammonite, or denunciations,
   they were able to expose the Guelf Party's manipulation of government
   elections. This revolt was supported and may indeed have succeeded
   because of artisans and workers rioting in the streets of Florence,
   resulting in the destruction of several magnate palaces. The second
   revolt came a month later, (20-22 July), when workers in the wool
   industry, who had no guild status and therefore no representation in
   government or any rights as citizens, stormed the communal palace of
   Florence and successfully overthrew the government. First, they
   established an emergency government of thirty-two, comprised largely of
   wool workers and artisans, and then a new guild government which added
   three revolutionary guilds to the traditional twenty-one {[}see\#20]. In
   effect, guild representation and citizenship was extended to all workers
   in Florence.
   At the end of August, a group of disgruntled aristocrats and wool
   workers, known as the ``Eight of Santa Maria Novella,{''} plotted to
   push the revolution further and tried to force their proposals through
   the government. They failed, and in reaction the government disbanded
   the third revolutionary guild the Popolo di Dio, composed of the least
   skilled workers and apprentices of the city. Workers of the two other
   revolutionary guilds, however, maintained their newly won status and
   allied with minor and major guildsmen to form a new government. The
   Government of the Minor Guilds {[}Arti Minori] ruled Florence until the
   end of January 1382.
   The document below from the Florentine judicial archives gives insight
   into the creativity of the Florentine popolo minuto, their ideology with
   its emphasis on justice; their networks of communication and leadership
   both in Florence and with exiles in other cities; and their alliance in
   exile with the very forces they first rebelled against in the summer of
   1378. After their defeat in early September the allies of the radical
   Ciompi, or Popolo di Dio, included super-magnates such as Adoardo de'
   Pulci who immediately after Salvestro de Medici's constitutional
   reforms, had plotted a counter-revolution to preserve the privileges of
   Florence's wealthiest and most powerful men.(2) The description of the
   conspiracies and its list of rebels and their parishes calls into
   question two general assumptions about the Ciompi and especially about
   the third revolt of late August 1378: (1) that the old Florentine elites
   led and manipulated the workers fir the elites' own interests; and (2)
   that the radical phase was essentially comprised of Florence's poorest
   workers from San Frediano and other parishes south of the River Arno.
   Instead, we find more or less a city-wide representation of these
   workers and artisans in this document and other judicial records that
   prosecuted the radical rebels of the third revolt. In fact, in the
   document below, more of the rebels beneath the ranks of the magnates
   came from north of the Arno (RI) than from the south (9). Finally, this
   is the only document concerning the Ciompi or before it to list a woman
   among the rebels against the Florentine commune: Lady Nicholosa de'
   Medici, from the parish of San Tommaso, would have hardly been from
   among Florence's poor and exploited.(3)},

Abstract = {Vaccination against COVID-19 is essential against the pandemic. There
   are broad discussions on adopting certificates for vaccination and the
   immunity obtained after infection. Based on a national sample of over
   2000 participants administered in April 2021, the current study examines
   the Chinese public's attitudes to the so-called COVID-19 vaccination
   passport and factors contributing to their viewpoints. Generally, the
   Chinese people had favorable opinions on the passport. Among possible
   contributing factors, income, personal benefit perception, the
   subjective norm of COVID-19 vaccination, and nationalism were
   significantly associated with the public's positive attitude. At the
   same time, general vaccine knowledge and scientific literacy had an
   inconstant effect. Echoing recent studies, these findings reveal a
   collectivism-oriented attitude of the Chinese public towards the
   proposal to certify vaccination publicly. Theoretical and practical
   implications of the results were discussed.},

Abstract = {It is not farfetched to argue that South Africa has a culture of
   censorship rather than a culture of freedom of speech. Too easily
   politicians were/are seduced by the ease of censorship. Too easily the
   public has granted the nationalisation of this right. As apartheid, and
   the opposition against it grew, so too did political censorship. The
   evolution of censorship in South Africa was unabated. Apartheid was
   dependent on control. Furthermore, for apartheid to succeed it demanded
   not only a subordinate populace but a conformed society. Especially
   conformity-in-thought. It was essential that the different societies
   knew their place by not merely accepting it, but indeed also believing
   it. Free thinking could too easily lead to contagious rebelliousness.
   Censorship, in many ways, does not have a logical point of saturation.
   The more censorship, particularly of a political kind, flourishes, the
   more ground it needs to keep on covering. At least this was the case in
   South Africa. The vacuum left by the censors was eagerly filled by
   government propaganda.
   Eventually, having grown increasingly disillusioned with an antagonistic
   world and paranoid about its motivations, the apartheid state rethought
   its international position. Although apartheid, ever since its
   conception, solicited criticism and protest from a world which was
   developing in the exact opposite direction, during the late 1970s the
   South African minority leaders reconsidered the never-ending swell of
   pressures. For them the panoramic pressures and criticisms were no mere
   indication of a world which refused to accept the logical humanity of
   apartheid. It was the culmination of a multidimensional Communist
   conspiracy operating on a global level. It was the so-called Total
   Onslaught. In reaction, the minority government executed an
   all-encompassing counterstrategy of its own, the Total Strategy.
   At the heart of both the Total Onslaught and Total Strategy was a
   so-called struggle for the hearts and minds of the people. Information,
   naturally, formed a cardinal part of the crux. Freedom of speech, as
   such, was placed within the cadre of state security. Accordingly,
   information which was, or had the potential to be degrading or critical
   of the authorities or the political status quo was evaluated as possibly
   being part of the Total Onslaught campaign of psychological warfare.
   Breaking down the people trust in their leaders and their will to fight,
   according to the government, was a classic strategy of the enemy to ease
   their planned takeover To protect South Africans by being duped by this
   phantasmagoric onslaught they had to surrender freedom of speech for
   their own benefit.
   By the 1980s censorship was an extensive and sophisticated aspect of the
   state machinery. Freedom of speech, as defined by the regime, was
   bestowed upon the responsible burgers. The South Africa of the 1980s
   exemplifies in many ways a climax of contradictions. Through, within
   context, epic reforms the government of P W Botha made the apartheid
   state more ``open ``. This openness trickled through to freedom of
   speech. Simultaneously, Pretoria welded a nearly impenetrable bulwark of
   political censorship. Information did not necessarily imply an informed.
   Truth depended on government officials' stamps of authenticity. Reality
   became relative.
   This article examines the question why the Botha government, aspart of
   its multidimensional Total Strategy, deemed censorship necessary.
   Furthermore, it looks at how the evolutionary system of interwoven
   censorship appeared and how it was applied After 1994 a considerable
   number of South Africans, especially many whites, declared that they had
   not known. In conclusion the effect of it on the South African society
   will be examined.},

Title = {DENSITY WAVE KINEMATICS AND GIANT MOLECULAR ASSOCIATION FORMATION IN M51},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {410},
Number = {1, 1},
Pages = {68-80},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {New spectroscopic observations of the ionized gas (Halpha and {[}N II]
   lines) in M51 are combined with existing CO, H I, and Halpha data to
   look for kinematic evidence that the gas is responding to a spiral
   density wave. Possible mechanisms for the formation of the approximately
   3 x 10(7) M. giant molecular associations (GMAs) found in M51 are
   analyzed. Problems with the apparent boundedness of the GMAs are
   discussed, as is their eventual fate.
   We begin by presenting CO and H I rotation curves from the OVRO and VLA
   maps of M51 at 8'' resolution. The curves are strongly influenced by
   tangential streaming with a sense consistent with expectations of
   density wave theory. By comparing the CO rotation curve with an Ha
   rotation curve calculated from the 8'' resolution Fabry-Perot data of
   Tilanus and Allen, we find that the ionized gas appears to be rotating
   faster than the molecular gas. We show that this effect is due to a
   conspiracy between the tangential streaming motions and the known
   CO-Halpha spatial offset. The molecular, atomic, and ionized gas
   components all show the tangential and radial streaming motions along
   the major and minor axis at the arm crossings in the sense predicted by
   nonlinear density wave models, and we conclude that a strong density
   wave is present. The amplitude of the radial velocity shift for the
   western arm at 85'' from the nucleus is unusually large and may be due
   to nonlinearities associated with the 4:1 resonance.
   We address the issue of GMA formation and destruction. We first
   quantitatively assess the plausibility of GMA formation through
   gravitational instability by carrying out an analysis based on the
   Toomre criterion, and find it to be a viable mechanism. Given the many
   uncertainties in this calculation, it is concluded, but only marginally,
   that the arm gas is generally above the threshold for instabilities,
   while the interarm gas is close to the threshold. However, arm gas
   should always be more prone to instabilities than interarm ps. That the
   gas is everywhere not too far from the threshold may be a consequence of
   a self-regulating star formation process. The collapse time is
   sufficiently short so that bound GMAs can form in the arms. GMA
   formation by collisional agglomeration is also found to be plausible,
   but only if the collisions are not disruptive in general. It is likely,
   in fact, that these two processes work together to produce, in the end,
   a cloud with a characteristic mass roughly equal to that of a GMA.
   Between the arms, there is probably insufficient time to build a bound
   GMA through either process. A process of GMA formation by gravitational
   instability in a diffuse molecular medium followed by star formation
   would provide an explanation for the CO-Halpha offset. If they are
   bound, the arm GMAs must be rapidly destroyed as they move out of the
   arms. Star formation is the most likely agent to achieve this
   disruption, although direct evidence for such destructive power by star
   formation in M51 is still lacking. There are suggestions, however, that
   the calibration of molecular surface density from CO brightness may be
   somewhat lower in M51 than in our Galaxy. If so, then the arm GMAs may
   not be bound and could simply be disrupted by orbit divergence as they
   leave the arms. Regardless of the boundedness issue, the self-gravity of
   the gas must be important in determining its substructure along the
   arms.},

Abstract = {This Essay sketches an originalist methodology using ideas from legal
   theory and theoretical linguistics, including the distinctions between
   interpretation and construction and between semantics and pragmatics.
   The Essay aims to dispel a number of misconceptions about the methods
   used by originalists. Among these is the notion that originalists rely
   on dictionary definitions to determine the communicative content of the
   constitutional text. Although dictionaries may play some role, the
   better approach emphasizes primary evidence such as that provided by
   corpus linguistics. Another misconception is that originalists do not
   consider context; to the contrary, the investigation of context plays a
   central role in originalist methodology.
   Part I of this Essay articulates a theoretical framework that draws on
   ideas from contemporary legal theory and linguistics. Part II
   investigates methods for determining the constitutional text's semantic
   content. Part III turns to methods for investigating the role of context
   in disambiguating and enriching what would otherwise be sparse semantic
   meaning. Part IV describes an originalist approach to constitutional
   construction. The Essay concludes with a short reflection on the future
   of originalist methodology.},

Title = {Attitudes toward contraceptive methods among African-American men and

Journal = {WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-36},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose. Men's attitudes toward contraceptives are an understudied area,
   even though many men participate in contraceptive decision making. The
   purpose of this study was to examine attitudes and perceptions regarding
   a selection of contraceptive methods among a national sample of African
   Americans, with a particular focus on gender differences.
   Methods. Data come from a telephone survey of African Americans (aged
   15-44 years) living in the contiguous United States. For the present
   analyses, the sample was restricted to 152 men and 281 women who
   reported having had a sexual partner of the opposite gender at some
   point in their lives. Bivariate analyses compared men and women's
   ratings of birth control pills, male condoms, female condoms, Norplant,
   Depo Provera, female sterilization, and male sterilization along several
   dimensions: bad/good, harmful/beneficial, difficult/easy,
   dangerous/safe, immoral/moral and effectiveness. Multiple logistic
   regressions were performed to determine the association between gender
   and contraceptive attitudes, adjusting for sociodemographic variables.
   Results. Male condoms were given the most favorable ratings along most
   dimensions by both African-American men and women. In general, ratings
   of male condoms, female condoms, and Norplant did not significantly
   differ by gender. African-American men did, however, give female and
   male sterilization, birth control pills, and Depo Provera significantly
   poorer ratings than did African-American women.,
   Conclusion. African-American men had less favorable evaluations of some
   contraceptive methods than did African-American women. Further research
   is needed to examine how such gender differences may play a role in
   contraceptive decisions.},

Title = {Reactions and Receptivity to Framing HIV Prevention Message Concepts
   About Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for Black and Latino Men Who Have Sex
   with Men in Three Urban US Cities},
Journal = {AIDS PATIENT CARE AND STDS},

Abstract = {Men who have sex with men (MSM) of color are disproportionately affected
   by HIV in the United States. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using
   antiretroviral medications is a newer biomedical prevention modality
   with established efficacy for reducing the risk of acquiring HIV. We
   conducted formative qualitative research to explore audience reactions
   and receptivity to message concepts on PrEP as part of the development
   of prevention messages to promote PrEP awareness among black and Latino
   MSM in the United States. In 2013, 48 black and 42 Latino (total study
   sample=90) mixed HIV serostatus MSM from Chicago, Ft. Lauderdale, and
   Kansas City participated in either an individual interview or focus
   group discussion. Men were recruited online and at community-based
   organizations in each city. We elicited feedback on the
   comprehensibility, credibility, and relevance of two draft messages on
   PrEP. The messages included efficacy estimates from iPrEx, a phase III
   clinical trial to ascertain whether the antiretroviral medication
   tenofovir/emtricitabine disoproxil fumarate (commercially known as
   Truvada((R))) could safely and effectively prevent HIV acquisition
   through sex among MSM and transgender women. With participants' consent,
   the interviews and focus groups were recorded and transcribed. The data
   were then summarized and analyzed using a qualitative descriptive
   approach. The majority of men were unfamiliar with PrEP. It was
   suggested that additional information about the medication and clinical
   trials establishing efficacy was needed to enhance the legitimacy and
   relevancy of the messages. Participants sought to form an opinion of
   PrEP that was grounded in their own interpretation of the efficacy data.
   However, confusion about nonadherence among clinical trial subjects and
   individual versus average risk limited comprehension of these messages.
   Thematic overlaps suggest that message believability was connected to
   participants' ability to derive meaning from the PrEP efficacy data.
   Despite being concerned that other MSM would interpret the messages to
   mean that condom use was unnecessary while taking PrEP, participants
   themselves primarily understood PrEP as a supplement rather than a
   replacement for condoms. Based on their experience with taking
   antiretroviral medication, HIV-positive men considered condom use a more
   feasible form of HIV prevention than PrEP. Participants' responses
   suggest that more information about PrEP and the clinical trial would
   support the legitimacy of PrEP and the messages as a whole. These
   details may enhance believability in the concept of PrEP and reinforce
   confidence in the validity of the efficacy result.},

Abstract = {This article explores the connections between oral traditions, belief
   and material culture in the context of gentrification and historic
   preservation policy in African American communities, using Decatur,
   Georgia, as a case study. The Decatur example illustrates how history
   and historic preservation are produced in North American communities of
   color, framed by the communities within the contemporary legend known as
   ``The Plan.{''} The Plan offers people living in gentrifying communities
   a means to make sense of the unexplainable: the loss of familiar people,
   buildings, ways of life, and history to gentrification.},

Title = {No evidence that omission and confirmation biases affect the perception
   and recall of vaccine-related information},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Despite the spectacular success of vaccines in preventing infectious
   diseases, fears about their safety and other anti-vaccination claims are
   widespread. To better understand how such fears and claims persist and
   spread, we must understand how they are perceived and recalled. One
   influence on the perception and recall of vaccination-related
   information might be universal cognitive biases acting against
   vaccination. An omission bias describes the tendency to perceive as
   worse, and recall better, bad outcomes resulting from commissions (e.g.
   vaccine side effects) compared to the same bad outcomes resulting from
   omissions (e.g. symptoms of vaccine preventable diseases). Another
   factor influencing the perception and recall of vaccination-related
   information might be people's attitudes towards vaccines. A confirmation
   bias would mean that pre-existing pro-vaccination attitudes positively
   predict perceptions of severity and recall of symptoms of vaccine
   preventable diseases and negatively predict perceptions of severity and
   recall of vaccine side effects. To test for these hypothesized biases,
   202 female participants aged 18-60 (M = 38.15, SD = 10.37) completed an
   online experiment with a between-subjects experimental design.
   Participants imagined that they had a 1-year old child who suffered from
   either vaccine side effects (Commission Condition) or symptoms of a
   vaccine-preventable disease (Omission Condition). They then rated a list
   of symptoms/side effects for their perceived severity on a 7-point
   Likert scale. Finally, they completed a surprise recall test in which
   they recalled the symptoms/side effects previously rated. An additional
   scale was used to measure their attitudes towards vaccines. Contrary to
   the hypotheses, perceptions of severity and the recall of symptoms/side
   effects were not associated with experimental condition, failing to
   support the omission bias, nor did they interact with attitudes towards
   vaccines, failing to support the confirmation bias. This cast doubt on
   the possibility that the spread of anti-vaccination claims can be
   explained by these particular universal cognitive biases.},

Abstract = {One of sociology's aims is to gather traces left in the social world.
   From this standpoint, the appearance of Internet offers a previously
   unknown space for research. This article explores some of the new
   possibilities provided by this social environment and certain of its
   inherent methodological dificulties. Internet is a deregulated
   information market, which makes it a prime location for the
   dissemination of ``fake news{''}. For this reason, the article proposes
   to examine certain of the traces left behind by a very particular
   population group-conspirationists. Which kinds of behaviour can be
   detected in the arguments they use or in their comments on news? This is
   the question adressed in this article, using an approach based on
   computational social science.},

Abstract = {Observational methods as part of a qualitative approach have been
   specifically employed in the study of drug error and have undeniable
   strengths. This position paper will examine some recent research raising
   a number of ethical, and tangentially, methodological issues concerning
   the qualitative study of drug errors within United Kingdom National
   Health Service hospitals. Reflections on the views and ethical conduct
   of other qualitative researchers are provided to contextualize the
   discussion.
   The impact of a drug error, and any resultant adverse event can be
   significant. The human and financial costs are considerable.
   Establishing an accurate estimation of the frequency of adverse event
   and reporting rates has been difficult; additionally, methodological
   weaknesses in medical error research have sometimes caused further
   difficulties. Unsurprisingly, observational studies and for that matter,
   a whole range of other methods are now being considered in the quest to
   establish both understanding and predictability in relation to medical
   error.
   It is argued here that any participants in medical error research should
   be treated in a way that takes account of the prevailing culture of
   health care and, in the United Kingdom, the current ethos of government
   policy on medical error. This requires gaining informed consent,
   promoting transparency in method, and providing the opportunity for
   participants to learn. Effective error researchers can clearly increase
   the available knowledge in this critical area but ethical considerations
   and their chosen methods should show an appropriate level of respect for
   their participants. Carefully implemented qualitative approaches can
   help realize such respect.},

Abstract = {Games with imperfect information are an interesting and important class
   of games. They include most card games (e.g., bridge and poker) as well
   as many economic and political models. Here we investigate algorithms
   for finding the simplest form of a solution (a pure-strategy equilibrium
   point) to imperfect information games expressed in their extensive (game
   tree) form. We introduce to the artificial intelligence community a
   classic algorithm, due to Wilson, that solves one-player games with
   perfect recall. Wilson's algorithm, which we call IMP-minimax, runs in
   time linear in the size of the game-tree searched. In contrast to
   Wilson's result, Koller and Meggido have shown that finding a
   pure-strategy equilibrium point in one-player games without perfect
   recall is NP-hard. Here, we provide another contrast to Wilson's
   result-we show that in games with perfect recall but more than one
   player, finding a pure-strategy equilibrium point, given that such an
   equilibrium point exists, is NP-hard.
   Our second contribution is to present a pruning technique for Wilson's
   IMP-minimax algorithm to make the latter more tractable. We call this
   new algorithm IMP-alpha-beta. We provide a theoretical framework (model)
   and analyze IMP-alpha-beta in that model. IMP-alpha-beta is of direct
   value for one-player, perfect-recall games. It also has strong potential
   for other imperfect information games, as it is a natural (but as yet
   untested) heuristic in those cases.},

Abstract = {An immunizing strategy is an argument brought forward in support of a
   belief system, though independent from that belief system, which makes
   it more or less invulnerable to rational argumentation and/or empirical
   evidence. By contrast, an epistemic defense mechanism is defined as a
   structural feature of a belief system which has the same effect of
   deflecting arguments and evidence. We discuss the remarkable recurrence
   of certain patterns of immunizing strategies and defense mechanisms in
   pseudoscience and other belief systems. Five different types will be
   distinguished and analyzed, with examples drawn from widely different
   domains. The difference between immunizing strategies and defense
   mechanisms is analyzed, and their epistemological status is discussed.
   Our classification sheds new light on the various ways in which belief
   systems may achieve invulnerability against empirical evidence and
   rational criticism, and we propose our analysis as part of an
   explanation of these belief systems' enduring appeal and tenacity.},

Title = {The very flat radio-millimetre spectrum of Cygnus X-1},

Abstract = {We present almost-simultaneous detections of Cygnus X-1 in the radio and
   mm regimes, obtained during the low/hard X-ray state. The source
   displays a flat spectrum between 2 and 220 GHz, with a spectral index
   \textbackslash{}alpha\textbackslash{} less than or equal to 0.15 (3
   sigma). There is no evidence for either a low- or high-frequency
   cut-off, but in the mid-infrared (similar to 30 mu m) thermal emission
   from the OB-type companion star becomes dominant. The integrated
   luminosity of this flat-spectrum emission in quiescence is greater than
   or equal to 2 x 10(31) erg s(-1) (2 x 10(24) W). Assuming the emission
   originates in a jet for which non-radiative (e.g. adiabatic expansion)
   losses dominate, this is a very conservative lower limit on the power
   required to maintain the jet. A comparison with Cyg X-3 and GRS 1915 +
   105, the other X-ray binaries for which a flat spectrum at shorter than
   cm wavelengths has been observed, shows that the jet in Cyg X-1 is
   significantly less luminous and less variable, and is probably our best
   example to date of a continuous, steady, outflow from an X-ray binary.
   The emissive mechanism responsible for such a flat spectral component
   remains uncertain. Specifically, we note that the radio-mm spectra
   observed from these X-ray binaries are much flatter than those of the
   `flat-spectrum' AGN, and that existing models of synchrotron emission
   from partially self-absorbed radio cores, which predict a high-frequency
   cut-off in the mm regime, are not directly applicable.},

Abstract = {I examine the political significance of pseudoscience in contemporary
   Russia. Pseudoscience consists of theories and beliefs that pretend to
   be scientific but are not supported by evidence gathered and analyzed by
   appropriate methods. I argue that there is a mutually constitutive
   relationship between state authorities and some members of the
   pseudoscientific community in Russia. The former use pseudoscience in
   support of their ideological needs and propaganda efforts, while the
   latter utilize anti-Western rhetoric to increase their popularity and
   achieve official recognition. To support this claim, I describe key
   examples of mobilized pseudoscience and analyze their impact on the
   Russian narrative regarding the development of biological weapons near
   Russia's borders.},

Abstract = {Throughout the twentieth century, scholars of the American slave revolts
   were concerned primarily with what the revolts revealed about the
   character of slavery and those who resisted it. Recently, in a shift in
   perspective that has not been fully appreciated, several historians have
   used the methods of micro-history to focus attention instead on the
   process by which stories of the revolts were composed. The emphasis of
   this new approach on silences in the historical record accounts for its
   immense interest to the historical profession, as well as for its
   profound limitation as a contribution to our understanding of American
   slavery.},

Title = {A mixed methods study exploring requests for unproven COVID therapies
   such as ivermectin and healthcare distrust in the rural South},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE MEDICINE REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to contentious discourse regarding
   unproven COVID-19 therapies (UCTs),(e.g. ivermectin). Despite
   recommendations against it, ivermectin remains, in some areas, highly
   demanded. The goal of this study is to understand patient and provider
   perspectives about UCTs (e.g., ivermectin) and how responses to requests
   for UCTs impact healthcare distrust. This mixed methods observational
   study was conducted in a rural healthcare system in the Southern United
   States. Adults (n = 26) with a history of COVID-19 or clinicians (n = 8)
   from the same system were interviewed using questionnaires assessing
   healthcare distrust and qualitatively interviewed exploring perceptions
   about UCTs. Patient themes were: 1) Importance of anecdotal stories for
   decision-making; 2) Use of haphazard approaches to `research'; 3) Strong
   distrust of government and healthcare organizations; 4) Inherent trust
   in local healthcare; 5) Decision-making as weighing pros/cons; and 6)
   Feeling a right to try medications. High survey medians indicated high
   distrust with differences of 8.5 points for those who requested/used
   ivermectin versus those who did not (p = 0.027). Clinician themes were:
   1) Frustration when patients trust social media over clinicians; 2)
   Acceptance of community beliefs about UCTs; 3) Distrust originating
   outside of the healthcare system; 4) Feeling torn about prescribing UCTs
   to build trust; and 5) Variable educational strategies. When clinicians
   are perceived as aligned with government, this may void patients' trust
   of clinicians. Clinicians should leverage trust in local healthcare and
   distance themselves from distrusted information sources. Ethical
   questions arise regarding appropriateness of acquiescing to patient
   requests for ivermectin for building trust.},

Abstract = {The main thrust of this paper is to present to an important adjacent
   scholarly community of literary scholars how humor can be treated by the
   current strand of contemporary linguistics, or more specifically by
   linguistic semantics. In the process, we will show how a major theory of
   humor, the Semantic Script-based Theory of Humor (Raskin 1979a, 1985;
   Attardo 1994) first evolved into the General Theory of Verbal Humor
   (Attardo/Raskin 1991; Attardo 1994), and now into the Ontological
   Semantic Theory of Humor (Raskin/Triezenberg 2005; Raskin 2009;
   Hempelmann 2009; Taylor 2009, 2010).
   The last theory is a work in (rapid) progress, and the last section of
   the paper will be devoted to a number of recent developments in blending
   the Ontological Semantic Technology our team is developing for Natural
   Language Processing applications with the improved and revised humor
   theory.
   Before we get there, however, we will discuss three major areas that are
   necessary for understanding, especially by scholars outside of
   linguistic semantics, what we have been doing and why. First, we will
   explain our understanding of theory, so that it not be confused with a
   reader's own interpretations and expectations and not lead, again and
   again, to the most surprising readings of what our theory of humor has
   done. Second, we will restate for those yet unexposed to either of them
   what exactly the Semantic Script-based Theory of Humor and the General
   Theory of Verbal Humor claim, what premises they use, what their goals
   are, and how they justify and evaluate themselves.
   In the last section of the paper on the Ontological Semantic Theory of
   Humor we will address a number of important issues, often subverting and
   revising the claims of its predecessors. The Semantic Script-based
   Theory of Humor claimed that the list of script oppositions was an extra
   piece of knowledge that it had to use along with regular semantic
   analysis, this making the Semantic Script-based Theory of Humor no
   longer a strict application of linguistic semantics to humor. We will
   demonstrate how the list actually folds onto Ontological Semantic
   Theory, so this disappears as an obstacle to the strict-application
   status of the Ontological Semantic Theory of Humor.
   Second, we will show that Ontological Semantic Theory offers a procedure
   for discovering the main script opposition in a joke, an algorithm that
   the Semantic Script-based Theory of Humor and General Theory of Verbal
   Humor described rather rigorously for a competent linguist, but
   apparently incomprehensibly to other, often enthusiastic adherents of
   the theories.
   We will also sketch out the contribution Ontological Semantic Theory can
   make to the still controversial Logical Mechanism Knowledge Resource of
   the General Theory of Verbal Humor. This will be an initial step, we
   hope, towards understanding how jokes are put together and what exactly
   their internal/false logics are.
   One side product of this paper is intended to be a better understanding
   by the non-linguists and atheoretical linguists in the humor research
   community as well as by any scholar interested in humor, what the
   linguists of humor do and what they don't, what they can deliver to
   these communities and what they cannot, and what to expect from our work
   and what to do on their own rather than writing misdirected, even if
   majorly entertaining, things about our work. We do not intend this paper
   to kill off all the Hollywood-strength conspiracy theories, mostly of
   European vintage, of how a bunch of us have been trying to dominate
   humor research and claim the firstborns from everybody else. We do
   apologize for trying to remove the fun stuff from humor research : we
   realize we are acting as killjoys and killsports; instead of joining the
   fun and games of discovering the subverting humanity and inexhaustible
   complexity of humor, we boringly persist in discovering the truth about
   how humor works.},

Abstract = {Collusion in auctions can take different forms, such as refraining from
   bidding. Certain aspects of highway procurement auctions facilitate
   collusive outcomes. We collect data on asphalt paving auctions conducted
   in Kentucky from 2005-2007. We determine the potential service area of
   each asphalt plant and potential bidders for each paving project. We
   analyze firms' bid participation decisions, including variables
   affecting costs as well as competitive and strategic effects. In many
   geographic markets where firms face only a few identifiable rivals,
   county boundaries serve as a coordinating mechanism for softening
   competition, significantly influencing firms' decisions whether and how
   much to bid.},

Title = {Influences of Recent Crises in the European Space on the Exercise of
   Certain Rights and Citizen Duties in Romania: A Sustainable Perspective
   Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Purpose: The highlighting of how current security issues (the economic
   crisis at the European/global level and the military crisis in
   Ukraine)-seen as factors of negative influence on sustainable
   development at the societal level-influence the level of willingness of
   young citizens (aged 18-35) in Romania, regarding the acceptance of
   restrictions/limitations on certain fundamental rights and freedoms, as
   well as the fulfillment of certain constitutional obligations in
   exceptional situations. It was considered opportune to conduct this
   study, given the fact that since the end of World War II, the European
   continent has not experienced such major security issues that combine
   specific aspects of military security with those specific to human
   security, and that generate negative effects on the community's efforts
   to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development.
   Methods: The study was based on an online questionnaire administered to
   a total of 826 individuals permanently residing in Romania, aged between
   18 and 35. The data were collected from 1 October to 15 October 2022, at
   a reasonable interval following the onset of the mentioned crises,
   assuming that the opinions of the interviewed individuals regarding
   their negative impact on sustainable development from the perspective of
   internal societal life are well-formed. The methods used include
   statistical analysis and focused on identifying and assessing the degree
   of acceptability of restrictions/limitations on certain fundamental
   rights and freedoms, as well as the willingness to fulfill certain
   constitutional obligations. Additionally, empirical research on the
   issue was conducted in accordance with the available bibliography.
   Results: The study reveals the respondents' level of perception
   regarding the impact on sustainable development of society, from an
   economic perspective, social well-being (41.33\%), and citizen safety
   (53.26\%), as a result of the global/European economic crisis. The
   consequences of this are strongly felt among the interviewed population
   (61.09\%), leading to a decrease in their trust in the state
   authorities' ability to manage the situation. The cause of the
   global/European economic crisis is complex, a large part of the
   respondents (41.21\%) believing that it is the result of a globally
   orchestrated conspiracy to reset the international order and reconfigure
   the poles of power, and more than 50\% of the respondents considering
   the conflict in Ukraine as the main source. A percentage of 29.28\% of
   the respondents consider that social solidarity at the level of the
   European Union (EU) is feasible to overcome the negative influences of
   multiple crises on domestic societal life, and 49.51\% of the
   respondents believe that Romania's EU membership is likely to contribute
   substantially to limiting the negative effects of the crisis in Ukraine.
   The restriction/limitation of certain fundamental rights and freedoms of
   citizens, as possible extreme measures for managing the effects of the
   mentioned crises at the national level, is accepted by a small
   percentage of respondents (15-20\%), while the willingness to fulfill
   certain constitutional obligations of citizens is present in
   approximately one-third of the interviewed population.
   Conclusions: In the context of the new global/European economic crisis
   and the military crisis in Ukraine, which impact the sustainable
   development of society and the community's efforts to promote peaceful
   societies, young citizens in Romania (aged 18-35) are deeply concerned
   about the preservation of fundamental rights and freedoms as stipulated
   in the Constitution of Romania. They demonstrate a low level of
   acceptance for the restriction/limitation of these rights and freedoms,
   even in exceptional situations of an economic or military nature. The
   same low degree of readiness is also found in the fulfillment of some
   fundamental constitutional duties of the citizens (loyalty to the
   country, defense of the country, etc.), in the case of adopting
   exceptional measures in the event of extending the military conflict in
   Ukraine.},

Abstract = {Disease outbreaks motivate human groups to engage in sensemaking efforts
   to give meaning to the event. These sensemaking processes often involve
   narratives framing where a disease comes from, how it spreads, and how
   to prevent and cure infections. At least four generic narratives are
   typically used as symbolic resources make sense of disease outbreaks: A
   medical science narrative and three lay narratives, i.e., (1) infectious
   disease as divine punishment, (2) infectious disease as caused by
   actions of outgroups (3) infectious disease as caused by evil elites.
   The contributions to this Special Issue are discussed in relation to
   this narrative sensemaking perspective.},

Abstract = {International criminal law (ICL) is legally plural, and not a single,
   unified body of norms. Trials for international crimes involve a complex
   dance between international and domestic criminal law, the specificities
   of which vary markedly from one forum to the next. To date, many
   excellent scholars have suggested that the resulting doctrinal diversity
   in ICL should be tolerated and managed under the banner of ``legal
   pluralism.{''} To our minds, these scholars omit a piece of the puzzle
   that has major implications for their theory-the law's history.
   Neglecting the historical context of the international and national
   criminal laws that have informed and continue to inform ICL leads to the
   uncritical adoption of criminal law doctrine as a proxy for diverse
   social, cultural, and political values. This is often a false equation
   that results in important normative distortions, with major implications
   for the field's self-image, function, and legitimacy. In particular,
   scholars and courts overlook that much criminal law doctrine globally is
   the result of either a colonial imposition or an ``unsuccessful{''}
   legal transplant. In this Article, we revisit a cross-section of this
   missing history to contribute to both legal pluralism and ICL. For the
   former, we demonstrate that there is nothing inherently good about legal
   pluralism, and that in some instances, a shift from its descriptive
   origins to a more normative managerialism risks condoning illegitimate
   law. For ICL, our historiography shows how partiality is embedded in the
   very substance of ICL doctrine, beyond just the politics of its
   enforcement. At one level, this realization opens up the possibility of
   renegotiating, at least in certain circumstances, a universal ICL that
   is actually more plural in terms of values and interests than doctrinal
   pluralism. At another, it suggests that institutions capable of trying
   international crimes need to do far more to step away from the ugly
   legal history they have inherited.},

Abstract = {Using 406 overcharge estimates, the study analyzes the impact of cartel
   characteristics and the market environment on the magnitude of
   overcharges attained by cartels in different geographic markets and
   during six antitrust law regimes starting from the 18th century. The
   median overcharge achieved by cartels is 20 percent of selling price. As
   predicted by cartel theory, market structure is an important determinant
   of the overcharge level. Markets where cartels have high market shares
   tend to have higher overcharges. The number of cartel participants and
   the size inequality among them are inversely related to the overcharge
   level. International cartels impose higher overcharges than domestic
   cartels. Overcharges attained in the US and European markets tend to be
   lower than overcharges achieved in the Asian markets and the rest of the
   world. Results on the impact of changes in the antitrust law environment
   over time on the size of cartel overcharges are mixed. However, there is
   some evidence indicating that the lowest overcharges are associated with
   the latest antitrust law period. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Sociological studies on imitation and crowds usually point to the late
   nineteenth-century French jurist and sociologist Gabriel Tarde as their
   forerunner. This article argues that a lively debate on those issues
   already existed in Europe in the late seventeenth century. A review of
   works by Hobbes, Spinoza, Malebranche and Locke will show how they
   commented upon the dangerous influence of charismatic leaders over
   excitable mobs or the ordinary occurrence of someone's opinions or
   manners being subsequently imitated by others until they become a new
   fashion. These four authors developed distinct approaches to the study
   of imitation and crowds. I call them the `authoritarian' (Hobbes), the
   `rationalist' (Malebranche), the `affective' (Spinoza) and the `liberal'
   (Locke) frames. The authoritarian and the rationalist approaches easily
   lead to dismissive or hostile views, while the affective and the liberal
   ones may open the way to more sympathetic (or at least practical)
   assessments. This study aims to show that: a) early modern discussions
   on imitation and crowds made a significant contribution to the formation
   of the field of social sciences; and b) these classical authors may
   still prove valuable for understanding imitation and crowds in the
   twenty-first century, in regard to the digital environment as well.},

Journal = {INFORMATION COMMUNICATION \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 14},
Abstract = {This article examines the multilingual audiences of Russian outlet RT on
   Facebook. RT is a state media outlet known for spreading strategic
   Kremlin narratives and disinformation in support of Russia's domestic
   and foreign policy objectives to large and multilingual global
   audiences. RT serves as a central pillar of the Russian information
   influence apparatus, and an instrument of both `soft' and `sharp power',
   the latter describing the use of information manipulation to interfere
   with foreign public spheres. While many studies have concentrated on the
   English-language content of RT to understand its impact on Western
   democracies, in this article, we examine the sharing of RT content
   across all six RT languages, and we investigate what audiences from the
   six language communities share RT content on Facebook. We find

Abstract = {For a long time, philosophers of science have expressed little interest
   in the so-called demarcation project that occupied the pioneers of their
   field, and most now concur that terms like ``pseudoscience{''} cannot be
   defined in any meaningful way. However, recent years have witnessed a
   revival of philosophical interest in demarcation. In this paper, I argue
   that, though the demarcation problem of old leads to a dead-end, the
   concept of pseudoscience is not going away anytime soon, and deserves a
   fresh look. My approach proposes to naturalize and down-size the
   concept, anchoring it in real-life doctrines and fields of inquiry.
   First, I argue against the definite article ``the{''} in ``the
   demarcation problem{''}, distinguishing between territorial and
   normative demarcation, and between different failures and shortcomings
   in science apart from pseudoscience (such as fraudulent or faulty
   research). Next, I argue that pseudosciences can be fruitfully regarded
   as simulacra of science, doctrines that are not epistemically warranted
   but whose proponents try to create the impression that they are. In this
   element of imitation or mimicry, I argue, lies the clue to their common
   identity. Despite the huge variety of doctrines and beliefs gathered
   under the rubric of ``pseudoscience{''}, and the wide range of defects
   from which they suffer, pseudosciences all engage in similar strategies
   to create an impression of epistemic warrant. The indirect, symptomatic
   approach defended here leads to a general characterization of
   pseudosciences in all domains of inquiry, and to a useful diagnostic
   tool.},

Title = {How to distinguish a ``scientoskeptic{''} from a
   ``scientoenthusiast{''}? Psychometric properties and criteria for
   qualitative interpretation of the scores of the Views of Science
   Questionnaire in a Polish quota sample},
Journal = {CURRENT ISSUES IN PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {66-83},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   The main aim of this study was to develop criteria for qualitative
   interpretation of the scores of the Views of Science Questionnaire
   (VoSQ), which is a tool for measuring the level of scientistic
   worldview. Another goal was to verify the psychometric properties of the
   tool in an adequately large and demographically diverse sample.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   The study involved 1,119 participants aged 18 to 87 who filled in the
   Polish version of the VoSQ via the Internet. The obtained results were
   subjected to reliability analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and
   analyses aimed at developing criteria for the qualitative interpretation
   of both individual and group scores of the VoSQ scales.
   RESULTS
   The CFA analysis showed a satisfactory level of fit of the VoSQ factor
   structure containing one higher-order factor and four sub-factors. The
   reliability of the tool scales was also satisfactory. The obtained
   results showed gender and age differences, but no differences related to
   the level of education. This information was used to develop the
   percentile-based criteria for the interpretation of the individual
   scores and the mean and standard deviation-based criteria for
   qualitative interpretation of the group scores.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The relationship between science and its social reception is becoming an
   increasingly important issue. The development of criteria for the
   qualitative interpretation of the results of the Views of Science
   Questionnaire makes it possible to use it as a tool for diagnosing
   attitudes towards science, displayed by both individuals and groups.
   This knowledge may be useful in improving the effectiveness of social
   implementation.},

Abstract = {Using a multi-methodological approach, we analyze member comments in
   Watts Up With That (WUWT), a climate skeptical Facebook group.
   Quantitative topic modeling revealed that members claim hyperrationality
   to undermine climate science. Science-based terms were often connected
   to other topics, such as immigration and LGBTQ+ rights, creating
   rhetorical constellations that shifted rhetoric from technical spaces
   into political and ideological ones. These findings have implications
   for dealing with the challenge of misinformation's circulation on social
   media.},

Abstract = {The success of the alpha-beta algorithm in game playing has shown its
   value for problem solving in artificial intelligence, especially in the
   domain of two-person zero-sum games with perfect information. Still,
   there are different algorithms for game-tree search which challenge the
   value of the alpha-beta algorithm. This paper describes and assesses the
   alternatives proposed according to how they try to overcome the
   limitations of alpha-beta. We conclude that for computer chess no
   practical alternative exists, but many promising ideas have good
   potential to change that in the future.},

Abstract = {BackgroundIdentifying common factors that affect public adherence to
   COVID-19 containment measures can directly inform the development of
   official public health communication strategies. The present
   international longitudinal study aimed to examine whether prosociality,
   together with other theoretically derived motivating factors
   (self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility and severity of COVID-19,
   perceived social support) predict the change in adherence to COVID-19
   containment strategies.MethodIn wave 1 of data collection, adults from
   eight geographical regions completed online surveys beginning in April
   2020, and wave 2 began in June and ended in September 2020. Hypothesized
   predictors included prosociality, self-efficacy in following COVID-19
   containment measures, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, perceived
   severity of COVID-19 and perceived social support. Baseline covariates
   included age, sex, history of COVID-19 infection and geographical
   regions. Participants who reported adhering to specific containment
   measures, including physical distancing, avoidance of non-essential
   travel and hand hygiene, were classified as adherence. The dependent
   variable was the category of adherence, which was constructed based on
   changes in adherence across the survey period and included four
   categories: non-adherence, less adherence, greater adherence and
   sustained adherence (which was designated as the reference
   category).ResultsIn total, 2189 adult participants (82\% female, 57.2\%
   aged 31-59 years) from East Asia (217 {[}9.7\%]), West Asia (246
   {[}11.2\%]), North and South America (131 {[}6.0\%]), Northern Europe
   (600 {[}27.4\%]), Western Europe (322 {[}14.7\%]), Southern Europe (433
   {[}19.8\%]), Eastern Europe (148 {[}6.8\%]) and other regions (96
   {[}4.4\%]) were analyzed. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression
   analyses showed that prosociality, self-efficacy, perceived
   susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 were significant factors
   affecting adherence. Participants with greater self-efficacy at wave 1
   were less likely to become non-adherence at wave 2 by 26\% (adjusted
   odds ratio {[}aOR], 0.74; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.77; P < .001), while those
   with greater prosociality at wave 1 were less likely to become less
   adherence at wave 2 by 23\% (aOR, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.75 to 0.79; P =
   .04).ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that in addition to
   emphasizing the potential severity of COVID-19 and the potential
   susceptibility to contact with the virus, fostering self-efficacy in
   following containment strategies and prosociality appears to be a viable
   public health education or communication strategy to combat COVID-19.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BALTIC STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 3},
Abstract = {The segregation of consumption between the Russian- and
   Estonian-speaking populations residing in Estonia has been common
   knowledge in the popular imagination, mass media publications, and
   academic papers. Rather than undertaking an impossible mission to
   identify whether these narratives are true, in this article, I show how
   this repertoire of stories has fostered special marketing strategies and
   document the emergence of a special marketing niche of companies
   promising to teach how to market products to mainstream or minority
   consumers based on their presumed mental differences. Deriving from
   ethnographic fieldwork, I demonstrate how mythologies about ethnic
   segregation in consumption paradoxically result in integration.},

Title = {Vaccine Hesitancy and the Concept of Trust: An Analysis Based on the
   Israeli COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign},

Abstract = {This paper examines the trust relations involved in Israel's COVID-19
   vaccination campaign, focusing on vaccine hesitancy and the concept of
   `trust'. The first section offers a conceptual analysis of `trust'.
   Instead of analyzing trust in the vaccination campaign as a whole, a few
   objects of trust are identified and examined. In section two, the
   Israeli vaccination campaign is presented, and the focus is placed on
   vaccine hesitancy. In section three, different trust relations are
   examined: public trust in the Israeli government and health
   institutions, interpersonal trust in healthcare professionals and
   experts, trust in the pharmaceutical companies that make the COVID-19
   vaccine, the US FDA, and trust in the new vaccine and the new
   technology. Through this complexity of trust relations, I argue that it
   is impossible to completely separate the trust that the vaccine is safe
   and effective from social aspects of mistrust. Additionally, practices
   of silencing and censoring the concerns of vaccine hesitaters - both
   experts and among the public, are pointed out. I contend that these
   cases further minimize vaccine hesitaters' trust in vaccine-related
   entities. In contrast, in section four, I suggest the `trust-based
   approach': since vaccine hesitancy is not solely the result of knowledge
   deficiency but also a lack of trust relations, any campaign that
   addresses vaccine hesitancy should also focus on trust. The advantages
   of this approach are spelled out. For governments, a discussion based on
   trust is, ultimately, the best democratic way to encourage hesitaters to
   take the plunge and get vaccinated.},

   diplomacy},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},
Number = {3-4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Russian climate policy debate pays special interest to the economic
   and political benefits and threats related to international climate
   policy. Applying critical discourse analysis, in this study, I dismantle
   issue discourses into sub-discourses, identifying six central themes,
   and then discuss the truth-value of the claims made. Policy decisions
   relevant to climate diplomacy are often in line with sub-discourses of
   low truth-value. Thus, socially constructed reality can go against
   statistical data and scientific research, setting the context for policy
   decisions and international climate cooperation. That makes it difficult
   to influence Russia's climate position or domestic policies by sharing
   knowledge. However, the sub-discourses also indicate a domestic debate
   on Russia's climate-diplomacy options-a debate of higher truth-value
   that may influence constructions of social reality. Thus far, the
   Russian government has managed to avoid costly domestic
   emissions-reduction measures. However, the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment
   Mechanism (CBAM) will impose carbon costs on Russian export products,
   forcing reconsideration of this social reality.},

   Stalinist rule},

Abstract = {During the Stalinist era by contrast to the Soviet Union and other East
   Bloc countries, Poland did not witness ``anti-Zionist{''} trials against
   activists of Jewish organizations or communist party activists of Jewish
   descent. Neither was there an eradication of Jewish cultural
   institutions. The reprisals against persons associated with Jewish
   institutions were anything but widespread.
   The purpose of this text is to describe one example of such reprisals.
   The victim is Aron Wahl (1893-1960), journalist, essayist and political
   activist. The imprisonment of Aron Wahl in 1949 was attributed both an
   his article published in Yidishe shriftn and to his political past
   before WWII.
   Aron Wahl was born in Drohobycz in 1893. In 1912 he was already the
   chairman of Poale Zion in Boryslaw. From 1922 he acted in Warsaw, was
   member of the Central Committee of Poale Zion Left and briefly its
   secretary.
   In 1926 Wahl jointed the Communist Party of Poland (KPP). He was a
   member of its Central Jewish Bureau and member of the editorial team
   producing the Party's Jewish-language publications. In 1932 he was
   detailed by the KPP to act in the General Jewish Workers' Party, where
   he was responsible, among other things, for publishing its Unzer weg
   paper.
   In the years 1934-1936 Wahl headed an opposition faction inside the KPP,
   whose most important document was the ``Memorial{''}, which criticized
   the lack of control over the party apparatchiki by the members of the
   banned party at large. The KPP leadership termed Wahl's group as
   ``Trotskyites{''}. Already after the Memorialists{''} discontinued their
   operations, in February 1937, Wahl was incarcerated in the concentration
   camp at Bereza Kartuska. There, due to his family problems, he signed a
   declaration of loyalty to state authorities. This led to the Communist
   periodicals branding him as a symbol of perfidious activities of
   Trotskyites who were allegedly in the pay of the police.
   Wahl survived the war in Warsaw's ghetto and subsequently on the Aryan
   side{''} of Warsaw. From 1945 he lived in LOd2. Occasionally he wrote
   for Jewish periodicals. He was a member of the Union of Jewish Writers
   and Journalists. The beginning of the end of his peaceful work in the
   Jewish literary community came with his critical review of Adam Schaff's
   Introduction to Marxist theory. It was printed in Yidishe shriftn in
   early 1949.
   Wahl's attack on a leading Marxist ideology specialist was the reason
   why the Yidishe shriftn editorial team was summoned to the Press
   Department of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, which
   was followed by the publishing of self-criticism and of a polemical
   article penned by Michal Mirski, accusing Wahl of Trotskyism.
   Then, on 6 November 1949, Wahl got arrested. The investigation was
   focussed on his pre-war activities. His trial began on 16 October 1951.
   According to the indictment, Aron Wahl, ``from 1934 to 1937 {[}...],
   acting in accordance with the interests of the Security Department of
   the Ministry of Internal Affairs, set up the Trotskyite group called
   ``the Memorialists{''}, devised and published its political programme,
   which denigrated the Communist Party of Poland, the aim of it being to
   sow dissent inside the revolutionary working class movement{''}.
   Wahl was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, but the sentence was at
   once commuted to four years and eight months under an amnesty.
   Ironically, Wahl shared a prison cell with Col. Waclaw Kostek-Biernacki,
   who in the years 1932-1939 was responsible for the organization and
   supervision over the Bereza Kartuska concentration camp.
   Aron Wahl fell into complete oblivion and did not live to see himself
   being rehabilitated. Some of the persons implicated in his condemnation
   and his trial were Szymon Zachariasz, Bernard Mark, Michal Mirski, Dawid
   Sfard, Binem Heller. This is why, as per our research, a conspiracy of
   silence was keept by those who contributed to his misfortune, even after
   they were sidelined after 1968. It was only Hersz Smolar that broke that
   silence in his memoirs, and even then only in a small measure.},

Abstract = {The Lezgin irredentist movement is one of the less-studied national
   movements in the post-Soviet space, despite affecting the strategically
   important Russian-Azerbaijani borderlands and the bordering process
   between the two post-Soviet states. This article aims to fill this gap
   and to examine the impact of the Lezgin national movement on the
   development of territorial nationalism in early post-Soviet Azerbaijan.
   Based on the analysis of media publications in three Azerbaijani
   newspapers between 1992 and 1996, I argue that the movement contributed
   to consolidating the territorial vision of the Azerbaijani nation as
   incorporating groups historically settled in this territory. While media
   coverage stressed friendship between ethnic Azerbaijanis and Lezgins,
   the responsibility for secessionist claims was placed on external
   forces, particularly Russia and Armenia. In the long term, this framing
   led to the securitization of ethnic minority activism as a major threat
   to Azerbaijani statehood.},

Abstract = {An unemployed, 60-year-old Singaporean gentleman died during a brief
   overseas trip to another South-East Asian country. He had, presumably,
   drowned in the bathtub of his hotel room, which he shared with his then
   44-year-old companion, who was supposedly his nephew.
   The relevant public health and medico-legal authorities of the host
   country conducted an external examination of the body at the scene,
   whereupon they agreed with the police that his death was probably due to
   accidental drowning following an episode of syncope. It would appear
   that this verdict was based almost entirely on circumstantial and
   hearsay evidence. No autopsy was performed. In its place, considerable
   reliance was placed on the observation that abdominal compression
   resulted in the outflow of a small amount of water from the mouth, as
   being proof of drowning. A few days later, the body was cremated in the
   host country and the remains (ashes) were subsequently repatriated to
   Singapore.
   It later transpired that, shortly before they embarked on the ill-fated
   trip, the deceased's `nephew' had purchased, on the former's behalf,
   travel insurance policies (covering accidental injury and death)
   amounting to a total of S\$800,000 from five different insurance
   companies, as well as a separate life policy for a further S\$100,000,
   most of which had been issued within the fortnight prior to their
   departure. Interestingly, the beneficiary (later the plaintiff in the
   ensuing civil trial some three years later) of all of these policies,
   was the ex,wife of the deceased's `nephew', with whom he had, in fact,
   continued to live although they were officially divorced several years
   ago. Whilst the claim against the life policy had been settled, the
   first five insurers declined to issue payment on grounds of suspicion
   that the deceased had been the victim of a homicide, planned or executed
   by the `nephew', wherein the beneficiary was a conspirator of sorts.
   The author was approached by defence counsel (representing the various
   insurers), for assistance in this matter. It was felt that a proper
   forensic review was seriously hampered by the lack of a full autopsy
   which would have been indispensable in ascertaining the actual cause of
   death and in eliminating other possibilities, apart from drowning, such
   as death from natural causes, other forms of injury, poisoning, or
   homicide. It was also emphasized that the mere presence of ingested
   water is not diagnostic of drowning.
   Eventually, after a protracted but unsuccessful attempt at mediation (in
   the course of which, the plaintiff rejected the offer of a reduced,
   although apparently sizable quantum), the matter came before the High
   Court, which found in favour of the defendants. It appeared that the
   judge was more than convinced that the deceased was indeed the victim of
   a homicide of which the plaintiff was a conspirator and her ex-husband,
   the perpetrator, as even a cursory perusal of the written judgement
   would indicate. Accordingly, the court ruled that the plaintiff (in her
   capacity as both the beneficiary of the insurance policies and executor
   of the estate) and her ex-husband had, effectively, deprived the
   insurers of their contractual right (as stipulated in the insurance
   policies) to have an autopsy conducted on the body of the deceased and
   they were, therefore, entitled to deny liability.
   This case illustrates the difficulties inherent in conducting an
   independent review of a putative instance of drowning, where convincing
   and reliable forensic evidence and documentation are largely wanting;
   this being compounded by its occurrence in a foreign jurisdiction whose
   medico-legal practices differ substantially from that to which one is
   accustomed. It may even be said that the corpus delecti was destroyed,
   in this instance, by cremation. It is also unusual in that a de-facto
   finding of murder was made in a civil court (whose standard of proof is
   that of a balance of probabilities) and that this had, subsequently,
   spurred the police to undertake a criminal investigation for conspiracy
   to murder. In the event, the civil appeal was dismissed by the Court of
   Appeal, but no charge was laid against any of the suspects for want of
   sufficient forensic or investigative evidence of a criminal offence
   having been committed.},

Title = {The identity crisis in the Reichswehr: its influence on and reflection
   in the Estonian Army in 1919-1934},
Journal = {AJALOOLINE AJAKIRI-THE ESTONIAN HISTORICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-131},
Abstract = {Relations between the army of the Weimar Republic (Reichswehr) and state
   authorities of Germany are characterised by the formula ``a country
   within a country{''} and as such can be regarded as a classical example
   of interconnection between the military and civil society. Based on the
   Reichswehr example, it is possible to analyse interconnections between
   the army and the state in Estonia during the interwar period in order to
   determine the role played by the army in Estonia's political life and
   the impact it had on state government. To achieve this goal, it is
   necessary to characterise the main problems in relations between the
   Reichswehr and state authority and to ascertain the attitude towards the
   Reichswehr in the Estonian Army as represented by the central media of
   the army - the journal Sodur (Soldier).
   Limitations set at the Paris Peace Conference, the creation of the
   Reichswehr itself and its attitude towards the democratic republic all
   together created a military identity crisis in which several separate
   aspects are discernible. Firstly, the defeat of Germany in World War I
   was seen by officers of the Reichswehr as the result of a political
   conspiracy of ``internal enemies{''}, which was demonstrated by the
   November revolution of 1918 and created a narrative of defeat, and at
   the same time - the ideological basis for revanche. Secondly, a closed
   system of army recruitment and general isolation from ``politically
   corrupt{''} civil society created the effect of army elitism, which was
   intensified by the high percentage of nobility and descendants from
   hereditary military families among the officers.
   Estonia did not have a military representative in Berlin or direct
   contacts with the German Army until 1936. Nevertheless, questions
   related to developments in the Reichswehr were rather substantially
   discussed in the journal Sodur. The Estonian Army observed problems and
   developments in the Reichswehr, drawing mostly on information from the
   German or other foreign press, which resulted in an inaccurate
   understanding of several matters.
   Comparatively numerous articles were devoted to tactical development in
   the Reichswehr, giving detailed analysis of military training of
   officers and soldiers, the conducting of manoeuvres, and technical
   equipment. The Estonian military press gave a positive assessment of
   Germany's generals, especially Paul von Hindenburg and the Chief of Army
   Command Hans von Seeckt. The ``national upbringing{''} of German youth
   that was implemented by different public and political organisations in
   Germany was also presented in a positive light. It must be noted that
   the attitude of the Estonian military towards the Reichswehr changed as
   Adolf Hitler and the national-socialists gained power.
   Pro-German orientation among army leadership in Estonia increased after
   the coup of March 1934 and the appointment of Lieutenant General Nikolai
   Reek as Chief of the Estonian General Staff. Notwithstanding his
   participation in the First World War and the War of Independence against
   the Germans, and his education in a military academy in France during
   the 1920's, Reek already believed in 1929 that the Reichswehr's military
   training based on the principle of quality, as well as principles
   Germans used to train both higher and lower ranking officers provided a
   suitable model for reforms in the Estonian Army. Such reforms became
   possible only after March of 1934 and subsequent closer cooperation with
   Germany in military matters.
   Much like the Reichswehr, the Estonian Army suffered from the political
   influence of different political parties. The most dangerous was
   believed to be the influence of the Estonian Communist Party in 1924,
   which operated underground and under directions from Soviet Russia.
   Estonia's military counter-intelligence also believed the activities of
   communists in the border city of Narva and the military base of the
   First Infantry Division in 1923 to be interconnected with revolutionary
   events in Germany.
   Another political force that exerted influence on the Estonian Army was
   the right wing radical organisation known as the Union of Participants
   in the Estonian War of Independence (the so called Vaps Movement). This
   organisation, like the German NSDAP or Stahlhelm, united in itself not
   only war veterans and ethnic nationalists, but also many officers. As a
   result of the coup of March 1934, the Vaps Movement was disbanded and
   politically motivated purges began among army personnel. Several tens of
   officers were transferred to reserve forces or to other units, or even
   tried in court.},

Abstract = {This study identified the psychological and cognitive factors that
   predispose people to believe in neuromyths (e.g., the belief that we
   only use 10\% of our brain) and in cognitive enhancement (e.g., the
   belief that brain stimulation devices can enhance cognition). A new
   scale to measure belief in neuromyths and cognitive enhancement was
   developed and validated. Belief in neuromyths was related to a more
   intuitive (compared to an analytical) thinking style, a stronger need
   for cognitive closure, a simpler view of epistemic cognition,
   endorsement of a fixed mindset, and it was inversely related to
   scientific literacy. Belief in cognitive enhancement was specifically
   related to the endorsement of a growth mindset. No clear effect of the
   presence or absence of brain pictures on credibility ratings for
   neuroscientific explanations and intuitive thinking was found. These
   findings suggest that belief in neuromyths and cognitive enhancement is
   a multifaceted phenomenon and that interventions to foster public
   understanding of neuroscience could be aimed at affecting thinking
   styles.},

Title = {Barriers to patient-centered human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care
   with African American patients who use drugs: Social construction of the
   typical and ideal care visit},
Journal = {SUBSTANCE ABUSE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {205-212},
Abstract = {Background: A successful patient-provider relationship ensures that
   patients are treated as individuals and receive appropriate care for
   their unique circumstances. For this to occur, the relationship needs
   open communication and trust. African American persons who inject drugs
   (PWIDs) and who smoke crack cocaine are at elevated risks of poor health
   outcomes and are often lost to care. In addition, providers often
   experience difficulty serving this population. Although some barriers
   are documented in the peer-reviewed literature, this study sought to
   provide in-depth context to the relationship and how it is constructed.
   Methods: Individual, semistructured interviews were conducted with human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care providers and their patients,
   specifically PWIDs and persons who smoke crack cocaine, in publicly
   funded HIV clinics in low-resource urban communities. n = 31 patients
   and n = 7 providers were interviewed about their perceptions of the
   other and the relationship. Interview transcripts were coded and
   analyzed for common themes, which were used to generate a conceptual,
   constructionist model of the HIV care visit. Results: Common patient
   themes included the tendency to describe providers in familial terms,
   match between their current provider and ideal provider, concern about
   stigma related to their use, and expression of unmet needs. Provider
   themes revealed less match with their ideal patientpreferring patients
   who were both abstinent and adherent, and expressing frustration with
   patient refusal to change. Conclusions: Thematic results were used to
   create a visual and conceptual model for the HIV care visit. The model
   demonstrates both the positive and negative perceptions that inform the
   visit, and the barriers that impede a more fruitful patient-provider
   dynamic with a shared power structure. Provider training in
   communication and other identified topics may begin to lay the
   foundation for a shift in this structure.},

Title = {Structure, multiplexity, and centrality in a corruption network: the

Abstract = {The present study is an analysis of a Czech political corruption network
   known as the Rath affair reconstructed with publicly available data. We
   argue that for the study of criminal networks it is fruitful to follow a
   multiplex approach, i.e., to distinguish several interdependent network
   dimensions and study how they are interrelated. Relational elements in
   corruption are identified, and we propose three dimensions that are
   essential for understanding the Rath network: pre-existing ties (e.g.,
   marriage or co-membership of the same party), resource transfer (e.g.,
   bribing), and collaboration (e.g., communication). The aim of the study
   was threefold. We aimed to examine if the network exhibits the
   core/periphery structure, to investigate the multiplex structure of the
   network by assessing the overlap of the main dimensions of the network,
   and to determine the central and multiplex actors while considering the
   differentiation of centrality according to the three network dimensions.
   The core/periphery model appears to have a perfect fit to the aggregated
   network, leading to a four-block adjacency matrix. Studying the
   frequency of ties in these blocks shows that collaboration ties are
   present in all the blocks, while resource transfer ties are mainly
   located between the core and periphery, and pre-existing ties are rare
   generally. We also identify central actors, none of which are
   strategically positioned, occupying more visible positions instead. The
   majority of actors display strong multiplexity in the composition of
   their own ties. In the conclusion the potential usefulness of multiplex
   descriptive measures and of mixed methods approaches, implications of
   our results for trust incriminal networks, and potential merits of
   analytical sociology approach are discussed.},

Abstract = {In March 1764 George Grenville announced plans to raise revenues in
   America for colonial defence with stamp duties. Opinions differ about
   why Grenville then postponed the Stamp Act until a year hence. Writing
   in 1950, Edmund S. Morgan found the decision puzzling. Peter D.G. Thomas
   and John L. Bullion subsequently offered procedural explanations.
   Grenville envisaged the Stamp Act as a firm precedent for parliament's
   authority to impose direct taxation ('inland duties') in the colonies -
   a prospect that terrified Americans schooled in the common law, alert to
   dangerous precedents, and already prone to slippery-slope reasoning.
   With the mundane details of the Stamp Act unavailable until after its
   passage, however, the postponement also raised imperial debate to a
   level of abstraction from which it never retreated. Grenville's
   postponement of the Stamp Act foreclosed prospects for compromise and
   set British imperial policy on a course that ultimately fomented the
   American Revolution.},

Title = {HIV/AIDS and African American Men: Urban-Rural Differentials in Sexual
   Behavior, HIV Knowledge, and Attitude Towards Condoms Use},

Abstract = {Objectives: We assessed the differences and similarities in knowledge,
   attitude, beliefs, myths, and misconceptions; and the various high-risk
   behavioral factors that influence the rate of infectivity of human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS among African American men in urban
   and rural communities of Mississippi.
   Methods: A cross-sectional sample survey was conducted on 466 African
   American men in 2 sites between 2005 and 2007. With the main outcome
   variables of knowledge, attitude/feelings, behavior/ practices, and
   potentials for behavior change, we administered a 64-item, ethnically
   sensitive, gender-specific instrument to the subjects via a
   person-to-person interview.
   Results: Of the 466 respondents (urban, 33\%; rural, 67\%), 70\%,
   14.4\%, and 16.6\%, respectively, were heterosexual, bisexual, and men
   who have sex with men (MSM). The number of the respondents' sexual
   pokers in the previous 12 months were: 1 to 2 (54\%), 3 to 4 (25.7\%),
   and 5 or more (20.2\%). Statistically significant differences were
   observed between the 2 populations on HIV knowledge (p < .001),
   HIV/sexually transmitted infection testing history (p < .001), sexual
   partners (p = .038), unprotected sexual intercourse with drug users (p <
   .001), unprotected casual sex (p < .001), intercourse in an open
   relationship or marriage (p < .001), and communication with potential
   sex partners regarding sexual limits prior to intercourse (p = .027).
   Conclusions: Although the level of HIV/AIDS knowledge and education were
   lower among urban than rural respondents, subjects' negative overall
   beliefs, attitude/feelings, behavior and potentials for behavioral
   change did not differ significantly among the African American men in
   the 2 communities.},

Title = {When Sociopolitical Events Strike Cultural Beliefs: Divergent Impact of
   Hurricane Katrina on African Americans' and European Americans'
   Endorsement of the Protestant Work Ethic},

Abstract = {Can a single, powerful sociopolitical event (government's response to
   Hurricane Katrina) produce changes in prevalent cultural beliefs such as
   the Protestant work ethic (PWE)? In a cross-sectional study conducted
   before, immediately after, and 5 months after Katrina (Study 1: Part a),
   in a longitudinal study tracking participants immediately after Katrina
   and 3 months later (Study 1: Part b), and in an experiment that primed
   thoughts about Katrina (Study 2), thinking about Katrina reduced African
   Americans' (but not European Americans') endorsement of the PWE.
   Preliminary evidence suggested that the shift in African Americans'
   endorsement of the PWE was due to lower trust in the government.},

Title = {Attitude and Behaviors towards SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination among Healthcare
   Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study from Poland},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Healthcare workers are particularly exposed to biological risk during
   their daily occupational activities. Nowadays, severe acute respiratory
   syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become one of the most
   widespread infectious agents. In the current study, we performed a
   survey on the attitude and behavior of Polish healthcare workers (HCW),
   which comprise physicians (MD) and administrative healthcare assistants
   (HA) towards the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. Our
   study involved 2300 subjects (42.17\% female; 10.96\% MD; 5.87\% HA).
   The evaluation was conducted using a Google Forms survey based on
   original questions and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items
   questionnaire. HCW significantly more often demonstrated their
   willingness to get vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the
   control group (82.95\% vs. 54.31\%, respectively). The main concern, as
   regards all groups, was the development of long-term side effects after
   getting COVID-19 vaccine. The study revealed that depression
   significantly affects the willingness to get vaccinated. The readiness
   was significantly strengthened by positive medical history of
   recommended vaccinations, fear of catching COVID-19, as well as fear of
   passing on the disease to the relatives. Overall, the percentage of HCW,
   who want to be vaccinated against COVID-19 remains unsatisfactory.
   Further works exploring this subject are needed to take a step closer to
   achieving the herd immunity in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {A well known logical loophole for Bell's theorem is that it relies on
   setting independence: the assumption that the state of a system is
   independent of the settings of a measurement apparatus probing the
   system. In this paper the implications of rejecting this assumption are
   studied from an operationalist perspective. To this end a generalization
   of the ontic models framework is proposed that allows setting
   dependence. It is shown that within this framework Bell's theorem
   reduces to the conclusion that no-signaling requires randomness at the
   epistemic level even if the underlying ontology is taken to be
   deterministic. The ideas underlying the framework are further used to
   defend setting dependence against the charges of being incompatible with
   free will and scientific methodology. The paper ends however with the
   sketch of a new problem for setting dependence: a necessary gap between
   the ontic and the epistemic level that may prevent the formulation of a
   successful setting dependent theory.},

Abstract = {Critical thinking skills are often assessed via student beliefs in
   non-scientific ways of thinking, (e.g, pseudoscience). Courses aimed at
   reducing such beliefs have been studied in the STEM fields with the most
   successful focusing on skeptical thinking. However, critical thinking is
   not unique to the sciences; it is crucial in the humanities and to
   historical thinking and analysis. We investigated the effects of a
   history course on epistemically unwarranted beliefs in two class
   sections. Beliefs were measured pre- and post-semester. Beliefs declined
   for history students compared to a control class and the effect was
   strongest for the honors section. This study provides evidence that a
   humanities education engenders critical thinking. Further, there may be
   individual differences in ability or preparedness in developing such
   skills, suggesting different foci for critical thinking coursework.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a novel threat and traditional and new
   media provide people with an abundance of information and misinformation
   on the topic. In the current study, we investigated who tends to trust
   what type of mis/information. The data were collected in Norway from a
   sample of 405 participants during the first wave of COVID-19 in April
   2020. We focused on three kinds of belief: the belief that the threat is
   overrated (COVID-threat skepticism), the belief that the threat is
   underrated (COVID-threat belief) and belief in misinformation about
   COVID-19. We studied sociodemographic factors associated with these
   beliefs and the interplay between attitudes to COVID-19, media
   consumption and prevention behavior. All three types of belief were
   associated with distrust in information about COVID-19 provided by
   traditional media and distrust in the authorities' approach to the
   pandemic. COVID-threat skepticism was associated with male gender,
   reduced news consumption since the start of the pandemic and lower
   levels of precautionary measures. Belief that the COVID-19 threat is
   underrated was associated with younger age, left-wing political
   orientation, increased news consumption during the pandemic and
   increased precautionary behavior. Consistent with the assumptions of the
   theory of planned behavior, individual beliefs about the seriousness of
   the COVID-19 threat predicted the extent to which individual
   participants adopted precautionary health measures. Both COVID-threat
   skepticism and COVID-threat belief were associated with endorsement of
   misinformation on COVID-19. Participants who endorsed misinformation
   tended to: have lower levels of education; be male; show decreased news
   consumption; have high Internet use and high trust in information
   provided by social media. Additionally, they tended to endorse multiple
   misinformation stories simultaneously, even when they were mutually
   contradictory. The strongest predictor for low compliance with
   precautionary measures was endorsement of a belief that the COVID-19
   threat is overrated which at the time of the data collection was held
   also by some experts and featured in traditional media. The findings
   stress the importance of consistency of communication in situations of a
   public health threat.},

Title = {I trust my immunity more than your vaccines: ``Appeal to nature{''} bias
   strongly predicts questionable health behaviors in the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {Health care policies often rely on public cooperation, especially during
   a health crisis. However, a crisis is also a period of uncertainty and
   proliferation of health-related advice: while some people adhere to the
   official recommendations, others tend to avoid them and resort to
   non-evidence based, pseudoscientific practices. People prone to the
   latter are often the ones endorsing a set of epistemically suspect
   beliefs, with two being particularly relevant: conspiratorial
   pandemic-related beliefs, and the appeal to nature bias regarding
   COVID-19 (i.e., trusting natural immunity to fight the pandemic). These
   in turn are rooted in trust in different epistemic authorities, seen as
   mutually exclusive: trust in science and trust in the ``wisdom of the
   common man{''}. Drawing from two nationally representative probability
   samples, we tested a model in which trust in science/wisdom of the
   common man predicted COVID-19 vaccination status (Study 1, N = 1001) or
   vaccination status alongside use of pseudoscientific health practices
   (Study 2, N = 1010), through COVID-19 conspiratorial beliefs and the
   appeal to nature bias regarding COVID-19. As expected, epistemically
   suspect beliefs were interrelated, related to vaccination status, and to
   both types of trust. Moreover, trust in science had both a direct and
   indirect effect on vaccination status through both types of
   epistemically suspect beliefs. Trust in the wisdom of the common man had
   only an indirect effect on vaccination status. Contrary to the way they
   are typically portrayed, the two types of trust were unrelated. These
   results were largely replicated in the second study, in which we added
   pseudoscientific practices as an outcome; trust in science and the
   wisdom of the common man contributed to their prediction only
   indirectly, through epistemically suspect beliefs. We offer
   recommendations on how to make use of different types of epistemic
   authorities and how to tackle unfounded beliefs in communication during
   a health crisis.},

Title = {An experimental investigation into the transmission of antivax attitudes
   using a fictional health controversy},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {215},
Pages = {23-27},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Rationale.: Although vaccines are an invaluable weapon in combatting
   diseases, they are often surrounded by controversy. Vaccine
   controversies usually arise with the claims of some parents or doctors
   who link vaccines to harmful outcomes. These controversies often
   negatively affect vaccination coverage.
   Objectives: This experiment simulated a vaccine controversy to
   understand which content features of vaccination-related information are
   well transmitted and how this transmission affects vaccine intention.
   Method: All participants (N = 64) read two conflicting views (pro- and
   anti-) about a fictional vaccine (`dipherpox vaccine'). These
   conflicting views were held by a parent and a doctor, whose views varied
   across conditions. This information was transmitted along linear chains
   of four participants who recalled it and the product of their recall was
   passed to the next participant within their chain. They also responded
   whether they would vaccinate or not.
   Results: The experience-based view held by the parent was better
   transmitted than the medical-based view held by the doctor, while the
   pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine views were similarly transmitted. Despite
   all the participants having neutral or positive attitudes towards
   vaccines in general, 39.1\% of them decided not to vaccinate.
   Nevertheless, vaccination attitude was the strongest predictor of
   vaccination intention. The less positive participants' attitudes were
   towards vaccines in general, the less likely they were to vaccinate
   against dipherpox after exposure to the controversy.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that vaccination campaigns may be made
   more effective by including personal experiences of the negative
   consequences of non-vaccination.},

Abstract = {The recent outbreak of viral zoonotic disease-monkeypox-caused by the
   monkeypox virus, has infected many people worldwide. This study aims to
   explore the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) concerning
   monkeypox among university students in Bangladesh. Data were collected
   using purposive snowball sampling from 887 university students through
   an online survey using Google Form. The participants were mostly in
   their twenties (M = 22.33 {[}SD 2.01] years), and they spent, on
   average, 2.59 {[}SD 1.91] hours/day on electronic and social media. The
   participants generally showed moderate knowledge (39.5\%), low attitude
   (25.1\%), and moderate practice (48.6\%) toward monkeypox, with 47.6\%
   having had a moderate KAP score. Findings further showed that personal
   attributes of university students, i.e., age, sex, year of schooling,
   residence, living status, geographical distribution, e.g., division,
   were statistically and significantly associated with knowledge,
   attitudes, and practices regarding monkeypox and overall KAP score. It
   is also apparent that health status, susceptibility to monkeypox, and
   exposure to social media were the most common factors significantly
   associated with knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding monkeypox
   and overall KAP score. The current study's findings underscore the need
   for developing appropriate information, education, and communication
   (IEC) materials and their dissemination, which could play an important
   role in reducing the risk of monkeypox and similar other infectious
   diseases, particularly among students in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {This study introduces a blazingly fast, no-loss expert system for
   tic-tac-toe using decision trees called T3DT, which tries to emulate
   human gameplay as closely as possible. It does not make use of any brute
   force, minimax, or evolutionary techniques, but is still always
   unbeatable. To make the gameplay more human-like, randomisation is
   prioritised and T3DT randomly chooses one of the multiple optimal moves
   at each step. Since it does not need to analyse the complete game tree
   at any point, T3DT is exceptionally faster than any brute force or
   minimax algorithm, this has been shown theoretically as well as
   empirically from clock-time analyses in this study. T3DT also does not
   need the data sets or the time to train an evolutionary model, making it
   a practical no-loss approach to play tic-tac-toe.},

Abstract = {Background Transmission of HIV in South Africa continues to be high due
   to a large proportion of individuals living with undiagnosed HIV. Uptake
   of HIV testing is influenced by a multitude of factors including the
   patient's knowledge and beliefs about HIV. Methods This study sought to
   quantify the impact of knowledge and attitudes on HIV testing acceptance
   in an emergency department by co-administering a validated HIV knowledge
   and attitudes survey to patients who were subsequently offered HIV
   testing. Results During the study period 223 patients were interviewed
   and offered HIV testing. Individuals reporting more negative overall
   attitudes (p = 0.006), higher levels of stigma to HIV testing (p <
   0.001), and individuals who believed their test was confidential (p <
   0.001) were more likely to accept an HIV test. Conclusions Interventions
   focused on improving patient perceptions around testing confidentiality
   will likely have the greatest impact on testing acceptance in the
   emergency department.},

Abstract = {The paper studies bidder behavior in simultaneous, continuous, ascending
   price auctions. We design and implement a ``collusion incubator{''}
   environment based on a type of public, symmetrically ``folded{''} and
   ``item-aligned{''} preferences. Tacit collusion develops quickly and
   reliably within the environment. Once tacit collusion developed, it
   proved remarkably robust to institutional changes that weakened it as an
   equilibrium of a game-theoretic model. The only successful remedy was a
   non-public change in the preference of participants that destroyed the
   symmetrically, ``folded{''} and ``item aligned{''} patterns of
   preferences, creating head-to-head competition between two agents
   reminiscent of the concept of a ``maverick.{''} (JEL L50, L94, D43).},

Abstract = {In recent years, there have been numerous calls by researchers to adopt
   multi-disciplinary and international perspectives to address the HIV
   pandemic. Meaningful and prudent public health policy should be based on
   sound empirical data and research. Henceforth, our study aims to
   contribute to the current literature by conducting a comprehensive
   global mapping and determine the landscapes of HIV/AIDS research
   covering the years between 1983 and 2017 Bibliometric and content
   analysis was used to describe trends in research productivity, usages.
   research collaborations, and clusters of research topics. Exploratory
   factor analysis. Jaccard's similarity index, and Ward dendrogram were
   applied to abstracts' contents to determine the development of
   interdisciplinary research landscapes. The United States of America
   continues to lead in research production and be main hub for author- and
   country-level collaborations. Research employing an epidemiological,
   social, and/or behavioral perspective for studying HIV/AIDS was found to
   dwarf in the presence of basic and biomedical HIV research.
   Interdisciplinary approaches to HIV research have been increasing with
   the creation of various research landscapes: strong constructs of
   studies examining health status, clinical responses, and HIV treatment,
   risk behaviors have been formed, while research topics relating to
   psycho-behavioral and cultural aspects as well as services have emerged
   along. To effectively prevent and control the disease, more researches
   are needed to provide culturally relevant and/or contextualized evidence
   of effective inter- ventions. It is also necessary to enhance the
   ability and partnership of local researchers as well as invest in
   research infrastructure at national and regional levels to implement
   high-quality studies since they are the ``gate-keepers{''} who could
   respond to local changes in a timely manner. These types of research
   could be a helpful guide for international donors, governments, and
   academicians to set up research priorities in target groups and
   settings, and to develop future research agendas globally.},

Title = {Machine Guns and literary Destruction Machines: The Trial of Eduard
   Limonov},
Journal = {SLAVICA TERGESTINA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {42-80},
Abstract = {The first section outlines the March 2001 arrests of National Bolshevik
   activists who had procured machine guns and explosives, obeying orders,
   it was claimed in the ensuing investigation, of their party leader, the
   cult-author Eduard Limonov, and Sergei Aksenov, editor in chief of the
   party newspaper Limonka. The two were subsequently arrested and accused
   not only of the illegal acquisition of weapons (Criminal Code of the
   Russian Federation (sic)222) but also of founding an armed group
   ((sic)205), of preparing acts of terrorism ((sic)205) and of instigating
   an uprising destructive of the constitutional order of the Russian
   Federation. The section outlines media reactions to the arrest of ``the
   well-known writer Limonov{''} and examines a polemical open letter
   composed behind bars by Limonov in which he accuses society of
   indifference. By comparing his own case with that of Iosif Brodsky and
   bringing discredit upon the latter, Limonov pursues the somewhat
   contradictory goals of appropriating the symbolic capital of the
   dissident movement and simultaneously destroying one of their central
   myths. The ``hypertrophied literary political nexus{''} (Parte 2004, 1)
   becomes manifest in its most aggressive incarnation: the
   writer-revolutionary.
   The second section goes back to Walter Benjamin's characterization of
   political radicalism among the bohemians of Baudelaire's Paris. It
   emphasizes Limonov's deeply felt kinship with Baudelaire, asking whether
   the former's project can be viewed as an instance of radical aesthetic
   subjectivity in the tradition of the avant-garde. To my mind, to decide
   whether Limonov's is really a political or merely an aesthetic project
   is too complex a problem to solve satisfactorily at the present time.
   Providing a summary of scholarly treatises on the problem, I argue that
   Walter Benjamin's notions of `aestheticization of politics' and war in a
   fascist context can serve as points of departure in future research.
   Another useful notion might be `myth'; it has been addressed on the one
   hand by French philosophers Nancy and Lacoue-Lebarthe, who further
   develop Benjamin's above mentioned notions, and on the other hand by
   Olga Matich in her psychoanalytically informed analysis of Limonov's
   more recent writing. Let me urge caution in the use of these leads, as
   we are dealing here with aesthetics, however irrational and repellent
   they might be, that are not state-controlled, but rather serve young
   people, freely representing their marginality.
   After thus bracketing larger questions, I devote the third chapter to
   the core interest of the article: the question as to whether Limonov's
   terrorism was judged to be a gory reality or the trial was merely and
   purposely addressing fiction. The strategy of the prosecution was to
   treat speech acts as signifying a bloody reality, while Limonov, facing
   several years in prison, suggested the speech acts' rhetorical nature.
   The court's decision followed Limonov's suggestion and acquitted him and
   Aksenev of the charges of terrorism and instigating an insurrection.
   Moreover it emphasized that the prosecution seemed rather inclined to
   construe a conspiracy.
   The last chapter explores in depth one of the main pieces of evidence
   brought forward by the prosecution: the ``Theory of a Second Russia.{''}
   This text, which was attributed to Limonov by the prosecution, but was
   in fact authored by a Latvian regional party leader, was published in
   party bulletin NBP-Info No3, devoted to the ideology and political
   perspectives of Eurasianism. The text imagines an uprising of the
   Russian minority in Kazakhstan and the building of a second free and
   wild Russian state that would in the long run conquer the first state.
   Limonov has emphasized that this text was received for a column of
   Limonka devoted to organizing a competition among proponents of
   revolutionary projects. This competition was announced by the
   post-/conceptualist poet Dmitry Pimenov, who himself contributed a
   couple of very surrealistic revolutionary projects. The competition, in
   encouraging imagination of the improbable, was a striking example of the
   then virulent blurring of literary and political genres. The exotic
   potential of the imaginary Second Russia imaginary is then further
   developed in Limonov's book of prison lectures, A Different Russia.
   Limonov's vision includes a touch of aestheticization of violence that
   is analyzed at the end of the article. I argue that a state in Limonov's
   myth is a violent father figure admired and loved at the same time, an
   ambivalence which makes positioning Limonov in the field of politics a
   difficult task.},

Abstract = {Humanist Giovanni Conversini alias Ivan Ravenjanin (1343-1408) spent his
   life in seeking a specific teaching or high-ranking state post - that
   is, he could not decide between family happiness on one side and
   retirement into seclusion and contemplation on the other. His personal
   meanderings prevented him from achieving his life goals: for years he
   remained at the court of the Carrara family in Padua, despite hostile
   intrigues against him, yet the fall of this dynasty after the Venetian
   invasion forced him to look for shelter elsewhere. He accepted an offer
   from Dubrovnik, where he worked as a public notary in the 1380s. He
   described his Dubrovnik experience in a writing today known as Historia
   Ragusii, composed in the form of a letter addressed to an unnamed friend
   on the inner Venetian territory.
   While the Ragusan Commune was still constructing its independent
   administrative apparatus, in the first decades following the end of
   Venetian rule, an expert such as Conversini (who attended a specialised
   course in Bologna, obtained a notary degree, in addition to twenty years
   of work experience) was more than welcome. Unfortunately, he found the
   work difficult for a number of reasons: the daily routine was wearing
   him out, he was not accustomed to frequent contacts with the clients and
   showed little understanding for the specific political system in
   Dubrovnik, in which a new rector was chosen every month. Monarchy was
   more to his liking, and he looked back nostalgically to the days spent
   in Padua where he served a single lord, as contrasted to the work of the
   Ragusan councils and their incessant discussions during the sessions to
   which he was officially appointed as notary.
   In his text he recurrently emphasised how frustrated he was with the
   backward environment he found himself in, considering that his
   contribution to the community was not credited accordingly. He regretted
   not having given proper consideration to the Ragusan offer before taking
   it, allowing himself to be driven ``among the barbarians{''}.
   Conversini's complaints may be viewed as justifiable since they do
   reflect a marked difference between the humanistic circle of the Italian
   north, to which he himself belonged and prided with his acquaintance
   with Petrarch, and Dubrovnik of the day.
   His discontent spilt over into general social issues, notably those
   related to religion and moral. Grounding his conclusions on a succession
   of selected works, from classical authors of the Antiquity to the Old
   and New Testament and patristic literature, Conversini came forward with
   his ethical principles based on pagan Neoplatonic and Stoic, but also
   JudaeoChristian views. However, his writing provides some concrete data
   on the Ragusan everyday life of that time. From the past, he touched
   upon the legend of the founding of Epidaurus, while he gave more space
   to the story of the tyrant count Damjan Juda, deposed in a conspiracy in
   the early thirteenth century.
   His service in Dubrovnik ended successfully, and several years later he
   received another offer by the Ragusan authorities, this time for the
   post of a high official of the Commune. This offer he refused, as he
   found the conditions in north Italy more acceptable. However, as
   witnessed by Conversini's autobiography written in his last days, his
   reminescences of Dubrovnik were awarded a fairly warmer tone.
   A prolific writer, Conversini has left several works of reflexive
   nature, resembling autobiography in terms of genre. His work was in the
   focus of his younger contemporaries and has attracted scholarly
   attention ever since. They should be credited for the critical editions
   of his texts, but also for the thorough reconstruction of his biography.
   The writing entitled ``The History of Dubrovnik{''} has not yet been
   fully published. The excerpts given in this article are drawn from a
   late transcript, held in the State Archives in Dubrovnik. This work was
   mentioned by the classical Ragusan authors Filippo Diversi in the
   fifteenth and Jakov Luccari in the seventeenth century. Yet,
   Conversini's hostile attitude towards the Ragusan society, his latent
   advocacy of the monarchical political system and his moraltheological
   style strawn with quotations contributed to his isolated literary
   position in Dubrovnik. Similarity with the Memoriale of the Zadar
   patrician Pavao Pavlovic has been established, a kind of an
   historiographical account in which he chronicled the events in Zadar
   from 1371 to 1408.
   The name of Giovanni Conversini and his work Historia Ragusii have
   become the symbols of criticism of the late medieval Ragusan society.
   Although not fully grounded, they still represent a welcome contrast to
   the typical humanistic praises which abounded in the later periods.},

Abstract = {In the early twentieth century, among the European ruling elites,
   military circles and imperial non-governmental organizations dominated
   afmvefill approach to resolving international conflicts. The focus was
   on the irreconcilable struggle for so-called ``national interests{''},
   on the need to change the world in their favor, on the undoubted
   advantage of interstate competition over cooperation, and on the use of
   force, above all, military. The absolute state priority was the
   capability to mobilize national resources to defend their
   ``interests{''}. The WWI for the realization of geopolitical dreams was
   a senseless waste of available resources. Its initiators, most notably,
   Germany, were guided by ideological rather than pragmatic considerations
   and obtained results that were in straight contrast to the calculations
   of their grand strategies. There were no rational foundations, such as
   solving basic economic, security, social, or any other problem among the
   causes of the war. Some prospered from preparing for the war. But it is
   futile to tempt the ``conspiracy{''} of gunsmiths, who sought the
   lucrative orders responsible for the war.
   The decisive factor that caused the war was the commitment to myths:
   about real but exaggerated or fictional ``national resentment{''}; on
   the ``inconsistency of the share of colonial possessions to the weight
   of the Empire in the world economy and politics{''}; ``backward peoples
   incapable to contribute to civilizational progress, their destructive
   nationalism{''}; ``cultural superiority, which must be extended if
   necessary by force{''}; ``security windows that should be closed
   immediately{''}; ``calls of blood. will and destiny{''}, etc.
   The process defining the national interests of states ignored economic
   factors that would determine their country's development, prosperity,
   and power. The so-called ``features of bipolarity{''} in the structure
   of the international system and the creation of two military-political
   blocs did not become a crucial factor Unions were poorly
   institutionalized, so the behavior of their members was ambivalent. The
   facts show that the Alliances' obligations could not have forced the
   state to act on one or the other side. The authorities of each country,
   at their discretion, approved the decision to join WWI. Italy, for
   example, betrayed its allies Germany and Austria-Hungary at the very
   time of the declaration of war.
   The roots of the war should be found in the views of the rulers,
   representatives, or servants of the old regime of the dynastic
   aristocracy. Their picture of the world somewhat corresponded to the
   realities of the nineteenth century and the historical epoch that
   preceded it with the dominance of geopolitical (spatial) ideas. At that
   time, such ideas had not yet completely lost their roots. But they
   fundamentally distorted the new world - the one to be set in the summer
   of 1914. The ruling imperial class was in crisis and was threatened by
   social and national upheavals. It was inclined to seek its salvation in
   a small victorious war at ``a small price{''}.
   How could it be that both sides were hoping for a quick victory?
   Regardless of the type of regime absolute or constitutional monarchy,
   democratic or authoritarian state - it seems that too often their top
   leadership had been grossly mistaken. Such mistakes led to catastrophic
   decisions about entering the war, choosing allies and forms, methods,
   and the extent of interaction with them. States had made considerable
   efforts to obtain clear sensitive information about their enemies. But
   the problem was in interpreting all these messages and in responding to
   them. In most cases, the heads of state ignored the intelligence or
   their realistic interpretation.
   Power holders were guided by a variety of factors, including groundless
   calculations, ideology, political expediency, personal prejudice, racial
   or ethnic stereotypes, and preferred to turn a blind eye to proven
   facts.
   WWI could have started before 1914. The states constantly threatened
   each other with their actions. Repeated attempts to strike the threat of
   aggression, although, in reality, its leadership was not planning to use
   military force at the moment, have undermined international stability.
   The efforts of the European leaders were not aimed at creating a
   sustainable military allied capability, united by a common strategy to
   achieve agreed goals.
   Diplomatic game prevailed: the parties bluffed, tried to play trumps,
   which they did not have, etc. Initial stakes, including colonial and or
   territorial encroachment on players, were negligible compared to the
   payout, which in many orders of magnitude exceeded them. As a result,
   the collapse of four empires took place: the Austro-Hungarian, Russian,
   German and Ottoman and two of the greatest totalitarian revolutions in
   Europe of the twentieth century - Russian (Bolshevik) and German (Nazi)
   had happened.
   The article is devoted to polemics with a wide range of scholars who
   adhere to other concepts of the roots of WWI.},

Abstract = {Several Investigatory and Hearings panels have been organized on behalf
   the University of Arizona at Tucson (UAT) at the request of Cusanovich,
   the Vice-President of Research and Dean of the Graduate College, to
   judge professor Marguerite Kay, one in the year 1997 which concluded
   that nothing was wrong with her and another in 1998, which concluded to
   her dismissal from the University. Not satisfied about the first results
   in 1997, Cusanovich, together with persons totally at his devotion
   declared a ``scientific misconduct{''} of this scientist, to have
   published papers ``not peer reviewed, badly written and full of
   faults{''}. I have in the actual paper, in a few phrases, demonstrated
   the inanity and the absolute falseness of all these ashaming
   accusations, all entirely forged by Kidwell and Tolbert, two professors
   of UAT, belonging to the staff of Cusanovich, at the order and totally
   at the devotion of Cusanovich, moreover ordered to forge proofs against
   professor Kay. I have not been permitted, thanks to the most subversive
   manoeuvers of the accusing panel, to afford my oral testimony in favour
   of Marguerite! The main prosecutor, Michael A. Cusanovich is entirely,
   but not he alone, at the origin of this denial of justice. Now all world
   has to learn that Cusanovich is not a recommendable individual, since he
   has been accused some time before of conspiracy, fraud and racketeering,
   for a sum of 53 millions dollars at the expense of a pharmaceutical
   company, Gibson-Stephens Neuropharmaceuticals, Inc. (46, 47), also for
   having paid illegal stipends to students (39) and finally to benefit
   personally from the University pay off as a shareholder in the company
   Selectide, what is totally illegal. This man has moreover excluded
   Marguerite Kay from her department and cut off her salary long before -
   about one year - any trial and any judgment had been afforded, having
   used the most illegal and tortuous methods to reach his goal. All this
   fraudulous behaviour has been realized together with another prosecutor
   called Cetas, the ``President of the Committee of Academic Freedom
   (sic!) and Tenure{''} or CAFT, which is illegally composed and is
   responsible of many infringements against the laws. I discovered that
   both prosecutors had introduced in the panel several members not elected
   as they should have been, but only appointed and as to conclude to a
   ``scientific misconduct{''} of professor Marguerite Kay. As it results
   from the several hundred written documents which I have discovered,
   together with other important independent contributions from diverse
   sides, this affair has been mounted against Marguerite Kay to uncover
   the mentioned irregularities of Cusanovich, using the most illegal
   methods and underground manoeuvers, of mafia type, to come to a ``good
   end{''}, for him naturally! A journalist, Tien Wei Yang, whose ``Letter
   to Editor{''} is published after my paper (44), has independently from
   my contribution, revealed many peculiar and trouble points in this
   affair. Two other members of the UAT, Carole Bernstein (3, 4) and
   William Bickel (6) have taken the defence of Professor Kay and
   demonstrated the innumerous irregularities of this illegally obtained
   decision to exclude her from the UAT. I conclude that such a situation
   is a return to the expeditive laws of the outlaws of the ``Wild West{''}
   exactly as it was at the time of the conquest, dominated by fear and
   terror, using the brief ``executive justice{''}, consisting in shoting
   down, on the spot, anybody who bared their way or opposed to their
   ``law{''}.
   Such people exist still to-day, without honour and without any respect
   towards the regular rules and Laws, they may be Local, Federal or
   National, manipulating them as pet their wish, creating from
   non-existing faults a ``scientific misconduct{''}, smashing with the
   feet the ``Human Rights{''}, and making perjury the year along.
   Altogether we claim Justice for Marguerite Kay, an innocent victim of
   some specific members of the Administration of this University, also of
   the definite diabolic and sadistic prosecutors, members of Investigation
   and Hearing panels. In that order, Professor Bickel has put the ``point
   of the organ{''} by demonstrating with an absolute logic that the
   unprincipled and illogic president of the University of Arizona, Peter
   Likins, a jumping jack without character has made a giant and
   unpardonable fault, in his tortuous undecisions and in all his
   contradictions, for not having permitted, and better said, not having
   decided to permit Marguerite Kay to go in appeal, so that, this time, on
   behalf of totally new and truly independent panels, whose members should
   be taken obligatorily from outside, in order to avoid all the actual
   innumerous concussions and irregularities, a true Justice may be
   rendered and professor Marguerite Kay fully reintegrated in all her
   functions, receiving as well the important damages which she is allowed
   to obtain.},

Abstract = {Past research indicates that existential threats related to meaning in
   life increase religious-related magical beliefs (e.g., belief in God).
   The present three studies examined more broadly whether threatened
   meaning influences magical ideation and beliefs among atheists and
   theists. Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 1,454) and student participants (N
   = 50) were randomly assigned to a meaning threat or control condition
   and then completed measures of magical ideation and beliefs. Across
   three studies (N = 1,504), we did not find experimental evidence that
   threatened meaning increases magical ideation and beliefs. However, in
   Study 3, we also examined the link between the meaning motive and
   magical ideation and beliefs using an individual difference approach and
   found that the need for meaning was a significant predictor of magical
   ideation and beliefs, particularly among atheists.},

Title = {Dealing with climate science denialism: experiences from confrontations
   with other forms of pseudoscience},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1094-1102},
Abstract = {Climate science denialism is a form of pseudoscience. This contribution
   provides proposals for how to counter it, based on previous research on
   the demarcation between science and pseudoscience and on the author's
   experience of tackling other forms of pseudoscience. Science denialism
   has much in common with other variants of pseudoscience, but it also has
   characteristics of its own. In particular, it is much more prone than
   other forms of pseudoscience to seek conflicts with genuine science.
   Like other science denialists, those attacking climate science have
   fabricated a large number of fake controversies in issues where there is
   no authentic scientific controversy. The defence of climate science
   against science denial has to take this into account. There is no reason
   to accept the denialists' agenda or to treat their claims as legitimate
   alternatives to science. Climate science should primarily be presented
   to the public in ways that are independent of denialist activities,
   rather than reactively in response to those activities. Disclosures of
   the strategies, motives and funding of denialism are important
   contributions to the public understanding of the fake controversies. It
   is also important to document the scientific consensus and make it
   known. The public defence of climate science is an important and urgent
   undertaking, and active contributions by as many scientists as possible
   are needed.Key policy insights Climate science denialism is a form of
   pseudoscience, and much can be learned from confrontations with other
   types of pseudoscience.The creation of fake controversies is a key
   strategy of climate science denialism. It is important to expose this
   strategy and not to accept denialists' choice of an agenda.Equal time'
   arrangements should be rejected since they put the truthful side at a
   disadvantage. It takes more time to refute a single lie than to deliver
   ten new ones.The experience from fighting tobacco science denialism
   shows that it is highly efficient to expose the hidden operations,
   funding and motives behind denialism.As many scientists as possible
   should take part in the public defence of climate science. This is one
   of the best ways to show our consensus.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the positioning and role of the Organisation of
   Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in relation to Public International Law, and
   how the OIC has sought to resolve two competing tensions: first, the
   defence and better promotion of the interests of generally Muslim States
   on the secular global stage; and second, effective representation of the
   interests of Muslims globally, following the collapse of the Ottoman
   Caliphate after the end of the First World War. The study is historical,
   contextual, and is written from a TWAIL perspective. It uses the case
   study of human rights to illustrate how historical tensions exacerbated
   by colonial structures through the frameworks of International Law have
   been resolved by a subordinated, Third World international organisation,
   and the state interests those resolutions have favoured. The article is
   partially descriptive, in response to the relative silence and lack of
   academic interest in the workings of the OIC. But it is also normative -
   an attempt to draw out a more pluralist, participative and inclusive
   form of Public International Law which, in traditional formulations,
   have and continue to marginalise the religious and Muslim voice.},

Abstract = {The aim of our study was to explore psychological determinants of
   COVID-19 responsible behavior. We focused on trait anxiety and worry
   about the corona crisis, knowledge and unfounded beliefs about
   coronavirus and thinking dispositions (cognitive reflection, actively
   open-minded thinking, faith in intuition and science curiosity) that
   should drive knowledge and beliefs. Additionally, we tested the
   effectiveness of a one-shot intervention based on the ``consider
   counter-arguments{''} debiasing technique in changing COVID-19 unfounded
   beliefs. We used a convenience sample of 1439 participants who filled in
   the questionnaire on-line. Comparison of latent means showed that the
   ``consider counter-arguments{''} intervention did not affect unfounded
   beliefs. Structural equation model, conducted on 962 participants with
   data on all variables, indicated that greater worry and weaker
   endorsement of COVID-19 unfounded beliefs lead to more responsible
   COVID-19 behavior. The relationship of trait anxiety and thinking
   dispositions with the criterion was mediated through the worry about
   COVID-19 and unfounded beliefs about COVID-19, respectively.},

Abstract = {This paper draws attention to a powerful human motive that has not yet
   been incorporated into economics: the desire to make sense of our
   immediate experience, our life, and our world. We propose that evolution
   has produced a `drive for sense-making' which motivates people to
   gather, attend to, and process information in a fashion that augments,
   and complements, autonomous sense-making. A large fraction of autonomous
   cognitive processes are devoted to making sense of the information we
   acquire: and they do this by seeking simple descriptions of the world.
   In some situations, however, autonomous information processing alone is
   inadequate to transform disparate information into simple
   representations, in which case, we argue, the drive for sense-making
   directs our attention and can lead us to seek out additional
   information. We propose a theoretical model of sense-making and of how
   it is traded off against other goals. We show that the drive for
   sense-making can help to make sense of a wide range of disparate
   phenomena, including curiosity, boredom, `flow', confirmation bias and
   information avoidance, esthetics (both in art and in science), why we
   care about others' beliefs, the importance of narrative and the role of
   `the good life' in human decision making. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Title = {From text to ties: Extraction of corruption network data from deferred
   prosecution agreements},
Journal = {DATA \& POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Abstract = {Deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) are a legal tool for the nontrial
   resolution of cases of corruption. Each DPA is accompanied by a
   Statement of Facts that provides detailed and publicly available textual
   records of the given cases, including summarized evidence of who was
   involved, what they committed, and with whom. These statements can be
   translated into networks amenable to social network analysis allowing an
   analysis of the structure and dynamics of each case. In this study, we
   show how to extract information about which actors were involved in a
   given case, the relations and interactions among these actors (e.g.,
   communication or payments), and their relevant individual attributes
   (gender, affiliation, and sector) from five Statements of Fact. We code
   the extracted information manually with two independent coders and
   subsequently, we assess the inter-coder reliability. For assessing the
   coding reliability of nodes and attributes, we use a matching
   coefficient, whereas for assessing the coding reliability of ties, we
   construct a network from the coding of each coder and subsequently
   calculate the graph correlations of the two resulting networks. The
   coding of nodes and ties in the five extracted networks turns out to be
   highly reliable with only slightly lower coding reliability in the case
   of the largest network. The coding of attributes is highly reliable as
   well, although it is prone to missing data on actors' gender. We
   conclude by discussing the flexibility of our data collection framework
   and its extension by including network dynamics and nonhuman actors
   (such as companies) in the network representation.},

Abstract = {Systems thinking is thought to facilitate complex decision-making, but
   relatively little is known about its psychological underpinning. We
   present three studies that situate a measure of the construct in
   relation to other dispositional measures that have received more
   attention in environmental psychology and by testing whether the mindset
   predicts behavior in a set of novel decision making tasks. In Study 1,
   we find that systems thinkers tend to believe in scientific consensus,
   recognize risks posed by climate change, and support policy
   interventions to address climate change; systems thinking was negatively
   related to conspiracist and free-market ideation. In Studies 2 and 3 we
   find that systems thinkers ascribe more value to the natural world -
   both in monetary terms as well as on social and ecological grounds. The
   findings suggest that models of environmental cognition can be improved
   by measuring peoples' tendency to engage in systems thinking. (C) 2016

Abstract = {We analyze 15 German cartels, focusing on the personal characteristics
   of the individual participants, the methods and frequency of
   communication as well as the internal organizational structures within
   the cartels and their eventual breakup. Our results indicate that cartel
   members are highly homogeneous and often rely on existing networks
   within the industry, such as trade associations. Most impressively, only
   two of the 158 individuals involved in these 15 cartels were female,
   suggesting that gender plays a role for cartel formation. We further
   identify various forms of communication and divisions of
   responsibilities and show that leniency programs are a powerful tool in
   breaking up cartels. Based on these results we discuss implications for
   competition policy and further research.},

Abstract = {This article explores belief in political rumors surrounding the health
   care reforms enacted by Congress in 2010. Refuting rumors with
   statements from unlikely sources can, under certain circumstances,
   increase the willingness of citizens to reject rumors regardless of
   their own political predilections. Such source credibility effects,
   while well known in the political persuasion literature, have not been
   applied to the study of rumor. Though source credibility appears to be
   an effective tool for debunking political rumors, risks remain. Drawing
   upon research from psychology on `fluency' - the ease of information
   recall - this article argues that rumors acquire power through
   familiarity. Attempting to quash rumors through direct refutation may
   facilitate their diffusion by increasing fluency. The empirical results
   find that merely repeating a rumor increases its power.},

Title = {`Blurred boundaries': When nurses and midwives give anti-vaccination
   advice on Facebook},
Journal = {NURSING ETHICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {552-568},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: Nurses and midwives have a professional obligation to
   promote health and prevent disease, and therefore they have an essential
   role to play in vaccination. Despite this, some nurses and midwives have
   been found to take an anti-vaccination stance and promulgate
   misinformation about vaccines, often using Facebook as a platform to do
   so. Research question: This article reports on one component and dataset
   from a larger study - `the positives, perils and pitfalls of Facebook
   for nurses'. It explores the specific issue of nurses and midwives who
   take an anti-vaccination stance, deemed to be unprofessional by crossing
   professional boundaries and by providing medical information on Facebook
   that is not within their scope of practice. Participants: Data were
   collected via an online worldwide survey from nurse and midwife
   participants, distributed and `snowballed' through relevant nursing and
   midwifery groups on Facebook. In total, 1644 Registered Nurses and
   Midwives, and Enrolled Nurses worldwide attempted the online survey.
   There were 1100 (66.9\%) completed surveys and 54 partially (33.1\%)
   completed surveys. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted online
   using Skype (R) with 17 participants in Australia. Ethical
   considerations: Ethical processes and procedures have been adhered to
   relating to privacy, confidentiality and anonymity of the participants.
   Findings/results: A mixed-methods approach was used, including
   descriptive and content analysis of the quantitative survey data and
   thematic analysis of the qualitative interview data. The main theme
   `blurred boundaries' was generated, which comprised three sub-themes:
   `follow the science, `abuse of power and erosion of trust' and `the
   moral and ethical responsibility to safeguard public health'. The
   results offer an important and unique understanding of how nurses and
   midwives interpret the conduct of fellow health professionals as
   unprofessional and crossing the professional boundary if they used
   Facebook to promulgate anti-vaccination messages and/or give medical
   advice online. Conclusion: There are many positives and negatives for
   nurses and midwives associated with using Facebook for personal and
   professional communication, which is in keeping with the results of the
   larger study from which this article is taken. Professional behaviour is
   a key theme in the larger research as is the ethical construct of `every
   act has a consequence'; however, in this article, the theme `blurred
   boundaries' offers an overall understanding of how nurses and midwives
   interpret the behaviour of their colleagues who espouse anti-vaccination
   sentiment and/or give medical advice online that is outside their scope
   of practice and education.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the health disparities and
   structural racism among African Americans. We examined overlaps between
   the COVID-19 pandemic and HIV epidemic using an intersectional stigma
   framework through the lens of Critical Race Theory. Intersectional
   stigma, medical mistrust, and decreased likelihood of referral for HIV
   and COVID-19 testing leads to decreased engagement in the healthcare
   system. Social inequities increase health disparities and lead to
   increased rates of chronic diseases, which increases the risk and
   severity of COVID-19. Solutions to mitigate impact among African
   Americans include increasing engagement regarding African American
   health, funding, and providers of color.},

Title = {Attitudes, perceptions, and preferences towards SARS CoV-2 testing and
   vaccination among African American and Hispanic public housing
   residents, New York City: 2020-2021},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},

Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {BackgroundAfrican American and Hispanic populations have been affected
   disproportionately by COVID-19. Reasons are multifactorial and include
   social and structural determinants of health. During the onset and
   height of the pandemic, evidence suggested decreased access to SARS
   CoV-2 testing. In 2020, the National Institutes of Health launched the
   Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx)- Underserved Populations
   initiative to improve SARS CoV-2 testing in underserved communities. In
   this study, we explored attitudes, experiences, and barriers to SARS
   CoV-2 testing and vaccination among New York City public housing
   residents. MethodsBetween December 2020 and March 2021, we conducted 9
   virtual focus groups among 36 low-income minority residents living in
   New York City public housing. ResultsAmong residents reporting a prior
   SARS CoV-2 test, main reasons for testing were to prepare for a medical
   procedure or because of a high-risk exposure. Barriers to testing
   included fear of discomfort from the nasal swab, fear of exposure to
   COVID-19 while traveling to get tested, concerns about the consequences
   of testing positive and the belief that testing was not necessary.
   Residents reported a mistrust of information sources and the health care
   system in general; they depended more on ``word of mouth{''} for
   information. The major barrier to vaccination was lack of trust in
   vaccine safety. Residents endorsed more convenient testing, onsite
   testing at residential buildings, and home self-test kits. Residents
   also emphasized the need for language-concordant information sharing and
   for information to come from ``people who look like {[}them] and come
   from the same background as {[}them]{''}. ConclusionsBarriers to SARS
   CoV-2 testing and vaccination centered on themes of a lack of accurate
   information, fear, mistrust, safety, and convenience. Resident-endorsed
   strategies to increase testing include making testing easier to access
   either through home or onsite testing locations. Education and
   information sharing by trusted members of the community are important
   tools to combat misinformation and build trust.},

Title = {Skepticism and defiance: Assessing credibility and representations of
   science},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Since the 1970s, there has been a growing interest in how individuals
   appropriate scientific knowledge, which has recently been reinforced by
   societal issues such as vaccine releases and skepticism about global
   warming. Faced with the health and social consequences of the mistrust
   of scientific knowledge, there is an urgent need for tools to measure
   the acceptance or rejection of scientific knowledge, while at the same
   time gaining a more detailed understanding of the processes involved.
   This is the purpose of this article. Thus, we conducted 4 empirical
   studies to provide a validation of the Credibility of Science Scale from
   the perspective of a French population, which aims to assess the
   credibility that individuals attribute to science and to empirically
   evaluate the link that may exist between the different levels of
   credibility attributed to science and the social representations of
   science. Studies 1a and 1b demonstrated good structural validity, the
   good fidelity (homogeneity and temporal stability), and the good
   criterion validity of the French version of the scale. In Study 2, we
   observed the same psychometric qualities of the French version of the
   scale. We also noted a structuring of the social representation of
   science based on age (Factor 1) and on the credibility attributed to
   science (Factor 2). Our results also raise the question of possible
   means of intervention to promote a better perception of science.},

Title = {Analytic atheism: Valuing epistemic rationality strengthens the
   association between analytic thinking and religious disbelief},
Journal = {PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {179},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Analytic thinking has been put forth as one of the processes through
   which people may become atheists. According to this view, people who are
   more (vs. less) analytically inclined should be more likely to reject
   the existence of deities because they rely less on the various intuitive
   cognitive processes that support supernatural beliefs. Consistent with
   this ``analytic atheism{''} hypothesis, studies have found a negative
   association between analytic thinking and religious belief. In the
   present article we expand on this literature and argue that analytic
   thinking should be more strongly associated with religious disbelief
   when coupled with motivation to be epistemically rational. Consistent
   with this hypothesis, we show that the association between analytic
   thinking and weaker religious faith (Study 1), as well as between
   analytic thinking and disbelief (vs. belief) in God, and related
   supernatural phenomena (Study 2-3) is stronger among people who ascribe
   more (vs. less) value to epistemic rationality.},

Abstract = {Based on a taxonomy of collective fears, the objective of the study (N =
   1,144) was to analyse how the original reasons attributed to an object
   of fear play a role in collective angst and to study how these
   attributions are linked to differentiated social representations of the
   object. The results show that the underlying reasons (human vs.
   non-human; intentional vs. unintentional) organize the
   socio-representational field of the coronavirus. Moreover, the fact of
   considering the viral epidemic as reversible (vs. irreversible) also
   plays a role in the socio-representational universe of individuals.
   Finally, we observe that the attribution of a human origin to the virus
   is linked to greater collective angst than an attribution to a natural
   origin. These first results show that it is important to focus on the
   attribution of the origin of objects of fear in order to understand its
   consequences in terms of social representations and collective angst.},

Journal = {MEDIA WAR AND CONFLICT},

Abstract = {Modern military training exercises often include an information warfare
   component. Combat manoeuvres and weapon tests may be combined with
   large-scale information operations, including attempts at mass deception
   and cultivation of fear via strategic uses of narratives in media. The
   ways in which fear is constructed in strategic narratives deserve more
   detailed discursive analysis. In this article, the authors use the
   largest recent Russian war games on NATO's eastern borders, the `Zapad
   2017' military exercise, as an example to show how to interpret fear
   narratives. They identify and analyse three strategic narratives that
   were formulated by Russian official spokespeople in relation to the
   exercise and uncover some of their underlying meaning-making tendencies:
   the logic of antithesis, affirmation through negation and the rhetoric
   of moral victimhood. Their analysis sheds new light on the uses of fear
   discourses that are more sophisticated and indirect than straightforward
   threats or (rhetorical) demonstrations of power to inflict damage.},

Abstract = {We present experimental evidence on the effectiveness of corporate
   leniency programs. Different from other leniency experiments, ours
   allows subjects to have free-form communication. We do not find much of
   an effect of leniency programs. Leniency does not deter cartels. It only
   delays them. Free-form communication allows subjects to build trust and
   resolve conflicts. Reporting and defection rates are low, especially
   when compared to experiments with restricted communication. Indeed,
   communication is so effective that, with leniency in place, prices are
   not affected if cartels are fined and cease to exist.},

Title = {The effects of group composition in a strategic environment: Evidence
   from a field experiment},
Journal = {EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW},

Volume = {90},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {67-85},

Abstract = {Recent theoretical and empirical studies have explored the effect of
   group membership and identity on individual decision-making. This line
   of research highlights that economic models focusing on the individual
   as the sole entity in the decision-making environment potentially miss
   critical features. This study takes this literature in a new direction
   by overlaying a field experiment onto a setting where groups have arisen
   naturally. Our experimental laboratory is large open air markets, where
   we are able to examine the effects of group membership on seller's
   collusive behavior as measured by prices and surplus allocations. This
   permits us to explore strategic implications of group composition.
   Empirical results illustrate the importance of group composition on
   pricing decisions, and show that deviations from Nash equilibrium are
   crucially related to group membership. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {We analyze 15 German cartels, focusing on the personal characteristics
   of the individual participants, the methods and frequency of
   communication as well as the internal organizational structures within
   the cartels and their eventual breakup. Our results indicate that cartel
   members are highly homogeneous and often rely on existing networks
   within the industry, such as trade associations. Most impressively, only
   two of the 158 individuals involved in these 15 cartels were female,
   suggesting that gender plays a role for cartel formation. We further
   identify various forms of communication and divisions of
   responsibilities and show that leniency programs are a powerful tool in
   breaking up cartels. Based on these results we discuss implications for
   competition policy and further research.},

Abstract = {Various social epistemologists employ what seem to be rather distinct
   notions of group rationality. In this essay, I offer an account of group
   rationality that is able to unify the dominant notions present in the
   literature under a single framework. I argue that if we employ a
   teleological account of epistemic rationality, and then allow that there
   are many different epistemic goals that are worth pursuing for various
   groups and individuals, we can then see how those seemingly divergent
   understandings of group rationality are all intimately related. I close
   by showing how the view has the additional benefit of allowing us to
   generate practical, normative suggestions for groups in the real world.},

Abstract = {Perceived discrimination and medical mistrust are contributors to HIV
   inequities. The current study examined whether medical mistrust mediated
   the associations between perceived discrimination and adherence to
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) as well as care engagement in a sample of
   304 Black adults living with HIV. Perceived discrimination and medical
   mistrust were measured using validated scales; ART adherence was
   electronically monitored for a month; care engagement was determined by
   medical record data. Results support significant total indirect effects
   from perceived discrimination (due to HIV-serostatus, race, sexual
   orientation) to ART adherence through three types of medical mistrust
   (towards healthcare organizations, one's physician, and HIV-specific
   mistrust). The total indirect effects were also significant for care
   engagement and were largely driven by mistrust towards one's own
   physician. Findings suggest interventions at the provider or healthcare
   organization levels should address medical mistrust to improve the
   health and well-being of Black Americans living with HIV.},

Abstract = {Strategic decision-making in the volatile and uncertain art market is
   not only instigated by rational interpretation of the external
   environment, but also by expert-based intuition. This paper investigates
   organisational failure at Phillips auctioneers between 1999 and 2002, a
   period in which it was owned by the multinational luxury goods
   conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH). To analyse this case,
   we develop a conceptual framework for strategic sensemaking in art
   organisations that includes the processes of scanning, interpreting,
   strategising, acting and adjusting, which take place in non-linear and
   recursive patterns in supporting continuous loops of improvement. Our
   analysis identifies the merits of intuitive decision-making when
   realising a novel artistic and entrepreneurial vision which established
   Phillips as a boutique auction house. However, it also highlights the
   limitations of emotional and opportunistic decision-making which could
   lead to blinded management if any of the processes of strategic
   sensemaking is ignored.},

Title = {\#Scamdemic, \#Plandemic, or \#Scaredemic: What Parler Social Media
   Platform Tells Us about COVID-19 Vaccine},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study aims to understand public discussions regarding COVID-19
   vaccine on Parler, a newer social media platform that recently gained in
   popularity. Through analyzing a random sample (n = 400) of Parler posts
   using the hashtags \#COVID19Vaccine and \#NoCovidVaccine, we use the
   concept of echo chambers to understand users' discussions through a text
   analytics approach. Thematic analysis reveals five key themes: reasons
   to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine (40\%), side effects of the COVID-19
   vaccine (28\%), population control through the COVID-19 vaccine (23\%),
   children getting vaccinated without parental consent (5\%), and
   comparison of other health issues with COVID-19 (2\%). Textual analysis
   shows that the most frequently used words in the corpus were:
   nocovidvaccine (348); vaccine (264); covid (184); covid19 (157); and
   vaccines (128). These findings suggest that users adopted different
   terms and hashtags to express their beliefs regarding the COVID-19
   vaccine. Further, findings revealed that users used certain hashtags
   such as ``echo{''} to encourage like-minded people to reinforce their
   existing beliefs on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and vaccine acceptance.
   These findings have implications for public health communication in
   attempts to correct false narratives on social media platforms. Through
   widely sharing the scientific findings of COVID-19 vaccine-related
   studies can help individuals understand the COVID-19 vaccines efficacy
   accurately.},

Abstract = {In recent years, analysts began to extensively draw on social network
   analysis to analyze dark networks (i.e., covert and illegal networks).
   In this article, we draw on network methods to explore the effect of tie
   strength on two ``dark networks{''} found in the Harry Potter
   novels-Dumbledore's Army and Voldemort's Death Eaters. We are not the
   first to draw on social network analysis to analyze a narrative. Network
   approaches are increasingly being used to analyze narratives and other
   texts. They can help identify key actors and events, highlight semantic
   structures, and uncover underlying meanings and mental models. Our
   analysis finds that several secondary characters play roles as
   important, or almost as important, as Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.
   Moreover, our comparison of the topographical structure of the two
   networks suggests that if the fictional world of Harry Potter remotely
   mirrors reality, Dumbledore's Army is built to withstand stress and
   uncertainty, while the Death Eaters is not, suggesting that J. K.
   Rowling has an intuitive understanding of a key difference between
   networks built on trust and those built on fear. The former live to
   fight another day; the latter do not.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that identity fusion can motivate violent
   self-sacrifice when the group is threatened. In this study we conducted
   an ethnographic content analysis of fifteen manifestos - expressing
   varied levels of extremism - to examine whether fusion and other
   relevant variables can be reliably identified and if the predictions of
   the fusion-plus-threat model are supported. Our findings indicate that
   linguistic proxies for identity fusion combined with mediating and
   moderating variables such as existential threat narratives,
   violence-condoning group norms and dehumanizing vocabulary, can be
   reliably identified and are more prevalent in the documents of would-be
   terrorists. This method may contribute to predicting the likelihood that
   individuals will engage in acts of violent extremism.},

Abstract = {As a result of massive scale-up efforts in developing countries,
   millions of people living with HIV are now receiving antiretroviral
   therapy (ART). However, countries have been uneven in their scale-up
   efforts with ART coverage rates exceeding expectations in some places
   and lagging behind expectation in others. This paper develops a model
   that explains ART scale-up as a function of the responsiveness of
   political parties to their primary constituents. Specifically, the paper
   argues that, faced with a perilous ``threat to the nation', countries
   responded in one of two ways, both of which were designed to appeal to
   their primary constituents - either adopting a ``Geneva Consensus'
   response, or depicting the epidemic as a Western disease and adopting a
   ``pan-African' response. The article tests this theory using
   Afrobarometer data for eleven countries. The paper finds that HIV/AIDS
   is generally a non-partisan issue in most countries. However, the
   analysis does uncover some differences in partisan support for HIV/AIDS
   responses in both countries that have adopted Geneva Consensus and
   pan-African responses, though not in the direction hypothesised. The
   lack of congruence in policy preferences between the public and their
   governments suggests a democratic deficit in that these governments have
   acted independently of the preferences of core constituents.},

Title = {Rapid qualitative analysis approach to stakeholder and client interviews

Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe severity of the HIV epidemic in the United States' rural
   South highlights geographic, socioeconomic, and racial disparities that
   disproportionately affect poor Black Americans. Approximately 16\% of
   Alabamians living with HIV remain undiagnosed and just 37\% of rural
   Alabamians have ever been tested for HIV.MethodsWe conducted in-depth
   interviews with 22 key stakeholders involved in HIV prevention, testing,
   treatment, or community health initiatives, and 10 adults living in
   rural communities across Alabama to explore HIV testing challenges and
   opportunities. We utilized a rapid qualitative analysis approach and
   engaged community partners for feedback and discussion. This analysis
   will inform the implementation of a mobile HIV testing service in rural
   Alabama.ResultsThe following themes were identified: (1) Cultural norms,
   racism, poverty, and rurality impair access to healthcare. (2) Lack of
   sex education, low knowledge of HIV and perception of risk reinforce
   stigmas. (3) Messaging about ``Undetectable = Untransmissible{''} (U =
   U) is not well understood in communities. (4) Community involvement may
   promote communication and trust between communities and testing
   advocates. (5) Novel testing strategies are acceptable and may diminish
   barriers.ConclusionsWorking with community ``gatekeepers{''} may be a
   key strategy to understand and promote acceptability of interventions
   new to rural Alabama and ameliorate stigma within communities. The
   implementation of new HIV testing strategies requires building and
   maintaining relationships with advocates, especially faith-based
   leaders, who engage people across many demographics.},

Abstract = {Previous studies on palliative care have assessed the phenomenon of
   Information Concealment (IC), confirmed its relevance and emphasised the
   need to have a scale for its assessment. The aim of this study was to
   design and validate such an instrument. The sample comprised 150
   palliative caregivers (23 men and 127 women). The dimensionality of the
   items of the Information Concealment Scale for Caregivers (ECOI) was
   assessed using Exploratory Factor Analysis and an optimal implementation
   of parallel analysis. Reliability and criterion validity were analysed
   using sample data. The ECOI comprises three factors: Concealment or
   dissimulation about the disease, misrepresentation of the real situation
   and control of the information. The scale has excellent reliability and
   shows criterion validity. Therefore, the ECOI is a reliable and valid
   instrument to objectively measure IC among Spanish caregivers in
   palliative care settings.},

Abstract = {This article argues that accounts of the Russian media system that tend
   to view the time from Vladimir Putin's rise to power in 2000 as a single
   homogenous period do not capture major qualitative shifts in
   state-controlled media coverage. By analyzing the output of Russia's two
   main television channels during Putin's third presidential term, we
   identify a range of distinctly new features that amount to a new media
   strategy. This involves a significant increase in the coverage of
   political issues through the replacement of infotainment with what we
   term agitainmentan ideologically inflected content that, through
   adapting global media formats to local needs, attempts to appeal to less
   engaged and even sceptical viewers. Despite the tightening of political
   control over the media following the annexation of Crimea, the new
   strategy paradoxically has strengthened the constitutive role played by
   the state-controlled broadcasters in the articulation of official
   discourse.},

Abstract = {Despite winning the presidency in 2016, Donald Trump alleged ``millions
   of illegal votes{''} and other election fraud. He continued using this
   rhetoric throughout his tenure as president and ultimately suggested
   that if he did not win reelection in 2020, it would be because it
   somehow was stolen from him. Through an original survey experiment, this
   article explores how such allegations of fraud influence the public's
   attitudes toward the conduct of elections, election outcomes,
   representation, and democracy as a whole. In doing so, we found that
   respondents expressed significantly and substantively more negative
   attitudes toward elections and democracy after being exposed to claims
   of fraud (even without evidence). Additionally, Republican identifiers
   were more likely than Democrats or Independents to doubt that their vote
   was counted fairly. These results bear important implications for our
   current understanding of politics in the United States.},

Abstract = {Ever since Brandenburg v. Ohio, departures from content neutrality under
   the First Amendment have received strict scrutiny. However, in Holder v.
   Humanitarian Law Project ({''}HLP{''}), the Supreme Court decided that
   the perils of content regulation were less pressing than was the need to
   curb the human capital of groups, such as Ham as, designated as foreign
   terrorist organizations ({''}DFTOs{''}). As a result, the Court upheld a
   statute that bars ``material support{''} of terrorist organizations,
   ruling that the statute bars speech coordinated with DFTOs, including
   training in negotiation or the use of international law. Some
   commentators have labeled HLP as heralding a new McCarthyism. This
   Article argues that critics who condemn HLP as the reincarnation of Cold
   War content regulation overlook the tailored quality of the decision's
   hybrid scrutiny model, its roots in the Framers' concerns about foreign
   influence, and its surprising parallels with constitutional
   justifications for professional regulation.
   HLP is not the marked departure that critics claim. Just as professional
   regulation limits lawyers' use of pretrial publicity, HLP reduced the
   impact of asymmetries in information that terrorist groups exploit. To
   constrain government, HLP's framework of hybrid scrutiny also provides a
   safe harbor for the independent expression of ideas, and for scholars,
   journalists, human rights monitors, and attorneys.
   Nevertheless, HLP's critics are right that the Court's decision is
   flawed. Chief Justice Roberts's opinion invited confusion about the
   First Amendment status of lending ``legitimacy{''} to violence, which
   could quickly drain the safe harbor that the Court created for
   independent advocacy. The opinion also made a studied show of deference
   to official sources, disdaining independent accounts of terrorist
   groups' penchant for defection. Only the next case will tell if these
   flaws were minor missteps in a balanced decision or signs of a more
   severe conflict with First Amendment values.},

Title = {COVID-19 Vaccine Intentions and Mistrust in a National Sample of Black
   Americans},

Abstract = {Background: National data indicate low intentions for COVID-19
   vaccination among a substantial minority of Black Americans, and
   disproportionately lower vaccination rates among Black Americans than
   White Americans. Methods: A total of 207 of the 318 Black participants
   (65\%) in the RAND American Life Panel, a nationally representative
   internet panel, were surveyed about COVID-19 vaccine intentions in
   November-December 2020. Participants' census tracts were geocoded using
   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability
   Index. Results: Overall, 35\% agreed or strongly agreed that they would
   not get a COVID-19 vaccine, 40\% agreed or strongly agreed that they
   would get vaccinated, and 25\% reported ``don't know.{''} Significant
   multivariable predictors of not wanting to get vaccinated included high
   mistrust of the vaccine itself (e.g., concerns about harm and side
   effects), OR (95\% CI ) = 2.2 (1.2-3.9), p = .007, and weak subjective
   norms for vaccination in one's close social network, OR (95\% CI ) = 0.6
   (0.4-0.7), p < .001. Residence in an area of higher socioeconomic
   vulnerability was a marginally significant predictor, OR (95\% CI ) =
   3.1 (0.9-11.0), p = .08. Conclusions: High mistrust around COVID-19
   vaccines may lower vaccine confidence. Social network members' attitudes
   can be influential in encouraging vaccination. Public health
   communications could use transparent and clear messaging on safety and
   efficacy, and acknowledge historical and ongoing discrimination and
   racism as understandable reasons for low confidence in COVID-19
   vaccines. Future research is needed to consider vaccine access
   challenges in tandem with mistrust as contributing to low vaccination
   rates across health conditions.},

Title = {LEVEL OF ACCEPTANCE OF EPISTEMICALLY UNWARRANTED BELIEFS IN PRE-SERVICE
   PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS: INFLUENCE OF COGNITIVE STYLE, ACADEMIC LEVEL
   AND GENDER},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BALTIC SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {398-407},
Abstract = {One of the main objectives of scientific literacy is the development of
   rational skills and critical thinking in citizens. This is a central
   goal for teachers. However, beliefs that lack rational foundation and
   supporting evidence, named ``epistemically unwarranted beliefs{''}
   (EUB), spread rapidly among the population. If teachers had some of
   these EUB, their work could be compromised. The aim of this research was
   to determine the level of acceptance of different EUB in Spanish
   pre-service primary school teachers and to analyze the influence of
   their cognitive style, gender, and academic level. Two hundred and fifty
   undergraduate students of Bachelor's Degree in Primary Education
   participated in this study. Two questionnaires were used to collect
   data. ANOVA, ANCOVA, correlations, and linear regression analysis were
   used to quantify that influence. Results showed high levels of
   acceptance of some EUB in future teachers, with significant influences
   of gender and academic level, and a mediating role of cognitive styles.
   Experiential and rational cognitive styles, and academic level were
   significant predictors of EUB, being experiential thinking the most
   powerful one. Thus, pre-service teacher education should have an
   epistemological vigilance on future teachers' scientific literacy and
   increase the presence of rational style among teachers.},

Abstract = {Recent research has identified anti-vaccination propaganda in the
   so-called Russian Troll Tweets strongly associated with the 2016 US
   Presidential election. This study builds on this: hypothesising that if
   vaccination content was found in the sample, the Russia Tweets would be
   likely to contain other science content, and perhaps, similar pseudo or
   anti-science messages. As well as vaccination, climate change,
   genetically modified organisms, Ebola, flat Earth beliefs (flat
   Earthism) and Zika were found in the Russia tweets. Genetically modified
   organisms and flat Earthism appear to have been camouflage content -
   tweeted at similar rates to other Twitter users - while climate change,
   Ebola, Zika and vaccination appear to have been emphasised beyond the
   background rate for strategic disinformation purposes.},

Abstract = {It is well known that communication often serves as a facilitator for
   cooperation in static games. Yet, communication can serve entirely
   different purposes in dynamic settings as communication during the game
   may work as a means for renegotiation, potentially undermining the
   credibility of cooperative strategies. To explore this issue, this paper
   experimentally investigates cooperation and non-binding communication in
   a two-stage game. More specifically, two treatments are considered: one
   with only pre-play communication and one where subjects can also
   communicate intra-play between the stages of the game. The results
   highlight a nontrivial difference concerning the effects of pre-play
   communication between the two treatments. Sending or receiving pre-play
   messages has a positive and significant effect on cooperation if there
   is no possibility of intra-play communication. However, this effect is
   significantly reduced when when intra-play communication is allowed. The
   results suggest that the credibility of pre-play messages may depend
   crucially on future communication opportunities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Advances in analytical methodologies and an avalanche of digitized data
   have opened new avenues for (digital) journalism research-and with it,
   new challenges. One of these challenges concerns the sampling and
   evaluation of data using (non-validated) search terms in combination
   with automated content analyses. This challenge has largely been
   neglected by research, which is surprising, considering that noise
   slipping in during the process of data collection can generate great
   methodological concerns. To address this gap, we first offer a
   systematic interdisciplinary literature review, revealing that the
   validation of search terms is far from acknowledged as a required
   standard procedure, both in and beyond journalism research. Second, we
   assess the consequences of validating search terms, using a multi-step
   approach and investigating common research topics from the field of
   (digital) journalism research. Our findings show that careless
   application of non-validated search terms has its pitfalls: while
   scattershot search terms can make sense in initial data exploration,
   final inferences based on insufficiently validated search terms are at
   higher risk of being obscured by noise. Consequently, we provide a
   step-by-step recommendation for developing and validating search terms.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {This study explores Facebook-based state media accounts from various
   geopolitical players and focuses on three practices-content volume,
   intermedia agenda-setting/following, and coordinated sharing through
   networks of Facebook pages, groups, and verified public profiles.
   Findings suggest that Russian and Chinese state media are more active in
   content production than their global peers, yet with limited reach.
   Chinese state media stand out as both agenda-setters and followers: They
   inject distinct agendas into the global news flows while closely
   following agendas first covered by other global outlets. State media
   from all types of geopolitical players engage in inauthentic coordinated
   sharing, but with notable differences in the ideological composition of
   the mobilized Facebook networks: The Chinese coordinated-sharing network
   is homegrown and limited; the Russian network consists of right-leaning
   and counter-mainstream political groups worldwide, while the
   coordinated-sharing networks mobilized by the state media in the Middle
   East, Venezuela, and Western liberal democracies are left-leaning and
   human-rights focused.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study empirically investigates how the COVID-infodemic
   manifests differently in different languages and in different countries.
   This paper focuses on the topical and temporal features of
   misinformation related to COVID-19 in five countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - COVID-related misinformation was retrieved
   from 4,487 fact-checked articles. A novel approach to conducting
   cross-lingual topic extraction was applied. The rectr algorithm,
   empowered by aligned word-embedding, was utilised. To examine how the
   COVID-infodemic interplays with the pandemic, a time series analysis was
   used to construct and compare their temporal development.
   Findings - The cross-lingual topic model findings reveal the topical
   characteristics of each country. On an aggregated level, health
   misinformation represents only a small portion of the COVID-infodemic.
   The time series results indicate that, for most countries, the infodemic
   curve fluctuates with the epidemic curve. In this study, this form of
   infodemic is referred to as ``point-source infodemic{''}. The second
   type of infodemic is continuous infodemic, which is seen in India and
   the United States (US). In those two countries, the infodemic is
   predominantly caused by political misinformation; its temporal
   distribution appears to be largely unrelated to the epidemic
   development.
   Originality/value - Despite the growing attention given to
   misinformation research, existing scholarship is dominated by
   single-country or mono-lingual research. This study takes a
   cross-national and cross-lingual comparative approach to investigate the
   problem of online misinformation. This paper demonstrates how the
   technological barrier of cross-lingual topic analysis can be overcome
   with aligned word-embedding algorithms.},

Abstract = {The point of game tree search is to insulate oneself from errors in the
   evaluation function. The standard approach is to grow a full width tree
   as deep as time allows, and then value the tree as if the leaf
   evaluations were exact. The alpha-beta algorithm implements this with
   great computational efficiency. This approach has been effective in many
   games. Our approach is to form a Bayesian model of our uncertainty. We
   adopt an evaluation function that returns a probability distribution
   estimating the probability of various errors in valuing each position.
   These estimates are obtained by training from data. We thus use
   additional information at each leaf not available to the standard
   approach. We utilize this information in three ways: to evaluate which
   move is best after we are done expanding, to allocate additional
   thinking time to moves where additional time is most relevant to game
   outcome, and, perhaps most importantly, to expand the tree along the
   most relevant lines. Our measure of the relevance of expanding a given
   leaf provably approximates a measure of the impact of expanding the leaf
   on expected payoff; including the impact of the outcome of the leaf
   expansion on later expansion decisions. Our algorithms run (under
   reasonable assumptions) in time linear in the size of the final tree and
   hence except for a small constant factor, are as time efficient as
   alpha-beta. Our algorithm focuses on relevant lines, on which it can in
   principle grow a tree several times as deep as alpha-beta in a given
   amount of time. We have tested our approach on a variety of games,
   including Othello, Kalah, Warri, and others. Our probability
   independence approximations are seen to be significantly violated, but
   nonetheless our tree valuation scheme was found to play significantly
   better than minimax or the Probability Product rule when both
   competitors search the same tree. Our full search algorithm was found to
   outplay a highly ranked, directly comparable alpha-beta Othello program
   even when the alpha-beta program was given sizeable time odds, and also
   performed well against the three top Othello programs on the Internet

Abstract = {In an effort to stave off racial and geographic prejudices, The World
   Health Organization (WHO) has advised against naming pathogens for
   geographic regions. Despite this, some media reports, and prominent
   politicians, have persisted in calling the coronavirus the ``Chinese
   Virus,{''} or some variant thereof. In this pre-registered online
   experiment (N = 614), we examined the effect media frames and individual
   factors (i.e., political affiliation and party) had on perceptions of
   COVID-19, prejudice against Chinese- and Asian-Americans, and
   attributing blame to China for the coronavirus. We found that articles
   that labeled the coronavirus the ``Chinese Virus{''} (versus the
   ``COVID-19 Virus{''}) were perceived less favorably by Democrats and
   liberals, in comparison to Republicans and conservatives, who were also
   more likely to express greater racial prejudice against Chinese- and
   Asian-Americans and to blame China for the pandemic. Findings from this
   study suggest that amongst a host of other variables, media framing has
   an effect on the public's attitudes and feelings of blame for the
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {Although bullshit is common in everyday life and has attracted attention
   from philosophers, its reception (critical or ingenuous) has not, to our
   knowledge, been subject to empirical investigation. Here we focus on
   pseudo-profound bullshit, which consists of seemingly impressive
   assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually
   vacuous. We presented participants with bullshit statements consisting
   of buzzwords randomly organized into statements with syntactic structure
   but no discernible meaning (e.g., ``Wholeness quiets infinite
   phenomena{''}). Across multiple studies, the propensity to judge
   bullshit statements as profound was associated with a variety of
   conceptually relevant variables (e.g., intuitive cognitive style,
   supernatural belief). Parallel associations were less evident among
   profundity judgments for more conventionally profound (e.g., ``A wet
   person does not fear the rain{''}) or mundane (e.g., ``Newborn babies
   require constant attention{''}) statements. These results support the
   idea that some people are more receptive to this type of bullshit and
   that detecting it is not merely a matter of indiscriminate skepticism
   but rather a discernment of deceptive vagueness in otherwise impressive
   sounding claims. Our results also suggest that a bias toward accepting
   statements as true may be an important component of pseudo-profound
   bullshit receptivity.},

Title = {Predictors of Retention in HIV Care Among a National Cohort of US
   Veterans},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Background: Poor retention in HIV care leads to poor survival. The
   predictors of poor retention in HIV care are not well understood,
   especially from US nationwide data-sets. We determined the predictors of
   poor retention in HIV care among a group of US veterans and examined
   whether poor retention was confounded by other predictors of survival.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2,619 male US
   veterans who started antiretroviral therapy after January 1, 1998. Poor
   retention in HIV care was defined as having had at least 1 quarter-year
   without any primary care visit in the year after starting antiretroviral
   therapy. Survival was assessed through 2002. Logistic regression and Cox
   models were constructed. Results: Thirty-six percent of patients had
   poor retention in care. In multivariable analysis, younger age, Black
   race/ethnicity, CD4 cell count >350 x 10(6)/L, hepatitis C infection,
   and illicit drug use were predictive of poor retention in care. Having a
   chronic medical comorbidity and being identified as a man having sex
   with men (MSM) were associated with improved retention in care. In
   multivariable survival analyses, poor retention in care was not a
   confounder or moderator for other variables that predicted survival.
   Conclusions: Retention in HIV care is an independent predictor of
   survival. As routine HIV screening increases, more people with the
   characteristics predictive of poor retention in care will be identified.
   Interventions to improve retention in care are needed.},

Abstract = {Awareness of the potential psychological significance of false news
   increased during the coronavirus pandemic, however, its impact on
   psychopathology and individual differences remains unclear.
   Acknowledging this, the authors investigated the psychological and
   psychopathological profiles that characterize fake news consumption. A
   total of 1452 volunteers from the general population with no previous
   psychiatric history participated. They responded to clinical
   psychopathology assessment tests. Respondents solved a fake news
   screening test, which allowed them to be allocated to a
   quasi-experimental condition: group 1 (non-fake news consumers) or group
   2 (fake news consumers). Mean comparison, Bayesian inference, and
   multiple regression analyses were applied. Participants with a
   schizotypal, paranoid, and histrionic personality were ineffective at
   detecting fake news. They were also more vulnerable to suffer its
   negative effects. Specifically, they displayed higher levels of anxiety
   and committed more cognitive biases based on suggestibility and the
   Barnum Effect. No significant effects on psy-chotic symptomatology or
   affective mood states were observed. Corresponding to these outcomes,
   two clinical and therapeutic recommendations related to the reduction of
   the Barnum Effect and the reinterpretation of digital media
   sensationalism were made. The impact of fake news and possible ways of
   prevention are discussed.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article was to provide a new conceptual approach to the
   analysis of terrorism in Security studies. A new approach was presented
   in which the starting point of the analysis is the position of the
   victim, which distinguishes this work from the majority of authors that
   start their research from the position of the perpetrator of the crime.
   At the same time, the originality of this article is reflected in one
   innovative approach to the classification of terrorism. The basic
   classification was focused on internal and external terrorism with
   different types and subtypes. Key attention in this article was given to
   the link between terrorism and political violence. The political message
   sent by violence is an essential element of the crime of terrorism. To
   carry out any terrorist attack, all elements must be met. In addition to
   the operational possibility of carrying out a terrorist attack, the most
   important component is the motivation that in this case comes from the
   radical ideology of Islamists. The methods that were used in this
   research are literature review, methods of analysis and synthesis, and
   comparative methods.},

Abstract = {Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are disproportionately affected
   by HIV infection in the USA. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a proven
   efficacious biomedical prevention strategy with the potential to alter
   significantly the course of the epidemic in this population. However,
   the social stigma attached to PrEP and those who use it may act as a
   barrier to the uptake and continuation of PrEP among high-risk BMSM.
   In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 26
   BMSM PrEP users to explore their experiences of stigma related to their
   PrEP use. BMSM reported multiple experiences or manifestations of
   PrEP-related stigma, which included (1) perception that PrEP users
   engage in elevated sexual risk behaviors; (2) conflicts in relationships
   attributed to PrEP; (3) experiences of discomfort or judgment from
   medical providers; (4) assumption that PrEP users are HIV-positive; and
   (5) gay stigma in families limiting PrEP disclosure. The experiences of
   stigma typically occur within the context of PrEP disclosure and have
   significant personal and social consequences for PrEP users. Efforts to
   address PrEP and other social-stigmas within the Black community may
   help facilitate PrEP uptake and continuation with BMSM.},

Abstract = {This study examines the extent to which belief in extrasensory
   perception (ESP), psychokinesis (PK) or life after death (LAD), plus
   need for cognition (NFC) and faith in intuition (FI), predict the
   generation of confirmatory conjunction errors. An opportunity sample (n
   = 261) completed sixteen conjunction problems manipulated across a 2
   event type (paranormal vs. non-paranormal) x 2 outcome type
   (confirmatory vs. disconfirmatory) within subjects design. Three
   Generalised Linear Mixed Models - one per paranormal belief type - were
   performed. With respondent gender and age controlled for, ESP, PK and
   LAD beliefs were all associated with the making (vs. non-making) of
   conjunction errors both generally and specifically for confirmatory
   conjunctive outcomes. Event type had no impact. Individuals high in NFC
   were less likely to commit the fallacy. The role thinking style plays in
   shaping paranormal believers' susceptibility to confirmatory conjunction
   biases is discussed. Methodological issues and future research ideas are
   also considered.},

Abstract = {This article examines the legal issues concerning the establishment of
   responsibility for an internationally wrongful act in the context of
   transboundary disinformation. In light of the unprecedented surge of
   potentially dangerous health disinformation throughout the COVID-19
   pandemic, there is growing consensus among academics and states that
   influence campaigns that utilize false or misleading information may
   qualify as a violation of international law, amounting to a prohibited
   coercive intervention, a breach of the target state's territorial
   inviolability or independence of state powers or, in extreme cases, even
   a use of force. However, the aspects of attributing the dissemination of
   disinformation to a state and of demonstrating a causal nexus between
   disinformation and effect that are necessary for international
   responsibility to arise have not been sufficiently addressed in the
   literature. This article analyses the challenges that contemporary forms
   of digital disinformation create for proving attribution pursuant to the
   customary rules of state responsibility as well as the issue of
   causation. In doing so, it investigates the content of the primary rules
   for clues pertaining to the necessary causal nexus and assesses
   different standards of causation employed in international and domestic
   law.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates that a robust tacit collusion evolves quickly
   in a ``collusion incubator{''} environment but is destroyed by the
   simultaneous descending price auction. Theories of collusion-producing
   behavior, along with the detail of the states on which strategies are
   conditioned, lead to a deeper understanding of how tacit collusion
   evolves and its necessary conditions. These theories explain how the
   descending price auction destroys the collusion. The experiments proceed
   by conducting simultaneous ascending price auctions in the collusion
   incubator. Then, once the tacit collusion developed, changing to the
   descending auction. The change moved prices from collusive levels to
   near-competitive levels. (JEL C71, C92, D43, D44).},

Abstract = {The epidemiology and demographics of human immunodeficiency
   virus/acquired immunodcficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) have evolved over
   the last 25 years in the United States to include more women and
   minority populations, especially Latinos and African Americans. In
   addition, there has been a shift in HIV/AIDS cases from large
   northeastern and western metropolitan areas to persons living in rural
   areas and the south. The reasons for the changes and the shift are
   unclear, but major barriers to primary prevention strategies are most
   likely sociocultural. This article reviews some of the sociocultural
   barriers in HIV/AIDS prevention and presents a new approach or framework
   for addressing these barriers. The framework highlights Stigma, Fear,
   and Denial as barriers in interventions for HIV/AIDS targeted at African
   Americans living in rural Alabama. The framework uses a culturally
   competent, community-based approach. It is hoped that this framework
   could also be used as a model for addressing HIV/AIDS in other
   communities, as well as addressing other health disparities where
   stigma, fear, and denial may play a role, such as cancer, diabetes,
   heart disease, immunizations, and infant mortality.},

   discrimination},
Journal = {WOMEN \& HEALTH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-39},
Abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine perceived
   race-based discrimination in obtaining family planning or contraceptive
   services among African American women in the U.S.
   Methods: We conducted a 30-minute telephone survey with a random sample
   of 500 African Americans (aged 15-44), which included questions about
   race-based discrimination when obtaining family planning services. The
   present analyses were limited to the 326 women who completed interviews.
   Results: The majority (79\%) of women reported having seen a health care
   provider for family planning or birth control services. Of those, 67\%
   reported race-based discrimination when obtaining such services.Half of
   the women reported more general experiences of discrimination when
   obtaining family planning services (e.g., poorer service), and 52\%
   reported experiences that reflect stereotypes of African American women
   (e.g., doctor or nurse assumed they had multiple sexual partners). Most
   indicated that experiences of discrimination occurred infrequently.
   Generally, background characteristics were not significantly associated
   with perceived discrimination. However, in multivariate models, stronger
   Black identity, younger age, and lower income were associated with
   reports of discrimination.
   Conclusion: African American women may be vulnerable to prejudice within
   reproductive health care contexts, including family planning.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the development of an academic of colour between
   ethnographic fieldwork and becoming an academic. In terms of data
   collection, this study demonstrates the complexities and multiple
   positionalities ascribed and assumed within fieldwork which question the
   stability of the insider/outsider dichotomy. These positionalitics range
   from being a Muslim `brother' to being aligned with Government security.
   Being Muslim and male also allowed for entrance in areas of the field
   which were exclusively for Muslim males. While fieldwork presented
   certain complexities, being a person of colour and Muslim in academia
   presents many more. A number of studies have demonstrated the structural
   whiteness of academia and thus, dealing with this as an academic of
   colour require particular skills and actions. I share my experiences of
   navigating academia as a person of colour and question the role of
   whiteness within ethnographically oriented representative groups which
   are exclusively white and who represent an academic audience for
   ethnographic scholarship.},

Abstract = {What do lay people think about revised forecasts of future outcomes? A
   series of experiments show that when climate change forecasts are
   revised in an upward direction (e.g., a higher sea level rise is
   predicted in light of new information), the forecast is perceived as
   more certain in contrast to revisions in a downward direction. This
   association is bidirectional so that people also think a forecast that
   has become more certain (uncertain) indicates a stronger (weaker)
   outcome. Furthermore, when the timing of the outcome is revised, a
   predicted sooner occurrence (a stronger outcome) was judged to be more
   certain than a predicted delayed occurrence. Upward revisions may also
   lead to more positive impressions of the forecast and the forecaster,
   with clear implications for the communication of uncertainty, both for
   climate change and in other domains. Different theoretical explanations
   for the results are discussed.},

Abstract = {Trust is crucial to the public's compliance with policies and rules
   released by governments, particularly in times of the coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, it remains unclear whether
   and to what extent late adolescents' interpersonal and institutional
   trust fluctuated from the pre-COVID-19 pandemic to the lasting phase of
   the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study uses three-wave longitudinal
   data from the Youth Got Talent (YGT) project to address this gap (n =
   1,423; 43\% boys; M-age = 17.85, SD = 1.95). Latent basis growth curve
   models showed that interpersonal trust remained relatively stable over
   time. In contrast, institutional trust temporarily increased from
   pre-COVID-19 pandemic (Fall 2019) to the initial phase of the COVID-19
   pandemic (Spring 2020) and subsequently, decreased during the lasting
   phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (Fall 2020). These results enhance our
   understanding of trust among late adolescents and have implications for
   policies aiming to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Factors facilitating collusion may not successfully predict cartel
   occurrence: When a factor predicts that collusion (explicit and tacit)
   becomes easier, firms might be less inclined to set up a cartel simply
   because tacit coordination already tends to go in hand with
   supra-competitive profits. We illustrate this issue with laboratory
   data. We run n-firm Cournot experiments with written cheap-talk
   communication between players and we compare them to treatments without
   the possibility to talk. We conduct this comparison for two, four, and
   six firms. We find that two firms indeed find it easier to collude
   tacitly but that the number of firms does not significantly affect
   outcomes with communication. As a result, the payoff gain from
   communication increases with the number of firms, at a decreasing rate.},

Abstract = {Jean Baudrillard outlined a theory of value in his early writings that
   built on, but also criticized, Marxist concepts of use value and
   exchange value. In this paper, I use a close reading to delineate the
   diachronic transition of Baudrillard's writings toward anti-Marxism and
   (allegedly) postmodernism, with specific focus on his value theory, in
   order to understand his own reasons for abandoning his previous
   position. I then follow the marginal stream of scholars who are making
   use of the early Baudrillard. I find his value theory promising but
   still a mere sketch rather than an actual general theory. The paper
   concludes that Baudrillard's arguments for abandoning Marxism altogether
   are problematic and led him away from developing a more finished theory
   of value. This is unfortunate because it remains a project that may
   yield interesting insights even in contemporary social theory, not least
   in supporting reconciliation (e.g., between critical
   semiotics-influenced positions and Marxism).},

Abstract = {Do perceived political threats lead to religious exclusion? This study
   explores the political rationale of the exclusionary attitude towards
   non-Muslim minorities in Turkey. It relies on a qualitative content
   analysis of the discussions on the Armenian, Greek and Jewish
   foundations in the Turkish parliament in the 2000s. While doing so, the
   research brings together the academic literatures on the perception of
   religious minorities in Turkey with the group threat perspective. The
   findings show that the exclusionary statements about the non-Muslim
   minorities are often justified by suspecting them as potential plotters
   of the dismemberment of the country. The article concludes that to
   achieve an inclusive political culture in Turkey, it is imperative to
   understand the perceived national security threats. It also underlines
   that parliamentary debates constitute an ideal resource for research,
   which deserves greater attention.},

Title = {Tidal tales two: The effect of dark matter halos on tidal tail
   morphology and kinematics},

Abstract = {We examine the effect of different dark matter halo potentials on the
   morphology and kinematics of tidal tails in a merger model of NGC 7252.
   We find that models of merging galaxies with low halo masses of M-h
   similar to 4 - 8 Mdisk+bulge(Mdb) can fit the observed morphology and
   kinematics of the NGC 7252 tails, while galaxies with high-mass halos
   (M-h similar to 16 - 32 M-db) fail in this respect. In high-mass models,
   the deep potential only allows weakly bound disk material (stars or gas)
   at R greater than or similar to 5 disk scale lengths to be ejected in
   tidal tails that tend to fall back onto the parent galaxies before the
   final merger. Galaxies with massive, low-density halos are somewhat more
   successful at ejecting tidal debris during mergers, but they still have
   difficulties recreating the thin, gas-rich tails observed in NGC 7252.
   Our models suggest upper limits for the dark halo masses in the NGC 7252
   progenitor galaxies of roughly M-h less than or similar to 10 M-db. We
   note, however, that our calculations have focused on the rather
   idealized case of the isolated merging of galaxies with distinct dark
   matter halos; calculations that employ more realistic
   ({''}cosmological{''}) initial conditions are needed to fully explore
   the use of tidal tails in constraining dark matter in galaxies.},

Journal = {DATA \& KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {ABSTR A C T Fake news is a threat to society. A huge amount of fake news
   is posted every day on social networks which is read, believed and
   sometimes shared by a number of users. On the other hand, with the aim
   to raise awareness, some users share posts that debunk fake news by
   using information from fact-checking websites. In this paper, we are
   interested in exploring the role of various psycholinguistic
   characteristics in differentiating between users that tend to share fake
   news and users that tend to debunk them. Psycholinguistic
   characteristics represent the different linguistic information that can
   be used to profile users and can be extracted or inferred from users'
   posts. We present the CheckerOrSpreader model that uses a Convolution
   Neural Network (CNN) to differentiate between spreaders and checkers of
   fake news. The experimental results showed that CheckerOrSpreader is
   effective in classifying a user as a potential spreader or checker. Our
   analysis showed that checkers tend to use more positive language and a
   higher number of terms that show causality compared to spreaders who
   tend to use a higher amount of informal language, including slang and
   swear words.},

Abstract = {Secrecy is often studied as a social phenomenon in which certain
   information is concealed from a targeted audience out of fear of the
   repercussions, if this information were to fall into the wrong hands. It
   is therefore surprising that people are relatively willing to share
   their secrets with others. Traditionally, this behaviour has been
   explained on the bases of the assumption that people are naturally
   inclined to reveal their secrets. However, new evidence from the
   cognitive sciences and social psychology calls this assumption, and thus
   the theories of secrecy which rely on it, into question. In this article
   I present a re-interpretation of secrecy in light of this new evidence
   and evaluate what implications this holds for the study of secrecy in
   religion.},

Title = {Addressing HIV Misconceptions among Heterosexual Black Men and
   Communities in Ontario},
Journal = {HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background. Black males accounted for 19.7\% of all the new HIV
   diagnoses in Canada in 2020, yet Black people make up only 4.26\% of the
   population. Persistent misconceptions about modes of HIV transmission
   need to be addressed to reduce the relatively high HIV prevalence among
   Black men. We described the HIV misconceptions held by some HBM in
   Ontario. We also identified the social determinants that are protective
   versus risk factors for HIV misconceptions among heterosexual Black men
   (HBM) in Ontario with a view to building evidence-based strategies for
   strengthening HIV prevention and stigma reduction among HBM and their
   communities in Ontario. Methods. We report quantitative findings of the
   weSpeak study carried out among HBM in four cities (Ottawa, Toronto,
   London, and Windsor) in Ontario. Sample size was 866 and sub-samples
   were: Ottawa (n = 210), Toronto (n = 343), London (n = 157), and Windsor
   (n = 156). Data were collected with survey questionnaire. The outcome
   variable, HIV misconception score ranging from 1 to 18, was measured by
   the number of statements on the HIV Knowledge Questionnaire with
   incorrect answers. We included three categories of independent variables
   in the analysis based on a stepwise and forward model selection
   approach. The variable categories include (i) sociodemographic
   background; (ii) personalised psychosocial attributes (levels of HIV
   misconceptions, negative condom attitude, age at sexual debut, and
   resilience); and (iii) socially ascribed psychosocial experiences
   (everyday discrimination and pro-community attitudes). After preliminary
   univariate and bivariate analyses, we used a hierarchical linear
   regression model (HLM) to predict levels of HIV misconceptions while
   controlling for the effect of the city of residence. Results. More than
   50\% of participants in all study sites were aged 20-49 years, married,
   and have undergone a college or university undergraduate education. Yet,
   a significant proportion (27.2\%) held varying levels of misconceptions
   about HIV. In those with misconceptions, the two most common
   misconceptions were: (i) people are likely to get HIV by deep kissing,
   putting their tongue in their partner's mouth, if their partner has HIV
   (40.1\%); and (ii) taking a test for HIV one week after having sex will
   tell a person if she or he has HIV (31.6\%). Discrimination (beta =
   0.23, p < 0.05, 95\% CI = 0.01, 0.46), negative condom attitudes (beta =
   0.07, p < 0.05, 95\% CI = 0.01, 0.12), and sexual debut at an older age
   (beta = 0.06, p < 0.05, 95\% CI = 0.01, 1) were associated with more HIV
   misconceptions. Being born in Canada (b = -0.96, p < 0.05, 95\% CI =
   -1.8, -0.12), higher education (beta = -0.37, p < 0.05, 95\% CI = -0.52,
   -0.21), and being more resilient (beta = -0.04, p < 0.05, 95\% CI =
   -0.08, -0.01) were associated with fewer HIV misconceptions. Conclusion
   and recommendations. HIV misconceptions are still common, especially
   among HBM. These misconceptions are associated with structural and
   behavioural factors. We recommend structural and policy-driven
   interventions that promote more accessible and equity-driven healthcare,
   education, and social integration of HBM in Ontario. We also recommend
   building capacity for collective resilience and critical health and
   racial literacy as well as creating culturally safe spaces for
   intergenerational dialogues among HBM in their communities.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a new search algorithm, denoted PN{*}, for AND/OR
   tree starch. The algorithm is based on proof-number (PN) search, a
   best-first search algorithm, proposed by Allis et al. {[}Artificial
   Intelligence 66 (1) (1994) 91-124], and on Korf's RBFS algorithm
   {[}Artificial Intelligence 62 (1) (1993) 41-78]. PN{*} combines several
   existing ideas. It transforms a best-first PN-search algorithm into an
   iterative-deepening depth-first approach. Moreover, it is enhanced by
   methods such as recursive iterative deepening, dynamic evaluation,
   efficient successor ordering, and pruning by dependency relations. The
   resulting algorithm turns out to be highly efficient as witnessed by the
   experimental results.
   The PN{*} algorithm is implemented in a tsume-shogi (Japanese-chess
   mating-problem) program, and evaluated by testing it on 295 notoriously
   difficult tsume-shogi problems tone problem has a depth of search of
   over 1500 plies). The experimental results are compared with those of
   other programs. The PN{*} program shows by far the best results, solving
   all problems but one. Needless to say, it outperforms the best human
   tsume-shogi problem solvers by far. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {A wave of attempted domestic terrorism attacks in 2009 and 2010 has
   sharpened attention to the threat of domestic-source terrorism inspired
   or directed by al Qaedo. Seeking to preempt that terror, governments
   face an information problem. They must separate signals of terrorism
   risk from potentially overwhelming background noise and persuade juries
   or fact finders that those signals warrant coercive action. Selection of
   accurate signals of terrorism danger in the information-poor
   circumstances of domestic counterterrorism is arguably a central
   challenge today for law enforcement tasked with preventing further
   terrorist attacks. To an underappreciated extent, governments have used
   religious speech as a proxy for terrorism risk in order to resolve this
   signaling problem. This Article analyzes the legal and policy
   significance of state reliance upon religious speech as a predictor of
   terrorism risk. Constitutional doctrine under the Religion Clauses does
   recognize interests implicated by the signaling function of religious
   speech. Yet analysis suggests that such doctrinal protection is fragile.
   Symptomatic of a wider inflexibility of pre-9/11 constitutional
   doctrine, this doctrinal protection shows little capacity for responsive
   change. The absence of constitutional barriers, however, does not mean
   government should persist in relying on religious speech as a signal.
   Rather, analysis of counterterrorism policy concerns suggests another
   path. Institutional considerations and an emerging social science
   literature on terrorism suggest that religious speech is ill suited to
   the signaling role it now plays. Instead, empirical social science on
   terrorism points to the epistemic superiority of a different signal..
   the close associations of a terrorism suspect. The Article concludes by
   examining the constitutionality of such a signal and elaborating ways
   that insight from the new social science of terrorism can be realized
   without compromising important individual interests.},

Abstract = {This article has three main contributions to our understanding of
   minimax search:
   First, a new formulation for Stockman's SSS{*} algorithm, based on
   Alpha-Beta, is presented. It solves all the perceived drawbacks of
   SSS{*}, finally transforming it into a practical algorithm. In effect,
   we show that SSS{*}=Alpha-Beta+transposition tables. The crucial step is
   the realization that transposition tables contain so-called solution
   trees, structures that are used in best-first search algorithms like
   SSS{*}. Having created a practical version, we present performance
   measurements with tournament game-playing programs for three different
   minimax games, yielding results that contradict a number of
   publications.
   Second, based on the insights gained in our attempts at understanding
   SSS{*}, we present a framework that facilitates the construction of
   several best-first fixed-depth game-tree search algorithms, known and
   new. The framework is based on depth-first null-window Alpha-Beta
   search, enhanced with storage to allow for the refining of previous
   search results. It focuses attention on the essential differences
   between algorithms.
   Third, a new instance of this framework is presented. It performs better
   than algorithms that are currently used in most state-of-the-art
   game-playing programs. We provide experimental evidence to explain why
   this new algorithm, MTD(f), performs better than other fixed-depth
   minimax algorithms.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether scientific reasoning skills predict people's
   susceptibility to epistemically suspect beliefs and cognitive biases. We
   used the recently developed Scientific Reasoning Scale (SRS) because it
   measures the ability to read and evaluate scientific evidence. Alongside
   the SRS, 317 participants aged 18-30 years completed measures of
   thinking dispositions and cognitive ability to ascertain whether the SRS
   contributes specifically to susceptibility to epistemically suspect
   beliefs and cognitive biases. Scientific reasoning correlated positively
   with dispositions towards analytic thinking and cognitive ability and
   negatively with dogmatism, epistemically suspect beliefs, and
   susceptibility to cognitive biases. Most importantly, it emerged as a
   significant predictor, contributing to susceptibility to both cognitive
   biases and epistemically suspect beliefs over and above the other
   cognitive predictors. These results provide the first empirical evidence
   that scientific reasoning ability is an important factor in protecting
   against epistemically suspect beliefs and in aiding better decision
   making among the non-scientific population.},

Abstract = {During a global health crisis, people are exposed to vast amounts of
   information from a variety of sources. Here, we assessed which
   information source could increase knowledge about COVID-19 (Study 1) and
   COVID-19 vaccines (Study 2). In Study 1, a US census matched sample of
   1060 participants rated the accuracy of a set of statements and then
   were randomly assigned to one of 10 between-subjects conditions of
   varying sources providing belief-relevant information: a political
   leader (Trump/Biden), a health authority (Fauci/CDC), an anecdote
   (Democrat/Republican), a large group of prior participants
   (Democrats/Republicans/Generic), or no source (Control). Finally, they
   rated the accuracy of the initial set of statements again. Study 2
   involved a replication with a sample of 1876 participants and focused on
   the COVID-19 vaccine. We found that knowledge increased most when the
   source of information was a generic group of people, irrespective of
   participants' political affiliation. We also found that while expert
   communications were most successful at increasing Democrats' vaccination
   intentions, no source was successful at increasing Republicans'
   vaccination intention. We discuss these findings in the context of the
   current misinformation epidemic.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to reveal both the effect of the perception of
   COVID-19 on avoidance behaviors and the mediating role of the perception
   of personal control in this relationship. COVID-19 emerged in December
   2019 and since then, it has spread globally in a short period and has
   affected people socially, economically and culturally.
   Design/methodology/approach The data for the research was collected from
   418 participants during COVID-19, through online questionnaires. The
   obtained data were analyzed through AMOS and SPSS software using
   structural equation modeling. Findings The research results show that
   some perceptions of COVID-19 affect avoidance behavior and that personal
   control has a mediating role. It has also been found that gender plays a
   moderating role in the relationship between COVID-19 and avoidance
   behavior. It has been found that women are especially more sensitive
   compared to men in perceiving COVID-19. This study also found that
   perception of COVID-19 changes depending on income. Practical
   implications After the pandemic is over, people will get in contact with
   each other less than before, and trade will change accordingly. People
   will avoid shopping in crowded places, and consumer behaviors will
   undergo different changes. All of these results considered, it is
   expected that avoidance behavior will cause some permanent behavioral
   changes in consumers. Originality/value The study answers the critical
   question about the effect of the perception of COVID-19 on avoidance
   behavior. Furthermore, the role of income level, gender and education in
   this relationship will be highlighted.},

Abstract = {What are the political roots of anti-Jewish rhetoric? To address this
   ever-important query, this study analyses perceptions of Jews in Turkish
   politics. Building on group position theory and the historical
   background of Turkish-Jewish relations, the research proposes that
   right-wing ideological orientation and perceived threats can predict
   negative perceptions of Jews. It scrutinises the Turkish parliamentary
   proceedings using quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The
   findings support the premise. The study concludes that discussing
   perceived threats tends to evoke negative rhetoric while right-wing
   ideological orientation seems to be a predictive factor for the
   expression of such views. This implies that an effective management of
   perceived threats would reduce the frequency of anti-Jewish statements
   in Turkish politics.},
