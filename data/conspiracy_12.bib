Abstract = {After the bloody devastation inflicted by the West on subalternity,
   there is the colonial tattoo that no one wants; since, the rejection of
   this mark makes suppose the degree of resistance and counterhegemonic
   action defined by the Amuyawi in the face of the global atmosphere of
   epistemological totalization. The pivotal proposal carefully exposes the
   origin of the Amuyawi of Frontier for the America of Colors and the
   philosophical parallelism with Slavoj Zizek. For this event, the
   elementary principles of the Amuyawi of Frontera and its respective
   methodology are analyzed; the role of the counter-system thinker against
   the philosophy that contemplates universal epistemology is also
   evaluated; likewise, the meeting of two abyssal worlds in their
   intentionality regarding the endotransterritorial dynamics of their
   inhabitants enters the debate and, on the other hand, the parallelism of
   slovenian with emerging thinking is verified; later, making use of the
   conspiracy theory, enters the topic widely commented by the inhabitants
   of the Muchedad, called: the danger under suspicion. Arrived at the
   final section, the principle of distrust towards the closest being
   arises under the premise of: ``protect them, but do not trust them{''},
   thus causing the return of totalitarian powers without counterpower on
   the verge of a highly lethal virus. Within this line, the study is
   obstructed, opening a way to reflect.},

Journal = {SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, various officials flagged the
   critical threat of false information. In this study, we explore how
   three major social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube)
   responded to this ``infodemic{''} during early stages of the pandemic
   via emergent fact-checking policies and practices, and consider what
   this means for ensuring a well-informed public. We accomplish this
   through a thematic analysis of documents published by the three
   platforms that address fact-checking, particularly those that focus on
   COVID-19. In addition to examining what the platforms said they did, we
   also examined what the platforms actually did in practice via a
   retrospective case study drawing on secondary data about the viral
   conspiracy video, Plandemic. We demonstrate that the platforms focused
   their energies primarily on the visibility of COVID-19
   mis/disinformation on their sites via (often vaguely described) policies
   and practices rife with subjectivity. Moreover, the platforms
   communicated the expectation that users should ultimately be the ones to
   hash out what they believe is true. We argue that this approach does not
   necessarily serve the goal of ensuring a well-informed public, as has
   been the goal of fact-checking historically, and does little to address
   the underlying conditions and structures that permit the circulation and
   amplification of false information online.},

Title = {Anti-vaccine movements - a form of social activity for health care,
   ignorance or diversion aimed at destabilizing the health situation? Part
   1. Epidemiological safety. Vaccinations - pros and cons},
Journal = {ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {544-552},
Abstract = {Introduction. Vaccinations are a way accepted by science of preventing
   infectious diseases. Because of their epidemiological significance,
   vaccinations are considered compulsory in many countries and their
   evasion is penalized. Anti-vaccine movements may pose a threat to the
   epidemiological situation in many countries. The study presents the
   arguments formulated by opponents of vaccination and provides
   counter-arguments.
   Materials and method. The study is based on the analysis of data stored
   in scientific databases, information obtained from Googie, Bing and
   Yahoo on the Internet, as well as newspapers, magazines and
   opinion-forming websites.
   Results. The slogans propagated by anti-vaccination movements are
   usually based on easily proven erroneous theories and lies, although
   there are also arguments expressing belief in the conspiracy of
   governments, politicians and vaccine manufacturers, or incompetence of
   scientists and practitioners.
   Conclusions. In recent years in Poland, the activity of movements
   against vaccination has increased significantly, and their propaganda,
   through its negative impact on social attitudes, threatens to
   destabilize the epidemiological situation. Analysis of arguments used by
   the opponents of vaccination suggests a lack of reliable knowledge,
   religious overtones (addressed to people with fundamentalist
   personalities), or the ill-will attitudes of anti-vaccine
   individuals/groups used for their own purposes. Familiarization with the
   arguments of anti-vaccine propaganda is necessary in order to implement
   effective methods of fighting such attitudes and beliefs.},

   unambiguous decomposition of disc galaxy rotation curves into the
   corresponding components. Several methods have been proposed to counter
   this difficulty, but their results are widely discrepant. In this paper,
   I revisit one of these methods, which relies on the relation between the
   halo density and the decrease of the bar pattern speed. The latter is
   routinely characterized by the ratio R of the corotation radius R-CR to
   the bar length L-b, R = R-CR/L-b. I use a set of N-body+SPH simulations,
   including subgrid physics, whose initial conditions cover a range of gas
   fractions and halo shapes. The models, by construction, have roughly the
   same azimuthally averaged circular velocity curve and halo density and
   they are all submaximal, i.e. according to previous works, they are
   expected to have all roughly the same R value, well outside the fast bar
   range (1.2 +/- 0.2). Contrary to these expectations, however, these
   simulations end up having widely different R values, either within the
   fast bar range or well outside it. This shows that the R value cannot
   constrain the halo density, nor determine whether galactic discs are
   maximal or submaximal. I argue that this is true even for early-type
   discs (S0s and Sas).},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is twofold: to explore the
   difficulties and potential of turning to the perpetrator of sexual
   violence; and to track the affective economy of engaging with
   perpetrator accounts.
   Design/methodology/approach - This chapter will consider one of the
   earliest feminist studies of incest, Sandra Butler's (1978) Conspiracy
   of Silence: The Trauma of Incest, followed by an analysis of Philippe
   Bourgois' (1995, 1996, 2004) ethnographic study of Puerto Rican crack
   dealers. These are important studies for the fact that both Butler and
   Bourgois let the men speak freely of their violence, which for the
   Puerto Rican cracker dealers include tales of gang rape.
   Findings - The chapter endorses the need to study the perpetrator,
   arguing that it is imperative to ensure the demythologization of
   perpetrators. It finds also that feminists must explore how they will
   teach emotionally difficult material, and how they negotiate the legacy
   of radical feminism. The chapter concludes that there are times when
   politics requires little theoretical innovation, requiring instead a
   willingness to repeat known insights and to fight back with words.
   Social implications - This chapter has implications for classroom
   practice.
   Originality/value - The value of this chapter is its demand to
   reconsider the doing of feminism in the classroom when the split between
   feminist theory and activism appears greater than ever.},

Abstract = {After the Supreme Court's 2007 decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
   Twombly, an antitrust plaintiff who tries to plead an agreement in
   restraint of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act must allege more
   than parallel conduct and an undefined ``conspiracy.{''} Now, the
   complaint must include ``enough factual matter (taken as true) to
   suggest that an agreement was made.{''} Although the Court insisted it
   was not imposing a heightened pleading standard, it did require
   antitrust plaintiffs to provide enough details to make the claimed
   agreement plausible. In this article, I examine an important substantive
   consequence of Twombly's pleading regime. In more than twenty reported
   cases, federal courts have applied the new pleading standard to
   complaints alleging horizontal concerted action under Section 1 of the
   Sherman Act. In doing so, the courts have had to address a crucial
   defect in the substantive law of agreement: the Supreme Court's
   traditional definitions of agreement, which Twombly itself simply
   repeated, are too vague to help litigants and courts distinguish between
   consciously parallel conduct and concerted action. In the course of
   applying Twombly, however, the lower courts have adopted a more
   meaningful definition, one that requires that the parties have
   communicated to each other in ways that facilitate the parallel conduct.
   This clarification of the standard has important implications for the
   role of discovery in pleading and resolving claims of concerted action.},

Abstract = {The Low Countries, left in trust to Infant Isabel, develop a kind of
   independence from Madrid. As the clashes between France and Spain take
   place along this northern border, this new organization may look
   favorable to the action of french diplomacy. The resumption of the war
   against the United Provinces will upset again the fragile equilibrium of
   these regions. The correspondence written by three French envoys, Baugy,
   Brasset and Bautru, permits to witness these dangerous developments, but
   also to see how the Infant's court sets itself at the crossroads of the
   international tensions that leave their mark on the political life of
   the Low Countries. Brussels then turns into an observation post and a
   negotiation ground for the major powers. The city offers a kind of
   freedom for the representatives of the king of France who can thus have
   access to information, all the more so as the city imposes itself as a
   necessary crossroads where all information converge. A land of fighting,
   the southern Low Countries are also a land of discussions, of discreet
   talks. of political confrontations but also of secret plots if not of
   outright conspiracies. Inside the country, France's agents try to pit
   the local nobilities against the Spanish authorities, but also to launch
   political attacks towards the outside, against the enemies of France.},

Abstract = {The Adler relation between reactions initiated by neutrinos and pions is
   easy to misinterpret as a manifestation of the pion pole dominance. An
   axial current, however, cannot fluctuate into a pion, but only to heavy
   axial-vector states, since the lepton current is transverse. This is the
   miracle of the PCAC hypothesis which dictates a specific conspiracy
   between the heavy fluctuations, so that all together they mock the pion
   pole. Indeed, the observed Q(2) dependence of the axial form factor is
   controlled by the effective mass m(A) similar to 1 GeV, rather than the
   pion mass. On the contrary, the onset of nuclear shadowing is governed
   by the small pion mass, rather than by the large axial mass scale. This
   is in variance with the conventional wisdom which equates the
   fluctuation lifetime and the coherence time. For the case of axial
   current they are different by almost two orders of magnitude. As a
   result, neutrino interactions are shadowed at very low energies of few
   hundred MeV, while energy of about 10 GeV is needed to access nuclear
   shadowing for the vector current. On the contrary to naive expectations,
   nuclear absorption enhances, rather than suppresses the cross section of
   coherent neutrino-production of pions which is the strongest channel
   (half of the total cross section) in the black disc limit.},

Title = {Corpus Approaches to Analysing Uncertainty and Ignorance in Academic
   Discourse},
Journal = {FACHSPRACHE-JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION},

Abstract = {The article provides an overview of corpus approaches to researching
   linguistic practic-es for dealing with ignorance and uncertainty.
   Uncertainty and ignorance are first and foremost epistemological or
   socio-psychological categories rather than linguistic ones. But they can
   be applied to a corpus linguistic setting. Based on a presentation of
   the central terms and their rel-evance for digital corpus research, this
   paper exemplifies proposals for operationalisations using a corpus of
   political science texts from the field of International Relations
   (DIReC). It gives an overview of various methods of researching
   ignorance and uncertainty in academic discourse, focusing on
   lexicon-based, annotation-based and pattern-search-based approaches as
   well as combinations thereof. The structure of the explanations reflects
   a central conflict of aims: On the one hand, corpus-based research on
   ignorance and uncertainty requires a precise, interpretive approach to
   the contextual meaning and epistemic function of each individual piece
   of evidence. On the other hand, it seems advantageous to investigate the
   largest possible corpora for reasons of reliability. The final section
   presents an application sketch that addresses and exemplifies sev-eral
   methodological problems. It compares uncertainty markers in political
   science discourse as found in the DIReC corpus with those in conspiracy
   theories, drawing on the LOCO corpus and journalistic discourse
   represented in a reference corpus of US newspapers.},

Abstract = {Education is commonly considered to be a transformational practice that
   contributes both to forging the personality of individuals and to
   promoting social entanglements. For this reason, education always has a
   normative character that rests on a particular concept of what humanity
   and society should be. However, educational policies and practices are
   frequently unaware of these theoretical presuppositions, and for this
   reason, they frequently appear to act in a naive and superficial manner.
   This is particularly the case for citizenship education, which, if
   superficially implemented, risks being distorted into a form of civic
   education that reproduces established norms and social relations,
   without promoting any meaningful social change. Thus, the first part of
   this article aims to deepen the notion of citizenship, in particular by
   studying what the concept of `consensus' means, conceiving of it not as
   a synonym of social resignation, but rather as a collective conspiracy
   towards a common political project. Accordingly, the article defines the
   basic characteristics that education should always possess to
   effectively promote a democratic and participative citizenship
   education. In particular, it identifies five constitutive contrasts in
   relation to the ways in which information is transmitted, reasoned,
   emotionally perceived, and then discussed and countered both by
   individuals and society. The article therefore presents an overall
   theory of education, seen as a momentous practice of dialogue and common
   action that opens the way for a democracy in progress.},

Abstract = {This is the story of history of science, and why in the twenty-first
   century it ended up curating the legacy of science, as we knew it. Once
   upon a time, history of science lived quietly and studious next to the
   Natural and the Medical Sciences and their wax models, their herbaria,
   the geological collections, and all the scientific instruments that once
   had been modern. Suddenly, around 1980, new interests in Philosophy,
   Sociology and Cultural Studies arose. Provocative research questions as
   for example the history of rationality, the history of the subaltern
   technicians in the laboratory, and the ontology and epistemology of the
   hybrids between nature and culture inspired the intellectual
   discussions. Although the field flourished, received an abundance of
   funding and could even build up its own research institutes, after the
   Millennium, its very existence became gradually jeopardized. Science as
   we knew it since the Enlightenment lost grounds. The New Economy and not
   the state anymore provided the funding for research. History of science
   didn't succeed to survive as expert for data, blind spots, fakes,
   misinformation, lies, conspiracy theories, and historical thinking in
   times of scientific accelerations. It began with the loss of reputation,
   followed by the loss of the job. At the end, history of science lived,
   not unhappily, ever after as curators of the legacy of Science as we
   knew it.},

Abstract = {Although the titular nation of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic
   was Turkic speaking and had strong cultural and historical ties with
   Iran, the Soviet regime constructed a national identity that was
   divorced from its Turkic and Iranian past. The current literature cannot
   provide the exact period when this construction was put forward and
   generally argues that the Azerbaijani identity was artificially created
   as part of a broader divide-and-rule policy that was applied to all the
   Turkic nations in the Soviet Union. However, this thesis by itself does
   not explain why this change from a Turkic identity to an Azerbaijani one
   happened seventeen years after the Bolsheviks assumed power in Baku, and
   its simple causation makes it sound more like a conspiracy theory, which
   had a certain popularity in the Cold War era, than a scholarly argument.
   By presenting a broader view, the paper explains why and when the
   national identity in Soviet Azerbaijan was altered from Turkic to
   Azerbaijani. It argues that there were many factors that induced the
   Bolsheviks to take this extraordinary step in 1937. In fact, the change
   in defining national identity in Azerbaijan was a result of a
   combination of developments in the 1930s in Turkey, Iran, Germany, and
   the Soviet Union. The article concludes that these developments left
   Soviet rulers no choice but to construct an independent Azerbaijani
   identity.},

Abstract = {During the disturbances of the League (c. 1584-1596), the city of
   Marseilles offered vigorous resistance to Henry IV of France. Although
   seized by the king, the city remained agitated by factious fighting,
   riots and the fear of foreign conspiracies. Henry IV decided to entrust
   Guillaume Du Vair with the pacification of Marseille, first as president
   of the Justice Court (1596-1599), then as president of the Parliament of
   Provence (1599-1616). This paper illuminates some unknown aspects of
   this well-known magistrate in action. Impregnated with stoicism, he
   always preferred negotiation to repressive measures, and tried to reach
   a juridical compromise in Marseilles: in exchange for her obedience, the
   city would keep her privileges, including those gained during the
   rebellion phase. Besides, Du Vair combined moderate judicial reaction
   with pro-active counter-espionage activity to identify, arrest and
   convict the ex-ligueurs likely to still be in contact with the king of
   Spain. Last of all, his action also had a rhetorical aspect: his
   constant reconciliation discourses strategically cut across the
   aspirations of the local elite for civil liberties. Du Vair did his
   utmost to pacify the ``free town{''}, but the city remained so
   unreliable that Marseilles can be considered as the theater to watch the
   methods and the limits of the ``Henritian restoration{''}, far from
   absolutist standards.},

   Soto, as historical source. In this sense, we argue that this author
   wrote his novel like a new means of communication that would broaden the
   scope of his political position opposed to the Revolucion en Marcha of
   President Lopez Pumarejo which he had already manifested in press notes,
   essays, and radio allocutions. To achieve this purpose, we approach the
   novel with an inter and intratextual perspective, that is, proposing a
   permanent dialogue between the novelistic plot, the published object,
   and the primary sources of that epoch.},

   Conspiratorial Thinking},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The anti-scientific and anti-vaccine movements gained momentum amidst
   the health and socio-economic crisis brought about by the COVID-19
   pandemic. These widespread pseudoscientific beliefs and the endorsement
   of conspiracy theories likely contributed to the COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy. The aim of this study was to explore which variables best
   differentiated between groups of vaccinated (n = 289), vaccine-hesitant
   (n = 106), and vaccine-refusing (n = 146) young adults. The study was
   conducted online at the beginning of the mass vaccination campaign in
   Croatia when the vaccine just became available for younger and
   non-vulnerable members of the general population. The demographic
   variables, COVID-19 anxiety, and conspiratorial thinking regarding
   COVID-19 were entered into the discriminant analysis. The function
   explaining 89.2\% of the group differences, mostly between the
   vaccinated and vaccine-refusing, was largely defined by conspiratorial
   thinking regarding COVID-19 (0.852), followed by variables with
   substantially less discriminative power, including COVID-19 anxiety
   (0.423; lower in the vaccine-refusing group), political orientation
   (0.486; vaccine-refusing leaning less to the left), financial and
   educational status (0.435 and 0.304, respectively; both lower in the
   vaccine-refusing group), and religiosity (0.301; higher in the
   vaccine-refusing group). These results confirm that among young adults,
   the decision to vaccinate against COVID-19 might be heavily influenced
   by one's proclivity to engage in conspiratorial thinking.},

   SARS-COV-2},
Journal = {HEALTH COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 12},
Abstract = {As frontline providers, first responders are not always thought of as
   patients with unique health beliefs. During early and continued
   distribution, many first responders in the United States chose to refuse
   vaccination. Guided by the health belief model and emerging research
   related to SARS-COV-2, the aim of this study was to further explore the
   complex message conditions that contributed to first responders' early
   vaccination decisions. An online survey was conducted between March 1
   and March 31 2021, among first responders in the state of Kentucky,
   which has lagged behind most states in the percentage of the population
   who are fully vaccinated. The first responder sample included
   Firefighters, Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), and paramedics who
   completed a Qualtrics survey that included measures aimed at assessing
   health beliefs about SARS-COV-2, beliefs about SARS-COV-2 vaccines,
   source trustworthiness, and vaccine motivation. First responders were
   also asked to rank the importance of various information sources about
   SARS-COV-2 and its vaccines. Findings suggest significant differences
   exist among first responders who have chosen to receive SARS-COV-2
   vaccines and those who have refused, including source preference,
   conspiracy beliefs, and perceived risk. Future directions, including the
   exploration of institutional mistrust as a health belief are discussed.
   These findings offer practical insights that may improve continuing
   approaches to discover and use preferred communication sources to reach
   the vaccine-hesitant.},

Abstract = {Predator restoration is ecologically important but politically
   controversial. Red wolf (Canis rufus) reintroduction is challenged by
   public criticism and scientific uncertainty. Red wolf taxonomy is a core
   issue, as researchers debate wolves' identity and political stakeholders
   work to interpret technical issues and promote their favored political
   storylines. Red wolf reintroduction critics form a politically important
   discursive community. We analyzed these critics' discourse, identifying
   storylines characterizing science, scientists, and red wolf identity.
   Our corpus was an influential internet thread, active since 2013. We
   found that red wolf restoration opponents accepted the authority of
   science, and felt that science supported their perspective. They
   believed peer reviewed science to be more legitimate than applied or
   management science, that science supported their belief that red wolves
   were not a real species, and that red wolves' status as a species was an
   anti-scientific conspiracy. Red wolf restoration advocates on the thread
   countered these arguments while similarly believing in scientific
   authority. Restoration opponents constantly sought to promote their
   storylines in policy-making venues, and found the red wolf restoration
   program to be corrupt and the reintroduced canids themselves to be
   impure. These storylines parallel similar findings elsewhere,
   highlighting the political challenges faced by predator restoration
   science and policy, the issues of purity complicating many levels of the
   discourse, and the role of online venues as effective spaces to create
   and promote discursive communities and their storylines},

Abstract = {Data communication security is growing day after day with the
   proliferation of cloud computing. It is primarily because of the few
   security constraints and challenges occurring in the cloud environment
   during data transmission. Existing research has shown that the intrusion
   detection system (IDS) centered on the cloud is more complicated. In
   this article, we address the above issues by proposing an
   attention-based recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN). This
   proposed RCNN is used to detect whether the text data are intrusion or
   nonintrusion. The nonintrusion text information is then used for further
   processing and encrypted using a two-way encryption scheme. We introduce
   the elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) approach to increase the
   security-level performance of nonintrusion data. Moreover, the
   integration of ECC with the modified flower pollination algorithm
   (MFP-ECC) creates the two-way encryption scheme, and it is used to
   produce an optimal private key. The encrypted data are then stored in a
   cloud environment by steganography and the data with the sensitive
   information are replaced by some other text, thus providing security to
   the data at rest. The proposed MFP-ECC approach shows maximum breaking
   time results and can also withstand different classical attacks when
   compared with other methods. As a result, the proposed intrusion
   detection and secure data storage mechanism is highly secured and it is
   never affected by any kinds of conspiracy attacks.},

Abstract = {Why do so many otherwise intelligent patients and therapists pay
   considerable sums for products and therapies of alternative medicine,
   even though most of these either are known to be useless or dangerous or
   have not been subjected to rigorous scientific testing! The author
   proposes a number of reasons this occurs: (1) Social and cultural
   reasons (e.g., many citizens' inability to make an informed choice about
   a health care product; anti-scientific attitudes meshed with New Age
   mysticism; vigorous marketing and extravagant claims; dislike of the
   delivery of scientific biomedicine; belief in the superiority of
   ``natural{''} products); (2) psychological reasons (e.g., the will to
   believe; logical errors of judgment; wishful thinking, and ``demand
   characteristics{''}); (3) the illusion chat an ineffective therapy
   works, when actually other factors were at work (e.g., the natural
   course or cyclic nature of the disease; the placebo effect; spontaneous
   remission; misdiagnosis).
   The author concludes by acknowledging that when people become sick, any
   promise of a cure is beguiling. But he cautions potential clients of
   alternative treatments to be suspicious if those treatments are not
   supported by reliable scientific research (criteria are listed), if the
   ``evidence{''} for a treatment's worth consists of anecdotes,
   testimonials, or self-published literature, and if the practitioner has
   a pseudoscientific or conspiracy-laden approach, or promotes cures that
   sound ``too good to be true.{''}},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant challenges for the health
   system across the globe and fueled the surge of numerous rumours,
   hoaxes, and misinformation regarding outcomes, prevention and cure of
   the virus. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had severe political, economic
   and societal effects and affected media and communication systems in
   unprecedented ways. While traditional journalism has tried to adapt to
   the rapidly evolving situation, alternative news media on the internet
   have given the events an ideological spin. These voices have been
   criticised for furthering societal confusion and spreading potentially
   dangerous `fake news' or conspiracy theories via social media and other
   online channels. The impact of the disease and the lack of information
   associated with it have allowed medical misinformation to rapidly
   surface and propagate on various social media platforms. Previous
   studies have highlighted a similar trend during recent public health
   emergencies, mainly the Ebola and Zika outbreaks. Such a phenomenon is
   alarming on both individual and public health levels to the extent that
   governments are realising the gravity and attempting to limit its
   effects. This article offers a unique perspective because it provides
   data-driven qualitative insights into Fijian Facebook posts related to
   infectious disease outbreaks. This study aims to understand public views
   and opinions on Fijian social media during the height of the pandemic in
   2020 and to outline potential for health information.},

Abstract = {This article examines violence against religious minorities, especially
   Shia groups in the democracy of Indonesia, focusing particularly on the
   case of the 2016 anti-Milad Fatimah (Fatimah Birth Commemoration) mass
   mobilization performed by IJABI (The all-Indonesia Assembly of Ahlul
   Bait Associations) in Bondowoso, East Java, Indonesia. This article
   finds that the anti-Milad Fatimah mass mobilization involved alliances
   and conspiracy between Godly Muslim groups with a varied agenda. Sunni
   militant groups from the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), FPI (Islamic Defenders
   Front), Wahabi/Salafi, and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) groups, which
   merged into FOKUS (Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama'ah Communication Forum), were
   the main protagonists who played a key role in driving mass
   mobilization. Unlike previous studies that understood the anti-Shia
   movement merely as a form of affirming Islamic orthodoxy, this study
   finds evidence that there were wider agendas than the theological ones.
   Excluding the Shia from capturing Islamic public space and challenging
   religious authority and local power which was dominated by moderate
   Muslim groups were the socio-political agendas which contributed to the
   anti-Milad Fatimah mass mobilization. The involvement of radical
   Islamist groups, such as the activists of the Tarbiyah and HTI heralded
   a strong political agenda behind mass mobilization. However, the
   ultimate goal of applying Islamic Sharia will never fade from the
   religious movements of Islamist groups.},

Title = {COVID-19 Sensing: Negative Sentiment Analysis on Social Media in China
   via BERT Model},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {138162-138169},
Abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses massive challenges for the
   world. Public sentiment analysis during the outbreak provides insightful
   information in making appropriate public health responses. On Sina
   Weibo, a popular Chinese social media, posts with negative sentiment are
   valuable in analyzing public concerns. 999,978 randomly selected
   COVID-19 related Weibo posts from 1 January 2020 to 18 February 2020 are
   analyzed. Specifically, the unsupervised BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
   Representations from Transformers) model is adopted to classify
   sentiment categories (positive, neutral, and negative) and TF-IDF (term
   frequency-inverse document frequency) model is used to summarize the
   topics of posts. Trend analysis and thematic analysis are conducted to
   identify characteristics of negative sentiment. In general, the
   fine-tuned BERT conducts sentiment classification with considerable
   accuracy. Besides, topics extracted by TF-IDF precisely convey
   characteristics of posts regarding COVID-19. As a result, we observed
   that people concern four aspects regarding COVID-19, the virus Origin
   (Gamey Food, 3.08\%; Bat, 2.70\%; Conspiracy Theory, 1.43\%), Symptom
   (Fever, 2.13\%; Cough, 1.19\%), Production Activity (Go to Work, 1.94\%;
   Resume Work, 1.12\%; School New Semester Beginning, 1.06\%) and Public
   Health Control (Temperature Taking, 1.39\%; Coronavirus Cover-up,
   1.26\%; City Shutdown, 1.09\%). Results from Weibo posts provide
   constructive instructions on public health responses, that transparent
   information sharing and scientific guidance might help alleviate public
   concerns.},

Abstract = {In 1830, Libri announced the finding of a 16-year-long record of daily
   temperature observed in Florence, Italy, by Father Renieri before the
   activity of the Medici Network (1654 to 1670) that is usually considered
   the earliest instrumental series in the world. The Libri announcement
   was supported by the concurrent finding of a box with the early Little
   Florentine Thermometers that survived the Inquisition and was confirmed
   by Schouw, von Humboldt and Maxwell. However, all investigations made to
   find Renieri's observations were fruitless. This paper clarifies this
   complex situation differentiating between myth and reality. A careful
   analysis of the Libri's announcement in the historical context points
   out that Libri made the announcement while escaping for conspiracy from
   Florence and needed a scoop to be introduced in the French Academy of
   Sciences. For this reason he made a deliberate mix of new and old
   assertions, i.e. he claimed to have made new discoveries but without
   explaining too much and reporting misleading details about well known
   stories concerning the earliest meteorological observations. This
   induced people to suppose that further, earlier records existed. The
   consequence of this was that climatologists searched for years the
   claimed records. This paper shows that the Medici Network almost
   certainly contains the earliest exploitable instrumental observations.
   The possibility of finding a short series of observations prior to 1654
   is remote.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War, the international arena has witnessed two
   concurrent worldwide trends. One is the gradual prevalence of
   universalism under the banner of human civilization; the other is the
   gradual revival of nationalism globally under exactly the same heading.
   Both trends are evident in China, a country which in the twenty-first
   century is perceived universally as a rising nation. However, does
   Chinese nationalism necessarily pose a threat to the world? By examining
   two debates on the Chinese intellectual response towards Sino-American
   and Sino-Japanese relations in the early twenty-first century, this
   paper investigates the status of Chinese nationalism. It questions
   whether it is a fixed set of ideas embraced by a solid entity, or
   whether it possesses multiple layers with dual elements contributing to
   both security and insecurity internationally. The paper argues that
   three separate nationalist processes are occurring concurrently but
   independently of each other: the construction of civic nationalist
   values; the development of an international relations strategy assigning
   responsible power to China; and the detection of alleged anti-Chinese
   conspiracies. The effect of the first two would be to encourage regional
   peace, and they could offset fervent nationalist expression. A somewhat
   counter-intuitive result of Chinese nationalism might be that it also
   becomes a stabilizing force within and outside China's borders.},

Abstract = {As threats to human security, epidemics cause fear and anxiety, thus
   generating conspiracy theories, fake news, and discrimination. In 2020,
   the most widespread xenophobic reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic was
   Sinophobia. In comparison, India's response to the pandemic was both
   conventional and exceptional. Like other countries, India recorded a
   surge in Sinophobia; but -remarkably- in Islamophobia too. Turning to
   both history and theory, this paper investigates how Coronavirus got
   transformed into a `Muslim disease' and connected to narratives of holy
   war and Islamization ('Corona Jihad'). We contextualize the 2020
   Covid-related Islamophobic wave within a longer process of demonization
   of the Muslim that is catalysed by the beliefs and policies of Hindu
   nationalism. In light of Muslims' continuing relegation to the fringe of
   the Indian body-politic, we propose an interpretation of the 2020
   disease-induced Islamophobia as scapegoating, based on Rene Girard's
   mimetic theory. In conclusion, the case of Covid-19 in India confirms
   that in divided societies collective threats like epidemics are likely
   to exacerbate already existing forms of discrimination rooted in the
   society's mainstream memory and norms, and highlights the role of
   beliefs in mediating between threat and violence. This case study also
   highlights the deep penetration of communal discourse in India's
   everydayness and its far-reaching implications.},

Abstract = {This study explores the influence of a government's ideology on
   linguistic representation in a news agency that characterizes itself as
   independent. It focuses on the coverage of the Syrian civil war as
   reported by the Iranian news agency Fars, addressing the discursive
   constructions of anti-government powers in relevant online reports
   released between 2013 and 2015. Since the Islamic Republic of Iran was a
   major regional ally of the Syrian government, we questioned the extent
   to which ideological independence could be expected during a politically
   critical time frame. Taking a corpus-based linguistic approach, the
   study explores the semantic macrostructures representing the opposition
   as well as the lexical clusters and keywords characterizing the news
   discourse. The findings indicate that Fars' representation of the Syrian
   Revolution was, to some extent, biased, despite its claimed independence
   of the government's political stance. It excluded the Sunni social
   actors, suppressed the Islamic faction identity of the rebels and
   depicted the uprising as a war against foreign-backed militants. The
   rebels were stereotyped in terms of terrorism and non-Syrians. In
   addition, the analysis reveals Fars' tendency to emphasize the power of
   the government, depicting it as the defender of the Arab land and
   foregrounding the discourse of international conspiracy against Syria.
   The results of this work project the dimension of media bias caused by
   the underpinning political perspective of media institutions.},

Abstract = {This research aimed to uncover collective memory denial of the victims'
   families of Students who died in Trisakti and Semanggi Tragedy
   1998-1999. We described how this pattern of collective memory denial
   works. This research used the qualitative approach to the instrumental
   case study. The participants were three mothers of students who died in
   Trisakti and Semanggi tragedy. We carried out interviews and field note
   as data collecting technique. This data was analysed using thematic
   analysis technique. The result showed that there is a denial of
   collective memory which is experienced by victims' families of students
   who died at Trisakti and Semanggi tragedy. The pattern is formed
   systematically, orderly, and deliberately. This denial showed that the
   government deliberately prevented the people to remember this tragedy.
   Collective memory denial causes so many negative effects, such as
   conspiracy of silence on the people and second victimization for
   victims' families. Moreover, these effects included the form of
   prejudice, mistrust, aversion, and vengeance between the people. When
   social sharing continuously assembles, it will finish the emotional
   problem of a negative event. On the other hand, social sharing will
   develop subjective well-being of the people in that community, not only
   in short-term, but also in long-term. Collective memory which is healthy
   distributed, motivates the community to discuss, express, and cope the
   painful trauma in the past.},

Abstract = {Vsevolod Apolonovich Balitskii was commissar of the Ukrainian Cheka, GPU
   and NKVD. The present article relates his career from the time when he
   entered the Cheka in January 1919 to the end of his long activity as
   head of the Republic's security organs - an activity which started in
   1923 and came to an abrupt end in 1937 at the onset of the Great Terror.
   The first part of the article is based on Ukrainian Communist party
   archives. It studies Balitskii's role in Ukraine's political history
   during the 1920s and 1930s through the countless repressive actions he
   more than once instigated directly. The author pieces together the
   career of this zealous servant of the regime and hangman, his political
   ascension towards the Muscovite center during the darkest hours of the
   interwar period - the famine years of 1932-1933. The second part
   presents him in the defendant's dock and surveys the various charges
   contained in the pretrial investigation of his case, from the most
   grotesque - counterrevolutionary conspiracy - to the most plausible
   Balitskii's political ambitions. This monographic article on a local top
   commander comes within the scope of the history of the regime's first
   generation of leading officials which, aside from the well-known members
   of the Bolshevik Old Guard, remains to be explored in a series of
   biographies.},

Abstract = {Based on the analysis of a streetcar riot that took place on October 4,
   1930 against the Companhia Linha Circular ande Energia Eletrica, both
   firms in charge of trams, elevators, inclined planes, electricity and
   telephony in Salvador, the article examines the usual representation of
   the Bahian elite of social placidity or control over the population
   during the October Revolution of 1930. Our strategic intention is to
   integrate the research on Bahia into macro historical account in terms
   that differ from the perspectives that frame it as a backward or
   marginal place in the Brazilian political process. For us, Bahia appears
   a lot and since the beginning of the revolution. Legalist in the
   beginning, the state has joined the victorial rebels without resisting.
   In this article, Bahia, however, is not a turncoat: it is rather a place
   fractured by the possibility of direct popular action, by the presence
   of men armed by their bosses, by the civil and military conspiracy and,
   finally, by the oligarchic forces allied to Sao Paulo. In particular,
   the article points to the popular force facing real obstacles, either
   the social hierarchies or the existing distances between the areas the
   city where the insurgents acted. It examines how the riot was perceived
   in racial terms and why its authorship was not claimed by any operating
   force in the revolutionary movement.},

Abstract = {If one reads the comments to the chapters of the Discourses on Livy in
   which Machiavelli convicts Christianity as a religion unfit to inspire
   virtue, such a critique seems to emerge as an exceptional case in the
   cultural and religious scenery of early sixteenth-century Italy.
   Perhaps, it was Machiavelli's first critics, from Sepulveda to Osorio
   and Botero, that led historiography to consider such an opinion
   absolutely novel. This has anyway prevented from looking back for a
   better contextualization for it. The essay will try to relate
   Machiavelli with the Roman academicians, the humanist group led by
   Pomponio Leto which was involved in the 1468 conspiracy against Pope
   Paul II. Among the charges brought against the conspirators, the one of
   criticizing Christianity had a central role. The essay attempts a
   reconsideration of the whole issue through an analysis of extant
   documentation starting from the text, published here for the first time,
   of an almost unknown elegy by Marco Antonio Franceschini, Roman humanist
   and close friend of Callimaco Esperiente (Filippo Buonaccorsi). By
   exploiting sources up to now taken into little account, such as Aurelio
   Lippo Brandolini's De comparatione rei publicae et regni, the
   relationship between two apparently opposed cultural worlds, the one of
   the humanistic Academia Pomponiana and Machiavelli's, will appear in a
   completely different view.},

Title = {Gauge theories in anti-selfdual variables},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2013},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {Some years ago the Nicolai map, viewed as a change of variables from the
   gauge connection in a fixed gauge to the anti-selfdual part of the
   curvature, has been extended by the first named author to pure
   Yang-Mills from its original definition in N = 1 supersymmetric
   Yang-Mills. We study here the perturbative one-particle irreducible
   effective action in the anti-selfdual variables of any gauge theory, in
   particular pure Yang-Mills, QCD and N = 1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills. We
   prove that the one-loop one-particle irreducible effective action of a
   gauge theory mapped to the anti-selfdual variables in any gauge is
   identical to the one of the original theory. This is due to the
   conspiracy between the Jacobian of the change to the anti-selfdual
   variables and an extra functional determinant that arises from the
   non-linearity of the coupling of the anti-selfdual curvature to an
   external source in the Legendre transform that defines the one-particle
   irreducible effective action. Hence we establish the one-loop
   perturbative equivalence of the mapped and original theories on the
   basis of the identity of the one-loop one-particle irreducible effective
   actions. Besides, we argue that the identity of the perturbative
   one-particle irreducible effective actions extends order by order in
   perturbation theory.},

Abstract = {In October 2012, a panel of the D. C. Circuit dealt a blow to the United
   States' post-September 11, 2001 decade-long experiment with military
   commissions as a forum for trying Guantanamo Bay detainees.
   Specifically, the court concluded that prior to the 2006 statutory
   reforms, military commission jurisdiction was limited to violations of
   internationally-recognized war crimes; that providing material support
   to terrorism was not an internationally-recognized war crime; and that
   the military commission conviction of Salim Hamdan for material support
   charges based on pre-2006 conduct was therefore invalid. Three months
   later, a panel of the D. C. Circuit reached the same conclusion with
   respect to conspiracy and solicitation charges, and vacated the
   conviction and life sentence of Guantanamo Bay detainee Ali Hamza Ahmad
   al Bahlul. That case is now on appeal to an en banc (full court) panel
   of the D. C. Circuit. This article analyses the D. C. Circuit's ruling
   in Hamdan's case, explaining why the ultimate holding is the right one,
   even though some of the reasoning is flawed, and why the ruling should
   be upheld on appeal. It also highlights the many unresolved questions
   and the implications for the future of military commissions at
   Guantanamo Bay. As the article explains, the D. C. Circuit's rulings are
   a major victory for the rule of law and a major defeat for commissions.},

Abstract = {As used product transactions are currently on the rise, the demand for
   transactions of secondhand digital content will grow in the future;
   thus, learning to make secure transactions while avoiding cyber attacks
   becomes an important issue. In this paper, we combine the new buyer's
   secret key, the new buyer's watermark to embed in resold digital
   content, and the reseller's encrypted watermark, which can prove legal
   ownership of the reseller. Using the privacy homomorphism property of
   RSA and exponential calculus, the original seller of digital content can
   verify the legality of the reseller and the new buyer. We also reduced
   the load of encryption/decryption digital content using a partial
   encryption/decryption algorithm to make our protocol more efficient and
   practical. In the proposed protocol, the seller is not able to conduct
   piracy and easily frame any other innocent secondhand buyer when a case
   of piracy is found. In fact, piracy can be clearly traced using the
   privacy homomorphism property of RSA and the embedded watermark
   mechanism. Further, in the proposed protocol, the seller himself can
   trace the piracy using exponential calculus. Since it is unnecessary to
   trust third party participation, the conspiracy problem is resolved and
   the new buyer is not required to participate in the dispute. Moreover,
   the seller, reseller and new buyer can simultaneously benefit from the
   secondhand transaction.},

Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {80-87},
Abstract = {This article is written on the basis of a significant set of unpublished
   sources that are stored in archival funds of the four archives of our
   country (The State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF), The State
   Archive of the Tomsk Region, The State Archive in Tobolsk and The
   National Archive of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)). In terms of
   methodology, the article is written in the genre of microhistory, which
   means not to examine the ``little things{''} but to study the past in
   details. The aim of the article is to analyze the sociopolitical,
   economic and other factors of the country's life, that caused conflicts
   between the deportees and the indigenous inhabitants of Yakutia in the
   first half of the 1880s. It is shown how micro-historical approach can
   provide a better understanding of macro-historical events of the past
   centuries through the specific example of the quarrel between the state
   criminal Ivan Piskovoy and the indigene of Zhuleysky Nasleg (a rural
   settlement in the Tatta region of Yakutia) Egor Abramov. One episode (it
   was one of everyday life events at first sight) in the history of the
   Yakut political exile in the early 1880s is analyzed against the
   background of the political, social and economic processes in the
   country. The focus is on the relationship between the political convict
   Piskovoy and the local resident of Yakutia Abramov. Piskovoy was exiled
   to Yakutia for participation in the Chyhyryn conspiracy in 1877 among
   the monarchist state peasants of Kiev province. The plot was prepared on
   the initiative and with the direct participation of the well-known
   Russian populists group (Y.V. Stefanovich, L.G. Deitch, I.V.
   Bokhanovsky), which resorted to mystification on behalf of the Tsar. At
   the time this conspiracy made a great stir in the ruling circles and
   caused a lively debate among revolutionaries. They discussed mainly the
   advisability and the permissibility of using immoral means (forgery,
   fraud, imposture) by the revolutionaries for involving the peasantry in
   the struggle against the autocracy. After his arrival at the destination
   point of his exile, Piskovoy was assigned to live in Zhuleysky Nasleg in
   Baturussky Ulus within the Yakutsk district and he was billeted on the
   indigene Abramov's jurt. Forced coexistence within a few months led
   eventually to a bitter quarrel between them. The reason was the
   houseowner's jealousy, who accused the lodger of having an intimate
   relationship with his wife. The apogee of the conflict was a fierce
   scuffle followed by mutual complaints of the participants to a higher
   authority. On the basis of a careful study we draw a conclusion that the
   objective basis of the fierce conflict between them was the authorities'
   unreadiness to change some of the most important aspects of State
   policy. Social contradictions resulted in particular conflicts between
   newly arrived and indigenous population of the Yakutsk region in the
   form of verbal abuse, scuffles, beatings and injuries that have become a
   fairly commonplace phenomenon in the history of the Yakut banishment.
   One of such typical conflicts was the quarrel between Piskovoy and
   Abramov.},

   exceptionally high, due in part to inconsistent policies across local,
   state, and federal agencies regarding preventive behaviors like mask
   wearing and social distancing. Furthermore, vaccine hesitancy and
   conspiracy theories around COVID-19 and vaccine safety have proliferated
   widely, making herd immunity that much more challenging. What factors of
   the U.S. culture have contributed to the significant impact of the
   pandemic? Why have we not responded better to the challenges of
   COVID-19? Or would many people in the U.S. claim that we have responded
   perfectly well? To explore these questions, we conducted a qualitative
   and quantitative study of Florida State University faculty, staff, and
   students. This study measured their perceptions of the pandemic, their
   behaviors tied to safety and community, and how these practices were
   tied to beliefs of individualism and collectivism. We found that
   collectivist orientations were associated with a greater likelihood of
   wearing masks consistently, severe interruptions of one's social life
   caused by the pandemic, greater concern for infecting others, and higher
   levels of trust in medical professionals for behavioral guidelines
   surrounding the pandemic. These associations largely persist even after
   adjusting for political affiliation, which we find is also a strong
   predictor of COVID-19 beliefs and behaviors.},

Abstract = {Existing literature tends to analyse the long-term evolution of the far
   right's world-view rather than how it responds to short-term events.
   This exploratory study, however, analyses how the far right in Norway
   framed the unprecedented global crisis of COVID-19. The data encompasses
   149 Facebook posts, online op-eds, columns, letters to the editor and
   YouTube videos about COVID-19 published between 1 January and 31 May
   2020 by two radical-right parties, three anti-immigration/anti-Islam
   groups, one neo-Nazi social movement, one long-time neo-Nazi solo
   activist and a leading alternative media website in Norway. They
   represent the full range of established and new, minor and leading, and
   radical and extreme far-right actors from the last four decades. Based
   on the material analysed, Mjelde identifies four overarching frames
   related to the world order, governance, immigration and conspiracies, as
   well as nine subframes. A main finding is that conspiratorial distrust
   of the government constitutes a master frame that both the radical and
   the extreme right combine with other frames that reflect key tenets of
   their world-view. The findings underscore, first, the rigidity of the
   far right's world-view; second, contradictory views within the far right
   about the remedy for the pandemic and the state's role; and, finally,
   that China is emerging as a bogeyman on the US/Trump-friendly far right.},

   published by an unknown figure referred to as ``Q.{''} Its
   anti-hierarchical framework and deployment of an unknown leader can be
   understood as a substantial departure from other 21st-century populisms
   that are sustained by the celebrity relationship between a leader (often
   aspiring to or gain-ing political office) and its followers (constituted
   in community through consumption of the leaders' social media posts).
   Reflecting on contemporary debates and insights within cultural studies
   and digital communication literature, this article investigates some of
   the ways in which the spectral leadership of Q presents challenges for
   understanding and appre-hending populist movements. In light of QAnon,
   there is an emerging need to make sense of populisms that are built on
   mythical or anonymous characters rather than on identifiable human
   actors in leadership roles. We begin by discussing the role of key
   practices of contemporary populist leadership and contrast these with
   justice-based populisms that are community-led without the figure of an
   identifiable leader. We argue that, as a populist movement, QAnon fits
   neither of these frameworks and, instead, has drawn on the affordances
   of digital media and its intersections with postmodern hyperreality to
   produce a new formation of populist movement today. Arguing that Q is
   the simulacra of a leader, we theorise the ways in which QAnon fosters
   affiliation and action from its adherents who, themselves, take on the
   role of saviour-leader.},

Abstract = {The presentation of the nazi period, 1933-45, in German history
   textbooks has been completely different in West and East Germany. Each
   side declared the other to be the direct continuation of and no less
   dangerous than the nazi system. While the interpretation remained
   basically the same throughout the existence of the German Democratic
   Republic (1949-90), the main focus in the Federal Republic of Germany
   changed several times. At first, textbooks to a certain extent
   maintained nazi positions (in accordance with conservative nationalist
   policy) on many questions of national interest, engagement and
   expansion. Thus there was hardly any mention of the mass crimes,
   including the killing of Jews. Later, the Holocaust was allocated a
   prominent position. It was not until the end of the Cold War that
   anti-Slav racism and war crimes received the same attention. Authors
   also changed their underlying theories about national socialism. In the
   first decade, the `Hitlerism and single accident' interpretation was
   strongly held, as opposed to that of the victors who believed in `German
   historical continuity and collective guilt'. Quite early on, the
   communist theory of `fascism' as an instrument (almost a conspiracy)
   against socialism was put forward in the East and the theory of
   `totalitarianism', i.e. communism and national socialism as hostile twin
   brothers, was officially promoted in the West. In western textbooks, the
   placing of the nazi period (and crimes) in the continuity of German
   history and society was not seriously discussed before the 1980s.},

Abstract = {Maurice Bardeche is an important neo-fascist writer whose ideas derive
   from those of Pierre Drieu la Rochelle and Robert Brasillach. After 1945
   he argued that right-wing thought had been ghettoized and even
   imprisoned by a post-Nuremberg liberal political establishment. In the
   face of a US military:and cultural occupation of Western Europe and an
   encroaching Communist Soviet menace, Bardeche argued for a united
   European `third force' to confront these two enemies. His dream was of a
   fascist-ruled Europe that would regenerate and defend the continent and
   the West against Communism and liberalism. Organic and idealist fascist
   states, without the faults of Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy would
   implement a moral revolution, bolster economic affairs and prevent
   Europe being swamped by foreign goods, such as Asian electronics. He
   regretted Europe's membership of NATO and its being sucked into Cold War
   conflicts in the Middle East and in support of Israel. Europe's and
   fascism's enemies were blamed for all their ills, and a Jewish
   conspiracy was blamed for its campaign against the world whether in the
   guise of US financial power or through its control of Bolshevism, the
   latter being judged responsible for terrorism and subversion in the
   developing world. Bardeche was purely a warrior of the pen, and was
   important primarily for providing a link between fascism and neo-fascism
   and a training ground for new fascist writers in his journal Defense de
   I'Occident.},

Title = {Money laundering detection system (MLD) (a complementary system of
   Rastin banking)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {354-366},
Abstract = {Purpose-This paper aims to define a new system for detecting
   money-laundering activities by comparing tax payments (especially
   value-added tax) data to banking transactions data.
   Design/methodology/approach-A money laundering detection (MLD) system
   provides the necessary bases for detecting deception and fraud. Though
   MLD is a complementary system of the Rastin Banking system, it can also
   be installed and executed separately.
   Findings-The underground economic activities can be detected and traced
   by comparing banking information and transaction information in MLD
   system. It needs to force the direct transactors or other related forms
   of transaction to perform their money operations through the banks. In
   the next step, the tax information of transactors (in a chain of
   transactions) can be compared with them, and the incompatibility of the
   two sets of data will explore money-laundering operations.
   Research limitations/implications-This system is novel and needs to be
   more elaborate to remove further practical problems and specific cases.
   Practical implications-MLD system provides necessary protection for
   those who perform legal economic activities by detecting financial
   criminals.
   Social implications-Money laundering harms individual and public rights
   as well as economies. Financial crimes, tax evasion, smuggling,
   conspiracy, embezzlement and various other offences are included in the
   general definition of money laundering, so detecting them will lead to
   important economic improvements in the society as well as international
   community.
   Originality/value-MLD system provides structural and electronic bases
   for computerized tax data and banking data comparison.},

Abstract = {In recent years, scholars of Machiavelli have dedicated closer attention
   to, on one hand, the role played by tumults, and the presence of the
   language of jurisprudence in his work. Until now, these two readings of
   Machiavelli have never intersected. This essay aims to show to what
   extent the language of jurisprudence was present in Machiavelli's
   writings on tumults both in his early works, and above all in the
   Florentine Histories. Starting from Machiavelli's analysis of the
   Valdichiana rebellion (1503), the first part of the essay deals with
   `rebellion' as a legal and political issue, as a specific case of the
   crime of lese majesty, discussed among civil and canon lawyers from
   commentaries on the famous imperial laws of Henry VII (1313) up through
   some legal consilia written in defense of Lorenzo de' Medici and the
   city of Florence in relation to the Pazzi Conspiracy (1478), as well as
   first treatise dedicated specifically to the subject of seditions by a
   French jurist (1515). The essay's second part considers the famous
   speech of the anonymous Ciompo in the third book of the Florentine
   Histories, and analyses a passage commonly overlooked by scholars :
   ``When many err, no one is punished{''}. The essay shows that in this
   passage Machiavelli used a juridical principle, a regula iuris, which
   was certainly controversial and very frequently not accepted, but
   theoretically admitted as such. In concluding, the essay proposes some
   possible paths for further researchs.},

Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 crisis has been a fertile ground for
   misinformation due to several factors such as the uncertainty typical of
   crises, the hasty handling of information, the virality provided by
   social networks and the scarce resources that average citizens have to
   discern between what is true and what is false in the health information
   they consume. Objective: In this context, this article aims to
   characterise the COVID-19 hoaxes registered on the Mexican fact-checking
   platforms Animal Politico and Verificado during 2020 and 2021. Method
   and design: The method used in this study was predominantly quantitative
   and took the form of content analysis. This method was applied to hoaxes
   registered on these two fact-checking sites. Results: The primary type
   of hoax encountered was one of deception, followed by
   decontextualisation, exaggeration and joking. Disinformation circulates
   mainly in social media, in various formats that make the false seem more
   credible. We found that public figures and the media contribute to the
   spread of health hoaxes. However, they do not contain hate speech as has
   been the case in other contexts informed by xenophobic and racist
   agenda. Conclusion: The disinformation on COVID-19 registered on the
   Mexican fact-checking platforms Animal Politico and Verificado during
   2020 and 2021 is characterised by a marked concern to question the role
   of vaccination in confronting and controlling the pandemic. In this way,
   denialist, conspiracy and anti-vaccine ideas have come to permeate
   public debate.},

Title = {AN APPLE A DAY DOESN'T KEEP DOCTOR MILES AWAY: THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S
   MISUSE OF THE PER SE RULE IN <i>UNITED STATES V-APPLE</i>},
Journal = {RUTGERS UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {69},

Abstract = {In 2007, the Supreme Court fundamentally altered nearly a century of
   antitrust case law by ruling that long-term contracts between vertically
   oriented firms ought to be analyzed with economic factors in mind,
   rather than subject to per se liability. Yet, eight years later, the
   Second Circuit circumvented that economic analysis by classifying
   vertically collusive behavior as a hub-and-spokes conspiracy. In doing
   so, as this Note's title suggests, the Second Circuit misused the per se
   rule and missed an opportunity to rule on a truly novel legal issue.
   Indeed, this Note will analyze that Second Circuit decision, United
   States v. Apple, in light of the larger history of antitrust law and
   prevailing economic thought. This Note will then use that examination to
   conclude that the Second Circuit erred in using the per se rule to
   analyze Apple's conduct. Rather, the Second Circuit should have used a
   broad-based rule-of-reason analysis that accounted for the Supreme
   Court's decision in Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.
   and the e-book market at the time of Apple's conduct. Ultimately,
   because the Second Circuit failed to consider the effect of Amazon's
   monopoly power, Amazon's potential for predatory pricing, and
   pro-competitive justifications for vertical contracting, the Second
   Circuit misread Leegin and missed its mark to add to the growing RPM
   odyssey in antitrust law.},

Abstract = {The paper seeks to contribute to the discussion among historians about
   the value, as historical sources, of foreign diplomats stationed in
   Russia. Two young men, Hildebrand von Horn, an envoy extraordinaire of
   the Danish king, and the Swede Johan Gabriel Sparwenfeld, a student of
   the Russian language and Russian affairs on a scholarship granted by the
   Swedish king, met in the Russian capital during the summer of 1684. They
   had met before-in 1682 in Copenhagen-but this time their roles were
   quite different, as they were in Moscow as representatives of countries
   with opposite political aims vis-a-vis Russia. Von Horn was in Russia
   for the third time, knew many influential people at court and mastered
   the Russian language. He kept Sparwenfeld informed about what was going
   on behind the scenes at court. This information was written down by
   Sparwenfeld in his diary of the Russian journey, published by the author
   of this paper in 2002.
   In July 1684 von Horn told Sparwenfeld about the execution of ``a noble
   and learned Pole, Negrebetskii{''}. This person, Pavel Negrebetskii, had
   had an important position at court during the reign of Fyodor
   Alekseevich but lost his influence after the death of the Tsar. In
   August the two friends once more discussed Negrebetskii, his torture,
   and the role of I. M. Miloslavskii in his fate. Negrebetskii was accused
   of having taken part in a conspiracy against Sof'ia and her supporters
   in the aftermath of the streltsy uprising in May 1682. The torture was
   stopped by Vasilii Vasil'evich Golitsyn, and Negrebetskii was hastily
   and secretly taken to the Red Square and executed. Why was Negrebetskii
   executed in this way two years after his stated crime? After discussing
   various aspects of the question, this paper gives a possible answer. It
   seems that the real reason was that Negrebetskii did not stop trying to
   make the Polish king intervene on Naryshkina's side in the struggle for
   power between the Miloslavskii and Naryshkin clans. In connection with
   the arrival of an Austrian embassy in Moscow in May-June 1684, a new
   possibility for Negrebetskii to get in contact with Poland offered
   itself in the person of the Habsburg resident in Warsaw, I. Zierowsky.
   Negrebetskii, it seems, took advantage of the opportunity and tried to
   send a letter with Zierowsky to the Polish king, begging the king for
   help and support of Naryshkina and her son. The letter was intercepted,
   and Sof'ia and Miloslavskii decided to get rid of the irritating Pole
   once and for all. His execution also gave a clear signal to Peter's
   supporters that their previous plans were known and that their
   activities were under surveillance. It was not possible to touch the
   main actors in the unrealized conspiracy for political reasons; the most
   active among them was Vasilii Vasil'evich's cousin, Boris Alekseevich
   Golitsyn.
   So, the entries in Sparwenfeld ` s diary about nightly conversations
   between two foreigners in the Russian capital help to shed light on how
   and when Pavel Negrebetskii died, and, hopefully, also why.},

Abstract = {Opponents of COVID-19 measures invoke science in curious ways: they
   collect data, cite scientific studies, and even conduct their own
   research projects. Previous research has explained these scientific
   appropriations as the product of motivated reasoning, the result of
   widespread disinformation, or a populist strategy. This study provides a
   further explanation by focusing on these scientific projects. Drawing
   from repeated interviews with a select group of 36 anti-lockdown
   protesters in Germany, I find that my interviewees draw on scientific
   repertoires in order to overcome information insecurities triggered by
   their discovery of online countermedia. Although the results of their
   scientific efforts often remain inconclusive, through the process of
   doing research, protesters achieve a reorientation in the information
   environment and begin to rely on countermedia as a source of information
   and political opinion. Based on these findings, I argue that protesters
   refer to the sciences as a conversion technique.},

Abstract = {The speed and volume at which misinformation spreads on social media
   have motivated efforts to automate fact-checking which begins with
   stance detection. For fake news stance detection, for example, many
   classification-based models have been proposed often with high
   complexity and hand-crafted features. Although these models can achieve
   high accuracy scores on a targeted small corpus of fake news, few are
   evaluated on a larger corpus of fake and conspiracy sites due to
   efficiency limitations and the lack of compatibility with the actual
   fact-checking process. In this article, we propose a practical two-stage
   stance detection model that is tailored to the real-life problem.
   Specifically, we integrate an information retrieval system with an end
   to end memory network model to sort articles based on their relevance to
   the claim and then identify the fine-grained stance of each relevant
   article towards its given claim. We evaluate our model on the Fake News
   Challenge dataset (FNC-1). The results show that the performance of our
   model is comparable to those of the state-of-the-art models, average
   weighted accuracy of 82.1, while it closely follows the real-life
   process of fact-checking. We also validate our model with a large
   dataset from a real-life fact-checking website (i.e., Snopes.com), and
   the findings demonstrate the capability of the model in distinguishing
   false from true news headlines.},

Abstract = {Semantics is the bridge by which meaning can be studied and texts can be
   understood and, finally, the intentions and implications of divine
   revelations can be discovered. The present study makes use of a
   methodical approach to deal with two essential issues: firstly, the
   semantic analysis of ``furqan{''} will be carried out in the context of
   the holy Quran's verses by way of a semantic study based on the
   linguistic context and investigation of the paradigmatic and syntagmatic
   relationships. Secondly, semantics will be deployed in reply to the
   skepticisms regarding the conceptualization of the word furqan in the
   Holy Quran as stated in the book Letters for the Prophet Muhammad: A
   Research on the Roots of the Quran. In line with investigations, it can
   be said that furqan was syntagmatically used with some words like piety
   and guidance and it was interchangeably used with words such as scale,
   Quran and the book. As a final definition of furqan, we suggest that it
   is not of a lexical character and that it is by exercising the divine
   teachings that one might gain a ``light{''} by means of which one can
   distinguish the right from the wrong and easily overcome the calamities
   and conspiracies of the time. Accordingly, the claim by the author of
   the book Letters for the Prophet Muhammad to the effect that the term
   ``furqan{''} refers to a book other than the present Quran is rejected.},

Title = {COVID-19 information disorder: six types of harmful information during

Abstract = {The outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 propelled the
   creation, transmission, and consumption of false information -
   unverified claims, misleading statements, false rumours, conspiracy
   theories, and so on - all around the world. When various official or
   unofficial sources issue erroneous, misleading or contradicting
   information during a crisis, people who are exposed to this may behave
   in ways that cause harm to the health and well-being of themselves or
   others, e.g., by not taking appropriate risk reducing measures or
   blaming or harassing vulnerable groups.
   To work towards a typology of informational content that may increase
   people's vulnerability in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, we
   explored 98 instances of potentially harmful information that spread in
   six European countries - France, Italy, Norway, Finland, Lithuania, and
   Estonia - between March and May 2020.
   We suggest that during the pandemic, exposure to harmful information may
   have made people more vulnerable in six ways: (1) by discouraging
   appropriate protective actions against catching/spreading the virus, (2)
   by promoting the use of false (or harmful) remedies against the virus,
   (3) by misrepresenting the transmission mechanisms of the virus, (4) by
   downplaying the risks related to the pandemic, (5) by tricking people
   into buying fake protection against the virus or into revealing their
   confidential information, and (6) by victimising the alleged spreaders
   of the virus by harassment/hate speech. The proposed typology can be
   used to guide the development of risk communication plans to address
   each of these information-related vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {The internet immerses us in waves of traumatic information, leaving us
   desperately crawling through media wreckage to make sense of the world.
   We are left alienated from a reality that never settles into a cohesive
   narrative. Media wreckage in my argumentation denotes the fragmentation
   of reality occasioned by the digital acting as the dominant
   epistemological source of the real in the twenty-first century. The
   atomisation of reality into the porous realm of the digital has spawned
   conspiratorial internet sub-cultures dedicated to immersing us all in a
   state of perpetual crisis. Conspiracy theories like crisis acting are
   thriving in this milieu. This theory was popularised by the host of
   InfoWars Alex Jones who argued high school shootings are events staged
   by the government. This article appropriates the term `crisis acting'
   from the alt-right political lexicon to analyse how the experience of
   living in media wreckage is performed on the intermedial stage of The
   Destroyed Room (Vanishing Point 2016). The performance is a
   semi-improvised conversation between three actors who debate the
   morality of watching videos depicting Islamic State executions, the
   Islamist terrorist attacks in Paris, the refugee crisis and scenes of
   natural disasters. Terror, social media and climate breakdown constitute
   the three pieces of media wreckage that are staged The Destroyed Room.
   It is argued that constructing narratives of reality with media wreckage
   turns us all into crisis actors who cannot imagine ways of performing in
   the world as political agents outside of digital spaces.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the deep political and cultural impact of the
   plane crash on April 10, 2010. The tragedy that cost the life of a
   president, Lech Kaczynski, his wife, and a group of leading
   parliamentarians across political divides took place near the
   traumatically laden site of the Katyn forest and has led to a crisis of
   communal symbolic language. The crisis has been apparent in the radical
   polarization of Polish society over the rhetoric of the main political
   parties and their interpretations of the crash. However, the crisis
   transcends the political arena and indicates that Polish society no
   longer shares a unifying meta-narrative to form its sense of national
   identity. The author analyzes this process of societal polarization by
   looking at the stages of mourning-shock of the symbolic absurd,
   communitas, and the Wawel controversy-and the utilization of the
   communal affect in the presidential campaign led by the president's twin
   brother, Jaroslaw Kaczynski. The campaign is characterized by the
   appropriation of the crash as Law and Justice's ``foundational myth{''}
   coupled with the language of indeterminacy and deferral to define a
   political program. At the same time, the crisis is fueled by the
   utilization of a reductive version of the Romantic paradigm, in which
   the late president is sacralized (as in Rymkiewicz's poem) and by the
   proliferation of conspiracy theories that antagonize the society towards
   the current government and Russia.},

Abstract = {University students are a sub-group of the population at high risk of
   COVID-19 infection, and their judgments on vaccination affect the public
   attitudes towards vaccination. Thus, the present study aimed to assess
   the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and acceptance of the COVID-19
   vaccine among pharmacy and non-pharmacy students. A cross-sectional
   study was conducted by enrolling pharmacy (375) and non-pharmacy (225)
   students from the universities in Lahore. Chi-square analysis was used
   for significant frequency distributions and a 5-point Likert scale was
   used to score attitude, perception, and acceptance. The majority of the
   students were aged between 19-24 years, hailing from urban and
   middle-class families with good self-reported health. The preferred
   vaccine was Pfizer, followed by Sinopharm and Sinovac. The major source
   of information was social media, followed by government campaigns and
   family members. The pharmacy students demonstrated better knowledge and
   positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination. The non-pharmacy
   students scored higher for the questions based on scientific leads,
   myths, and baffling conspiracies. The non-pharmacy students showed
   higher hesitancy/barrier total scores related to their trust in the
   health system, COVID-19 vaccine storage, and efficacy. Data suggested
   that pharmacy students exhibited better knowledge, positive attitudes,
   and perceptions about COVID-19 vaccination. Overall, vaccine efficacy
   and safety were mutual concerns. Nonetheless, non-pharmacy students were
   hesitant due to mistrust in the health system of Pakistan.},

Abstract = {This study looks at population response to government containment
   strategies during initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in four
   high-trust Northern European countries-Denmark, Germany, the
   Netherlands, and Sweden-with special emphasis on expressions of
   governmental trust. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling analysis were
   performed using Twitter data from three phases during the initial
   European lockdown, and results were compared over time and between
   countries. Findings show that, in line with existing theory, assertive
   crisis responses and proactive communication were generally
   well-received, whereas tentative crisis responses or indications by the
   authorities that the crisis was manageable were generally met with
   suspicion. In addition, while government support was high in all
   countries during the height of the crisis, messages critical of the
   government as well as conspiracy theories were nevertheless widely
   circulated. Importantly, countries with the least assertive strategies,
   rather than clear negative responses, saw heightened polarization of
   sentiment in the population. Furthermore, in the case of Sweden, a
   laissez-faire strategy was generally accepted by the population, despite
   strong criticism from other countries, until mortality rates started to
   rise. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed with an
   emphasis of prior trust as a potential explanatory factor. Future
   research should seek to replicate these findings in other countries with
   different levels of prior governmental trust or with a different
   severity of the COVID-19 outbreak than the countries in this study as
   well as triangulate the findings of this study using alternative
   methods.},

Abstract = {At present, blockchain is not only applied in the financial field, but
   also extended to the medical, insurance, internet of things, and many
   other fields. Its independence leads to more and more significant
   problems of network isolation. To address the problem of the cooperative
   operation between different blockchains, this article proposes virtual
   chain, a storage model supporting cross-blockchain transaction. It not
   only ensures that cross-chain transactions are tamper-proof and
   traceable but also realizes completely decentralized storage. First, to
   tackle the multidimensional heterogeneous problem existing in
   cross-chain trading, a data structure based on prefix tree is proposed
   to manage cross-chain trading data on top of source chain and target
   chain. Second, a signature verification mechanism based on elliptic
   curve is proposed to meet the operational atomicity requirements of both
   parties of cross-chain transaction. Third, the data fusion technology is
   used to expand the block capacity indirectly to achieve the high
   throughput of cross-chain transactions. Finally, by using the
   credibility-based access control and block chain technology to ensure
   the security of the data storage model, and conduct security analysis
   from three aspects of tamper-proof, data protection and anti-conspiracy
   node attack. The experiment shows that the proposed cross-chain
   transaction storage model can realize the efficient storage of the
   heterogeneous data, and satisfy the high requirement of the cross-chain
   transaction. Moreover, the virtual chain storage model establishes a
   safe and reliable working environment.},

Title = {Dark Matter implications of DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 results},
Journal = {PHYSICS LETTERS B},

Pages = {262-269},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Recently, the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration released updated results from
   their search for the annual modulation signal from Dark Matter (DM)
   scattering in the detector. Besides approximately doubling the exposure
   of the DAMA/LIBRA data set, the updated photomultiplier tubes of the
   experiment allow a lower recoil energy threshold of I keV electron
   equivalent compared to the previous threshold of 2 keV electron
   equivalent. We study the compatibility of the observed modulation signal
   with DM scattering. Due to a conspiracy of multiple effects, the new
   data at low recoil energies is very powerful for testing the DM
   hypothesis. We find that canonical (isospin conserving) spin-independent
   DM-nucleon interactions are no longer a good fit to the observed
   modulation signal in the standard halo model. The canonical spin
   independent case is disfavored by the new data, with best fit points of
   a DM mass of similar to 8 GeV, disfavored by 5.2 sigma, or a mass of
   similar to 54GeV, disfavored by 2.5 sigma. Allowing for isospin
   violating spin independent interactions, we find a region with a good
   fit to the data with suppressed effective couplings to iodine for DM
   masses of similar to 10 GeV. We also consider spin-dependent DM-nucleon
   interactions, which yield good fits for similar DM masses of similar to
   10 GeV or similar to 45 GeV. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by

Title = {Virtual Zika transmission after the first US case: who said what and how

Abstract = {Background: This paper goes beyond detecting specific themes within
   Zika-related chatter on Twitter, to identify the key actors who
   influence the diffusive process through which some themes become more
   amplified than others.
   Methods: We collected all Zika-related tweets during the 3 months
   immediately after the first U.S. case of Zika. After the tweets were
   categorized into 12 themes, a cross-section were grouped into weekly
   datasets. to capture 12 amplifier/user groups, and analyzed by 4
   amplification modes: mentions, retweets, talkers. and Twitter-wide
   amplifiers.
   Results: We analyzed 3.057,130 tweets in the United States and
   categorized 4997 users. The most talked about theme was Zika
   transmission (similar to 58\%). News media, public health institutions,
   and grassroots users were the most visible and frequent sources and
   disseminators of Zika-related Twitter content. Grassroots users were the
   primary sources and disseminators of conspiracy theories.
   Conclusions: Social media analytics enable public health institutions to
   quickly learn what information is being disseminated, and by whom,
   regarding infectious diseases. Such information can help public health
   institutions identify and engage with news media and other active
   information providers. It also provides insights into media and public
   concerns, accuracy of information on Twitter, and information gaps. The
   study identifies implications for pandemic preparedness and response in
   the digital era and presents the agenda for future research and
   practice. (C) 2018 Association for Professionals in Infection Control

Title = {Why adoption is not an option in India: the visibility of infertility,
   the secrecy of donor insemination, and other cultural complexities},

Abstract = {Child adoption in the face of reproduction gone awry continues to remain
   an under researched aspect of contemporary Indian reality. This paper
   seeks to unpack some of the critical cultural issues underscoring the
   deep-seated reluctance towards adoption. Drawing on a larger multi-sited
   research project examining the experience of infertility and assisted
   conception in India, the paper sheds light on the state of current
   adoption practices in India. Thus, when faced with infertility, couples
   in this research emerged as favouring secret gamete donation as a means
   of bypassing infertility rather than the option of adoption.
   Invoking the concept of systematic misrecognition, the paper situates
   the modalities of salvaging infertility, either through medically
   assisted conception or adoption, as structuring infertile people's quest
   for children. The paper relates the perceived stigma associated with
   infertility treatment and adoption with the inclusion of a ``third
   party{''} that fractures the culturally conceptualized boundaries of
   family as inextricably tied to the conjugal bond. It is therefore argued
   that secrecy is born out of a need to obfuscate a ``public and
   visible{''} violation of a culturally priced ideal that views an
   intimate connection between the ``married body{''} and the progeny.
   Adoption continues to remain an undesirable option because the links
   between an adopted child and the social parent become a public, vocal,
   and visible admission of infertility that cannot be subsumed, like
   donated gamete conception, under a conspiracy of silence. (C) 2002

Title = {From pandemic to Plandemic: Examining the amplification and attenuation
   of COVID-19 misinformation on social media},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {328},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study examines the proliferation of COVID-19 misinformation through
   Plandemic-a pseudo-documentary of COVID-19 conspiracy theories-on social
   media and examines how factors such as (a) themes of misinfor-mation,
   (b) types of misinformation, (c) sources of misinformation, (d) emotions
   of misinformation, and (e) fact -checking labels amplify or attenuate
   online misinformation during the early days of the pandemic. Using
   CrowdTangle, a Facebook API, we collected a total of 5732 publicly
   available Facebook pages posts containing Plandemic-related keywords
   from January 1 to December 19, 2020. A random sample of 600 posts was
   subse-quently coded, and the data were analyzed using negative binomial
   regression to examine factors associated with amplification and
   attenuation. Overall, the extended an extended Social Amplification of
   Risk Framework (SARF) provided a theoretical lens to understand why
   certain misinformation was amplified, while others were atten-uated. As
   for posts with misinformation, results showed that themes related to
   private firms, treatment and prevention of virus transmission, diagnosis
   and health impacts, virus origins, and social impact were more likely to
   be amplified. While the different types of misinformation (manipulated,
   fabricated, or satire) and emotions were not associated with
   amplification, the type of fact-check labels did influence the virality
   of misinformation. Specifically, posts that were flagged as false by
   Facebook were more likely to be amplified, while the virality of posts
   flagged as containing partially false information was attenuated.
   Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.},

Title = {Psychiatric and Legal Issues Surrounding the Extradition of WikiLeaks
   Founder Julian Assange: The Importance of Considering the Diagnosis of
   Autism Spectrum Disorder},

Abstract = {Julian Assange is an Australian national and the founder of WikiLeaks, a
   nonprofit organization that publishes news leaks and classified
   information provided by anonymous whistle-blowers. In May 2019, a United
   States federal grand jury returned an 18-count criminal indictment
   against Assange. If convicted, Assange could face up to 10 years of
   incarceration for each Espionage Act (1917) charge and up to 5 years for
   conspiracy to access a government computer network. Due to Assange's
   current physical location in the United Kingdom, the United States has
   requested extradition. However, to date, there has been limited
   scholarly discussion of the relationship between Assange's autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis and his potential extradition and
   lengthy pretrial or postconviction imprisonment in the United States.
   This article explores the psychiatric submissions from Assange and the
   United States in light of available evidence on ASD and the risk of
   suicide among people who are imprisoned. The analysis will focus on
   common misperceptions about ASD, the particularly detrimental impacts of
   the prison environment on individuals with ASD, the varying opinions of
   Assange's ASD diagnosis, and the importance of considering Assange's
   risk of suicide in the context of ASD. From a human rights and
   individual fairness perspective, a complete understanding of the
   significance of these issues which does not minimize a diagnosis of ASD
   is paramount for Assange and any future case with similar elements.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a new synthetic account of the presence of Cicero as
   both character and source in Lucan's Bellum Ciuile. Lucan's treatment is
   derived primarily from Virgil's technique for creating intertextually
   complex characters, but further builds on Sallust's displacement of
   Cicero in his narrative of the Catilinarian conspiracy and on the
   declamatory practice of reducing the orator to a few prominent and
   recognizable traits. Cicero the character, as he briefly appears at the
   opening of the seventh book, is not simply an ahistorical caricature: he
   is constructed through a careful series of allusions designed to indict
   his use of violence in the suppression of Catiline. Other prominent
   aspects of Cicero in the tradition are displaced and transferred to
   other characters more important to Lucan's design, Cato and Pompey.
   Lucan's depiction of Pompey, especially his death and decapitation,
   draws on the language and affect of the tradition associated with
   Cicero, using Cicero's own words and the obituary of Cicero in the lost
   historical epic of Cornelius Severus. Finally, the language of Cicero's
   peace-making efforts in his correspondence, suppressed in Lucan's
   depiction of him as a warmonger, forms an important part of the
   narrator's own emotional evocations of the impending catastrophe of
   civil war. The combination of models Lucan uses is more broadly
   reflective of his technique in composing a historical epic.},

Journal = {RELIGIONS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Poland is one of Europe's most religious societies. Methods:
   The article presents the results of an online survey conducted in April
   2020 during the period of the Polish government's strictest restrictions
   to date in response to the pandemic. A quota sample of 1001 adult Poles
   was surveyed. Results: Around one-fifth (21.3\%) of people declared that
   they spent more time praying and engaging in other religious practices
   than previously. As many as 61.3\% of people who previously practiced
   religion several times a week spent more time on these practices, and,
   more interestingly, religious observance also increased among people who
   had previously practiced only once every few years (15.9\%) and those
   who had not previously practiced at all (7.4\%). People who previously
   practiced sporadically or not at all, but who began to pray more during
   the pandemic, are found to be distinguished from others by a greater
   fear of losing their job. Spending more time on religious observance is
   shown to be related to, e.g., disregard for some government
   restrictions, possession of less knowledge about COVID-19, and a greater
   tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. Conclusions: Overall,
   religious practices increased during the Polish spring lockdown.
   Although these increases are unlikely to be long-lasting, changes in
   religiosity caused by COVID-19 appear to be a real phenomenon. As the
   pandemic continues, more research on different aspects of this
   phenomenon is needed.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the First World War, British officials were forced
   to contend with a threat that seemed to undermine their empire from
   India to Egypt. The and-colonial revolts that spread across the world in
   this moment were caused by many factors from the collapse of the Ottoman
   Empire to far more local concerns. However, many British officials
   imagined these contemporaneous revolts to be caused by a pan-Islamic
   conspiracy. The threat of pan-Islam was inflated in the minds of these
   officials in large part because it fundamentally contradicted their
   conception of how politics should be ordered on a global scale. This
   article suggests that the spectre of pan-Islam helped to crystallise a
   methodological nationalism in imperial policies over Muslim populations.
   The amorphous spatiality of pan-Islam redoubled a growing commitment to
   bounded national spaces as a natural unit of political activity. To
   those officials obsessed with pan-Islam, it was so frightening precisely
   because it questioned the spatial paradigm through which they understood
   the world. Other officials saw pan-Islam as a minor nuisance, because
   they believe that such transnational politics could not possibly survive
   in a world inherently ordered into contiguous nations. The threat of
   pan-Islam helped to push both sets of officials into a methodological
   nationalism, but some saw nationalism as inevitable while others feared
   that Islam was a compelling threat to a European-dominated
   inter-national order.},

Abstract = {China has to promote its shale gas exploration and exploitation because
   of the need for economic and social development. The huge shale gas
   reserve provides a reliable source for upgrading its economic
   development. This paper analyzes the strategic measures and advantages
   for a safe and vigorous development of shale gas in China and suggests
   the reasons for the financial conspiracy of the shale gas revolution by
   reviewing the developments of hydraulic fracturing technologies in
   China. The three strategic advantages include reserve advantage, market
   advantage, and favorable policies. In addition, three strategic measures
   are proposed: technical innovation, managing system restructuring, and
   infrastructure construction. Some key problems in shale gas stimulation
   are proposed, including the mechanics of fracture network propagation,
   characteristics of fluid flow in horizontal shale gas wells, and the
   outlook for the next research plan and experiments. Due to the imperfect
   managing and running of the systems for China's shale gas development,
   it is argued that China should take some more effective and powerful
   measures, for example, through establishing an overriding authority for
   managing shale gas projects to coordinate the work between ministries
   and agencies, to enhance the efficiency and improve the effectiveness.
   The paper concludes by presenting strategic measures for enhancing the
   construction of infrastructure which is a crucial foundation for the
   shale gas market, such as reinforcing the construction of gas pipeline
   and weakening the threshold of entry requirements for natural gas
   pipelines, to enhance their efficiency.},

Abstract = {Laurent NAGY, A liberal-democrat conspirator under the Restoration: C.-F
   Cugnet deMontarlot. The origin of the development of a Revolutionary
   culture. The reign of Louis XVIII was a period of intense political
   activity. The recent past with its incessant combats over ideological or
   patriotic principles had strongly influenced certain men at the
   beginning of the nineteenth century. With the establishment in 1814 of a
   constitutional monarchy, persons extremely affected by their recent
   political experiences refused to be simple witnesses of events; instead,
   they engaged in political struggles in the name of values they deemed
   fundamental. After twenty-five years of upheaval, they refused to accept
   the peace and order introduced by the presence of Louis XVIII in France.
   By extra-legal means (conspiracies) and clandestine activities (secret
   societies), these men of action would combat, violently, the restored
   political system. Heirs of the Revolution (or of the Counterrevolution),
   they confronted and adapted, beginning in 1815, to the evolution of
   political practices in order to impose their views. This passion led
   them to different parts of Europe, notably to Italy and Spain. These
   persons notably Claude-Francois Cugnet de Montarlot who did not belong
   to either the elites of the Old or the New France found themselves on
   the margins of society. Sincere militants or fanatics of liberty, these
   adventurers by their subversive maneuvers helped to sustain during the
   monarchical restoration the broad movement of ideas begun in 1789.},

Abstract = {Objective: To find the frequency of intentions and it's affecting
   factors of readiness and reluctance for COVID-19 vaccination and their
   association with demographic attributes in Karachi,
   Pakistan.Methodology: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Civil
   Hospital, Karachi and included participants whose age was > 18 years.
   The people who were previously infected with COVID-19 or already
   vaccinated were excluded from the study. Purposive sampling was applied
   to enrol 400 participants and a self-developed questionnaire was
   administered to gather data. Data were analysed using SPSS 20.Results:
   Out of 400 participants, 260 (65\%) were willing and 140 (35\%) were
   reluctant to have COVID-19 vaccination. Willing participants were
   affected by three factors such as vaccination is the 55 (21.1\%) the
   best way to avoid from serious illness, doctors' suggestion 45
   (17.5.0\%), and self and family protection 40 (15.4\%). Reluctant
   participants were also affected by three factors including 22 (15.8\%)
   unforeseen side effects, 25 (18.0\%) belief in conspiracy theory for
   vaccination, and 26 (18.5\%) development of a vaccine is too quick. Age
   and education showed a significant association with the intentions of
   COVID-19 vaccination (p < 0.5).Conclusion: This study highlighted
   that65\% of participants were willing, and 35\% were reluctant to have
   COVID-19 vaccination. Three factors were affected on willingness and
   three factors on reluctance of participants for COVID-19 vaccination.
   Age and gender were found significantly associated with the intentions
   of COVID-19 vaccination.},

Title = {Critical Discourse Analysis of Online Audiences' Comments: Insights From
   The Channels TV's Facebook Audiences' Comments On Farmers-Herders
   Conflicts News Stories in Nigeria},
Journal = {SAGE OPEN},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {This paper interrogated The Channels TV Facebook audiences' discourse on
   selected top five farmer-herder violent conflicts related news stories
   from January 1st to July 31st, 2018 in Nigeria. We specifically examined
   how the audience enacted, reproduced, and/or resisted social power abuse
   and dominance in their discourses on the selected news stories and their
   act of stancetaking. We did this by drawing on Van Dijk's principles of
   Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Du Bois's acts of stancetaking. We
   analyzed 84 (out of the 500) comments and images that directly or
   indirectly made reference to Fulani Ethnic Group (FEG). Finding revealed
   that besides lack of access to discourse control by FEG; online
   audiences' discourses were crafted to enact or reproduce socio dominance
   against FEG using the strategies of generalized ``positive
   self-representation{''} and ``negative representation of Others.{''}
   Findings also showed that the commenters aligned with and amplified
   existing stances like Fulanization/Islamization, political conspiracy,
   leadership failure, and the need to disintegrate the country into
   smaller governable sizes in their comments. We therefore concluded that
   such thread of discourse that generalized criminal acts of few
   individuals on the entire ethnic group could be inimical to the nation's
   goal of national integration, security objectives, and continued
   peaceful and harmonious co-existence among various ethnic groups in
   Nigeria and therefore called for further investigation into why the
   online audiences approached the issues as they did in their discourses.},

Abstract = {In this article, we are arguing for a possibility of a new elemental
   politics as based on breath and fire and gesturing beyond the modes and
   principles of ontology of violence, power struggles and war in
   philosophy and political philosophy. We first discuss the task of
   today's political philosophy as a need to enkindle the humanity towards
   a new alliance in creativity and belonging. We propose a new, elemental
   approach, based on the revitalization of air/breath and fire and present
   Luce Irigaray's thought as a key intervention of this kind within the
   contemporary political thought. The second part brings an analysis of
   texts by Ernst Junger and Alain Badiou on soldiers and war as examples
   of an unfortunate philosophical adventure. The third part is our
   proposal for another genealogy of human beings as breathers and igniters
   within the new peaceful and mindful culture of democracy, providing us
   with a possibility of a new ethico-political order, as based on the
   elemental constellations of silence, breath and fire. Finally, the idea
   of a quiet democracy is established, as a place of inner horizontal calm
   being gathered and cultivated in us by fire, and as a place for beings
   of this Earth to breathe and to share the air within a new
   elemental-spiritual conspiracy of love. Towards the conclusion, this
   essay also is a hommage to Luce Irigaray's approaches to ancient Indian
   religious and philosophical thinking.},

Title = {A Too Free Conduit? When the Flow of Men and Ideas Turned against Marie
   de Guise},
Journal = {ETUDES EPISTEME},
Year = {2020},
Number = {37},
Abstract = {The purpose of this essay is to describe the way in which the
   substantial circulation of men and ideas between France and Scotland
   ultimately turned against Marie de Guise and the kingdom of France in
   the years 1559 and 1560. In order to build a Franco-Scottish kingdom, an
   initial step towards a Franco-British Empire, the King of France, Henri
   II, helped increase this trans-Channel circulation of men and ideas.
   Henri II's goal was to forge an alliance with both Scottish and English
   opponents of the Catholic Mary Tudor, particularly by supporting and
   employing notable Scottish Protestant figures. This policy failed after
   the Scots' growing concerns about the ``Frenchification{''} of their
   government encountered a new English political context in which a
   Protestant queen, Elizabeth Tudor, took the throne. The open conduit
   backfired against French ambitions and against the Regent of Scotland,
   Marie de Guise. The rebellion in Scotland that began in 1559 proved
   successful by 1560. It was a swift victory by the Protestant Lords that
   was partly due to the fact that they allied themselves with England
   after long benefiting from a highly tolerant French attitude. The
   English takeover of cross-Channel communications led to the isolation of
   the French army in Scotland and, with the Amboise conspiracy in 1560, to
   the opening of a second front in France. Significantly, a number of
   Protestant Scots officially serving the King of France were also double
   agents for the benefit of England.},

Abstract = {In the summer of 1943, Fred Rose, a candidate for the Labour Progressive
   Party, a Communist Party alias, was elected to the Canadian Parliament
   in a by-election in the federal constituency of Cartier, a working-class
   district in the city of Montreal. The margin of victory was thin.
   Cartier had a mixed Jewish and French Canadian demography. Whose votes
   won the day for Rose in 1943 remains unclear.(1) Re-elected in 1945, in
   September of that year a Soviet encryption specialist named Igor
   Gouzenko, notified that he was to be recalled to Moscow, fled the USSR's
   Ottawa embassy with dozens of documents he hoped to trade for asylum.
   The documents revealed that the embassy was a hothouse of espionage and
   identified the Member of Parliament (M.P.) Fred Rose as a major player
   in the scheme. A few months later, Rose was arrested, put on trial, and
   convicted of conspiracy to violate Canada's Official Secrets Act. The
   head of the Communist Party of Canada (CPC), Tim Buck, claimed the Party
   was completely innocent of any involvement in Rose's espionage activity.
   Following Rose's release from prison in 1953, the Party, eager to scrub
   clean its public face, drove him out of the country. Rose ended his days
   in Warsaw, Poland, an unhappy witness to the rise of Solidarity and the
   collapse of the Leninist vision he'd lived by.},

Title = {Varieties of corona news: a cross-national study on the foundations of
   online misinformation production during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 13},
Abstract = {Misinformation in the media is produced by hard-to-gauge thought
   mechanisms employed by individuals or collectivities. In this paper, we
   shed light on what the country-specific factors of falsehood production
   in the context of COVID-19 Pandemic might be. Collecting our evidence
   from the largest misinformation dataset used in the COVID-19
   misinformation literature with close to 11,000 pieces of falsehood, we
   explore patterns of misinformation production by employing a variety of
   methodological tools including algorithms for text similarity,
   clustering, network distances, and other statistical tools. Covering
   news produced in a span of more than 14 months, our paper also
   differentiates itself by its use of carefully controlled hand-labeling
   of topics of falsehood. Findings suggest that country-level factors do
   not provide the strongest support for predicting outcomes of falsehood,
   except for one phenomenon: in countries with serious press freedom
   problems and low human development, the mostly unknown authors of
   misinformation tend to focus on similar content. In addition, the
   intensity of discussion on animals, predictions and symptoms as part of
   fake news is the biggest differentiator between nations; whereas news on
   conspiracies, medical equipment and risk factors offer the least
   explanation to differentiate. Based on those findings, we discuss some
   distinct public health and communication strategies to dispel
   misinformation in countries with particular characteristics. We also
   emphasize that a global action plan against misinformation is needed
   given the highly globalized nature of the online media environment.},

Title = {Fake News and Epistemic Vice: Combating a Uniquely Noxious Market},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {454-475},
Abstract = {The topic of fake news has received increased attention from
   philosophers since the term became a favorite of politicians. Notably
   missing from the conversation, however, is a discussion of fake news and
   conspiracy theory media as a market. This paper will take as its
   starting point the account of noxious markets put forward by Debra Satz
   and will argue that there is a pro tanto moral reason to restrict the
   market for fake news. Specifically, we begin with Satz's argument that
   restricting a market may be required when (i) that market inhibits
   citizens from being able to stand in an equal relationship with one
   another, and (ii) this problem cannot be solved without such direct
   restrictions. Our own argument then proceeds in three parts: first, we
   argue that the market for fake news fits Satz's description of a noxious
   market; second, we argue against explanations of the proliferation of
   fake news that are couched in terms of `epistemic vice' and likewise
   argue against prescribing critical thinking education as a solution to
   the problem; finally, we conclude that, in the absence of other
   solutions to mitigate the noxious effects of the fake news market, we
   have a pro tanto moral reason to impose restrictions on this market. At
   the end of the paper, we consider one proposal to regulate the fake news
   market, which involves making social media outlets potentially liable in
   civil court for damages caused by the fake news hosted on their
   websites.},

Abstract = {Introduction: In palliative patients, psychological intervention is of
   great importance. In the terminal phase of a disease, treatment no
   longer has any curative effect and life expectancy is less than six
   months. During this phase, several processes and intense emotions are
   present, both for the patient and for the caregivers and their families.
   Objectives: To specify and enumerate the areas of psychological
   importance that must be addressed in order to carry out an adequate
   intervention. Methodology: After reviewing authoritative studies on the
   subject and dealing with these patients clinically, we have synthesized
   those scientific principles that have been proved (or shown to be
   effective, depending on the circumstances) in each of the different
   areas to be explored. Results: We have summarized fourteen areas and
   brought them together under the following labels: Current status,
   Knowledge about the patient's situation and progress, Decisions on the
   degree of information to be disclosed, Possible obstacles to
   information, Conspiracy of silence and reaction(s) to it, Confidence and
   tranquility to express emotions, Feelings of integrity and respect for
   patient autonomy, Possibilities and ability to enjoy themselves,
   Perceived degree of support, Perceived passage of time,Time for oneself
   and time for others, Feelings that arise, Exploring fears and Strategies
   previously used. Conclusions: The literature confirms that exploring
   these factors is of great importance at this stage as the affect quality
   of life and must. therefore, be addressed in therapeutic work.},

Abstract = {When considering the Karelian Isthmus during 1890s-1930s, one should
   keep in mind two politically and socially distinctive periods: the
   Russian one (1890-1917) and the Finnish one (1918-1939).
   At the turn of the twentieth century, the Karelian Isthmus was the
   location for activities typical of a borderland: transnational
   encounters, political conspiracy and smuggling, but it was also a
   playful summer place full of artistic creativity. In particular, the
   ``Northern Riviera{''}, the resort district of Terijoki next to the
   Russian border, was visited by Scandinavians as well as Finns and
   Russians. Intellectuals - writers, painters, architects, actors and
   musicians such as Aleksandr Blok, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Maxim Gorkii,
   Kazimir Malevich, Erik Werenskiold, Fyodor Shaliapin, Akseli
   Gallen-Kallela, Eliel Saarinen and others - escaped from the academic
   milieu to the wilderness of northern forests, rocks and coastal
   landscapes.
   Experiments such as futurism, neo-primitivism, intuitivism, organic art
   and other new trends primarily grew out of the Russian symbolist
   heritage (1880-1910), often parodying it and aspiring to an aesthetic
   revolution. The literary magazine The World of Art (1898-1904) gave
   impetus to the so-called ``Scandinavian boom{''} and notably promoted
   international encounters. The Scandinavians took great interest in the
   bold creativity of the Russian artists, while the Russians were inspired
   by Nordic nature and mythology. After the revolution, the Russian dachas
   on the Isthmus continued to serve as meeting places for Nordic
   modernists and Russian refugee intellectuals.},

Abstract = {In addition to objective climatic data, subjective or social reactions
   can also serve as indicators in the assessment of climatic changes.
   Concerning the Little Ice Age the conception of witchcraft is of
   enormous importance. Weather-making counts among the traditional
   abilities of witches. During the late 14(th) and 15(th) centuries the
   traditional conception of witchcraft was transformed into the idea of a
   great conspiracy of witches, to explain ``unnatural{''} climatic
   phenomena. Because of their dangerous nature, particularly their ability
   to generate hailstorms, the very idea of witches was the subject of
   controversial discussion around 1500. The beginnings of meteorology and
   its emphasis of ``natural{''} reasons in relationship to the development
   of weather must be seen against the background of this demoniacal
   discussion. The resurgence of the Little Ice Age revealed the
   susceptibility of society. Scapegoat reactions may be observed by the
   early 1560s even though climatologists, thus far, have been of the
   opinion that the cooling period did not begin until 1565. Despite
   attempts of containment, such as the calvinistic doctrine of
   predestination, extended witch-hunts took place at the various peaks of
   the Little Ice Age because a part of society held the witches directly
   responsibile for the high frequency of climatic anomalies and the
   impacts thereof. The enormous tensions created in society as a result of
   the persecution of witches demonstrate how dangerous it is to discuss
   climatic change under the aspects of morality.},

Title = {COVID-19 Guidelines Adherence and Vaccine Acceptability Among Pregnant
   Women in Niger Foundation Hospital Enugu, South-Eastern Nigeria: A Mixed
   Method Study},

Abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to determine the acceptability of
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and adherence to the
   preventive protocol among pregnant antenatal attendees in Niger
   Foundations Hospital Enugu, South-Eastern Nigeria.Materials and Methods:
   Using a cross-sectional descriptive survey and in-depth interviews, we
   conducted a mixed method study from June to December 2021. We
   administered a structured questionnaire to 210 pregnant women to assess
   their knowledge and adherence to COVID-19 guidelines and interviewed 25
   individuals. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using SPSS
   v.28 and thematic analysis, respectively.Results: The participants' age
   range was 20-43 years, with a mean of 29.9 (4.8) years. Most individuals
   (81.9\%) had a university degree, 40.5\% were skilled workers, and
   73.3\% had parity 0-1. They identified close contact (87.1\%),
   respiratory distress (96.2\%), and handwashing with soap (96.2\%) as the
   commonest mode of transmission, symptom, and preventive strategy of
   COVID-19, respectively. Older women and individuals with higher parity
   had lower knowledge and adherence to COVID-19 precautions. Most
   participants rejected the vaccines due to fear of the side effects on
   themselves and the fetus.Conclusions: Although there was good adherence
   to COVID-19 protocols among the pregnant women in this study, vaccine
   acceptance/uptake rate was low. Education on vaccine advantages and
   correction of conspiracy theories are recommended.},

Title = {Why do people believe health misinformation and who is at risk? A
   systematic review of individual differences in susceptibility to health
   misinformation},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {314},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rationale: Health misinformation poses a significant threat to public
   health. Understanding why people believe health misinformation and who
   is at risk is crucial for developing effective interventions to reduce
   the harmful impact of misinformation. Approach: We conducted a
   systematic review of published empirical research that examined
   individual differences in susceptibility to health misinformation,
   focusing on the psychological, demographic, and behavioral correlates of
   health misinformation susceptibility. To guide our review on
   psychological correlates, we developed an integrative psychological
   model of susceptibility to health misinformation based on one's ability
   and motivation to reason. Results: We identified 47 publications (61
   empirical studies) that met our criteria. Our review suggests that
   subject knowledge, literacy and numeracy, analytical thinking (vs.
   intuitive thinking), and trust in science confer strong resistance to
   health misinformation, whereas conspiracy thinking, religiosity,
   conservative ideology, and conservative party identification are
   associated with more susceptibility to health misinformation.
   Demographically, older age and higher educational attainment predict
   less susceptibility to health misinformation, whereas racial minority
   status is associated with greater susceptibility. Behaviorally, relying
   on health professionals or scientists as information sources predicts
   less susceptibility to health misinformation, whereas social media use
   is associated with greater susceptibility. Conclusions: Susceptibility
   to health misinformation is driven by multiple psychological processes.
   Interventions for reducing the spread and impact of health
   misinformation should be tailored to the psychological mechanism
   underlying susceptibility to health misinformation. Limited resources
   should be used to support interventions targeted at individuals at risk.},

Abstract = {Medical students are the future caregivers of communities, and therefore
   it is important to rectify their misconceptions about the COVID-19
   vaccine. We aimed to explore the knowledge and attitudes among medical
   students toward the COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia and to compare the
   level of knowledge between preclinical and clinical years. This
   epidemiological cross-sectional study of 1445 (47.3\% were pre-clinical
   and 52.7\% were clinical year) medical students was conducted at various
   universities in Saudi Arabia using a simple random sampling technique.
   The results revealed that 34.3\% students did not know how the Pfizer
   vaccine worked, with a high proportion in preclinical students (69.4\%).
   Almost 37\% of participants thought that one could become infected with
   COVID-19 via the COVID-19 vaccine, and 67.1\% of these students were
   pre-clinical. About 22.6\% of students did not trust COVID-19 vaccine
   information from the health ministry, and the majority of them (79.8\%)
   were pre-clinical. Vaccine hesitancy was shown by about 33.3\% (n = 481)
   of subjects, and surprisingly, almost half of them (48.6\%) thought that
   the COVID-19 vaccine involved conspiracy; the majority of them were
   pre-clinical (97.9\%). The overall response of students indicates a
   significantly lower level of knowledge and increased negative attitudes
   of preclinical students toward the COVID-19 vaccine. However, the vast
   majority of students agreed on the importance of the COVID-19 vaccine to
   decrease the spread of the disease.},

Abstract = {Background: As vaccination is a cornerstone strategy to prevent the
   spread of COVID-19, this study assessed and compared beliefs about and
   barriers to COVID-19 vaccination among the population of three countries
   with different Human Development Index (HDI) scores: Saudi Arabia (very
   high), India (medium), and Sudan (low). Methods: A web-based,
   self-administered structured questionnaire was employed to collect data
   from the three countries. The questionnaire contained three sections
   that measured sociodemographic characteristics, participants' beliefs
   about and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, barriers to receiving
   COVID-19 vaccines, and scenarios in which there is a possibility to take
   a COVID-19 vaccine. Multinomial logistic regression was used to
   determine whether there was an association between the country of the
   participant and their beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines. Results: 972
   responses were collected. The study participants from India were more
   likely to believe in the safety and efficacy of vaccines than those from
   Saudi Arabia or Sudan. Consequently, they reported more willingness to
   get vaccinated to avoid complications from COVID-19. Regarding barriers
   to COVID-19 vaccination, concerns about adverse effects and
   ineffectiveness of vaccines were more common among Saudi participants,
   while concerns about conspiracy were more common among Sudanese
   participants. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was higher in
   countries with a very high to medium Human Development Index, indicating
   greater belief in the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.},

Abstract = {In 1915, the Constitutionalist faction of Venustiano Carranza moved into
   southern Mexico, promising revolutionary justice and retribution against
   The Reaction. Unfamiliar with the social topography of the region,
   Carranza's men depended on information gleaned from dubious sources to
   make key political decisions. Groups competing for the
   Constitutionalists' patronage flooded Carranza's correspondence,
   accentuating their own revolutionary bona fides while exposing their
   enemies. The result was a political milieu of denunciation, and nowhere
   was this milieu more acrimonious than in Juchitan, a coveted
   transportation hub in the isthmus region of Oaxaca. Using the Carranza
   archive in Mexico City, this essay examines denunciations sent from
   Juchitan in early 1915. These letters reveal an unmediated ``popular
   voice,{''} unbound from the public sphere, its code of honor, and its
   recognition of the realm of privacy. The shift of public politics into
   the private sphere had two important consequences. First,
   unsubstantiated information-rumors, gossip-gained a prominent position
   in local politics. Second, it opened the door to political participation
   to marginalized groups, particularly the working classes and women. This
   essay examines two letters in detail, one from an ``honorable worker{''}
   and the other from a prominent woman, both dealing in rumor, gossip, and
   conspiracy. Despite their inherent unreliability, these letters give us
   a window into the construction of the camarilla, prevailing perceptions
   about politics and the accumulation of wealth, and the possibilities and
   limits of women's participation in high politics.},

Abstract = {The search in graph databases for individuals or entities undertaking
   latent or emergent behaviors has applicability in the areas of homeland
   security, consumer analytics, behavioral health, and cybersecurity. In
   this setting, even partial matches to hypothesized indicators are worthy
   of further investigation, and analysts in these domains aim to identify
   and maintain awareness of entities that either fully or partially match
   the queried attributes over time. We provide a comprehensive version of
   a graph pattern matching technique called Investigative Search for Graph
   Trajectories (INSiGHT) to find emergent patterns of behaviors in
   networks and tailor the application to detecting radicalization in the
   homeland security domain. To enable analysts'; accounting of recurring
   behavioral indicators and the recency of behaviors as the imminence of a
   threat, we provide parameterized methods to score multiple occurrences
   of indicators and to dampen the significance of indicators over time,
   respectively. Additionally, we provide an indicator categorization
   scheme and a match filtering technique to ensure that partial matches to
   the most salient indicators are identified while reducing the number of
   false positives. Furthermore, since individuals may be radicalized in
   small groups or be involved in collective terrorist plots, we introduce
   a non-combinatorial neighborhood matching technique that enables
   analysts to use INSiGHT to identify potential query matches from
   clusters of individuals who may be operating in conspiracies. We
   demonstrate the performance of our approach using a synthetic
   radicalization data set and a large, real-world data set of the
   BlogCatalog social network.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The anti-vaccination movement was an ongoing issue in Malaysia, a
   Muslim-majority country, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. It is
   unclear whether the introduction of new COVID-19 vaccines would
   similarly provoke anti-vaccine sentiments. This study analyzed COVID-19
   anti-vaccine sentiments in the Malaysian community. Anti-vaccine
   comments from Facebook page posts were extracted. The qualitative
   software QSR-NVivo 10 was used to manage, code and analyze the data. The
   fast-track COVID-19 vaccine evoked the fear of unknown long-term
   effects, safety, effectiveness and the duration of protection. The halal
   status of the COVID-19 vaccines is important. Although it is permissible
   to use vaccines that are not certified halal under the state of darurah
   (emergency), there was doubt that the current state has reached the
   stage of darurah that warrants the use of vaccines. COVID-19 vaccine
   microchip conspiracy theories were raised. COVID-19 is viewed as only
   severe for vulnerable populations, and hence vaccination is not needed
   for the healthy. There were opinions that coronavirus treatments would
   be more beneficial than vaccination. The anti-COVID-19 vaccine
   sentiments uncovered in this study provide important insights for the
   formulation of public health messages to instill confidence in new
   COVID-19 vaccines. Despite the pandemic being nearly over and many
   people worldwide having received COVID-19 vaccines, the findings provide
   important insight into potential issues regarding the introduction of
   new vaccines in the event of future pandemics.},

Title = {MAGNA CARTA AND THE AMERICAN POLITICAL IMAGINATION: TWO INSTANCES OF
   HABEAS CORPUS VINDICATED},
Journal = {FRONTIERS OF LAW IN CHINA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {215-235},
Abstract = {Magna Carta has long been understood as a source of inspiration for the
   U.S. Constitution, and especially its enshrinement of the writ of habeas
   corpus - the right of any prisoner to test his or her detention
   according to the law. In the ``Suspension Clause{''} of the U.S.
   Constitution (Article I, Section 8), Congress is granted permission to
   suspend habeas corpus only ``when in cases of Rebellion or Invasion the
   public Safety may require it.{''} This article surveys two failed
   attempts by the U.S. government to suspend the writ of habeas corpus.
   The first (which was actually the very first such attempt) was in 1807
   and followed revelations of the so-called Burr Conspiracy. The second
   (incidentally the most recent in American history) occurred during the
   War on Terror and culminated with the Supreme Court's decision of
   Boumediene vs Bush in 2008. A close examination of these two historical
   episodes reveals just how different were the constitutional processes of
   the early republic and contemporary times. Additionally, comparing the
   uses of Magna Carta during the two episodes demonstrates marked changes
   in American political culture. Historical consciousness, vital to early
   Americans' understanding of their political system, has shifted to an
   elite level. Likewise, the protection of fundamental liberties has
   migrated from the popular branch of government (Congress) to the elite
   one (the Supreme Court). This article considers the implication of this
   shift in both constitutional processes and historical consciousness.},

Number = {3-4},
Pages = {441-461},
Abstract = {The article addresses cultural memory in the Netherlands and Indonesia
   about mass violence committed during Dutch colonialism in the nineteenth
   and twentieth century. In both cases it questions the conception,
   expressed by various observers of both countries, that colonial violence
   has been forgotten in the sense that there are no traces of it left in
   the public sphere. In the case of the Netherlands, it is argued that
   colonial violence is again and again experienced as `absent' because of
   issues with what I will call its `memorability': the degree to which a
   past is memorable, easy to remember within certain frames of
   remembrance. Using Ann Laura Stoler's notion of `cultural aphasia',
   which indicates a lack of language in a culture to address certain
   issues, I argue that traces of colonial violence are widely present in
   the Netherlands, but that there is a difficulty to give them a meaning
   within a national framework. With this analysis, I depart from an
   intentionalist perspective on cultural memory in which there are
   specific groups in society that through conspiracies create a cover-up
   of colonialism, and I want to show that in fact the victims of Dutch
   colonialism are not memorable within the mnemonic community of the
   Netherlands because dominant discourses do not produce them as belonging
   to Dutch national history. In the Indonesian case, with a special focus
   on Aceh, it is argued that far from being absent, memory of colonial
   violence is highly contested.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe experiences of UK ethnic minority (UKEM) healthcare
   workers are crucial to ameliorating the disproportionate COVID-19
   infection rate and outcomes in the UKEM community. We conducted a
   qualitative study on UKEM healthcare workers' perspectives on COVID-19
   vaccine hesitancy (CVH) in the UKEM community. MethodsParticipants were
   15 UKEM healthcare workers (11 females; age range: 26-58 {[}43.3 +/-
   9.4] years). Data were collected using individual and joint interviews,
   and a focus group, and analyzed using thematic analysis. ResultsWe
   generated three themes: heterogeneity (two subthemes), mistrust (six
   subthemes), and mitigating (six subthemes). Therein, participants
   distinguished CVH in the UKEM community in educational attainment and
   ethnicity. They pointed to the role of mistrust in CVH in the UKEM
   community. They opined that the mistrust underlying CVH in the UKEM
   community is rooted in history and religion, conspiracy theories, the
   speedy development and novelty of the vaccines, post-vaccination
   complications/side effects, false positive test results, and social
   media and social support/influence. Participants recommended that
   interventions targeted at mitigating CVH in the UKEM community need to,
   in a non-judgmental way, tackle dis/misinformation and provide
   education, and incorporate UKEM healthcare worker endorsement. They also
   suggested such interventions be community-oriented, enhance the
   convenience of vaccination centers and the possibility of vaccine
   choice, and appreciate that overcoming CVH and accepting vaccination is
   a gradual process involving personal assessment of risks and benefits.
   ConclusionCVH in the UKEM community is a multifaceted phenomenon
   requiring multicomponent interventions.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPsychosis spectrum disorder is a heterogeneous, multifactorial
   clinical phenotype, known to have a high heritability, only a minor
   portion of which can be explained by molecular measures of genetic
   variation. This study proposes that the identification of genetic
   variation underlying psychotic disorder may have suffered due to issues
   in the psychometric conceptualization of the phenotype. Here we aim to
   open a new line of research into the genetics of mental disorders by
   explicitly incorporating genes into symptom networks. Specifically, we
   investigate whether links between a polygenic risk score (PRS) for
   schizophrenia and measures of psychosis proneness can be identified in a
   network model.MethodsWe analyzed data from n = 2180 subjects (controls,
   patients diagnosed with a non-affective psychotic disorder, and the
   first-degree relatives of the patients). A network structure was
   computed to examine associations between the 42 symptoms of the
   Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE) and the PRS for
   schizophrenia.ResultsThe resulting network shows that the PRS is
   directly connected to the spectrum of positive and depressive symptoms,
   with the items conspiracy and no future being more often located on
   predictive pathways from PRS to other symptoms.ConclusionsTo our
   knowledge, the current exploratory study provides a first application of
   the network framework to the field of behavior genetics research. This
   allows for a novel outlook on the investigation of the relations between
   genome-wide association study-based PRSs and symptoms of mental
   disorders, by focusing on the dependencies among variables.},

Abstract = {Copyright owners can trace online violations to an infringer's Internet
   protocol address but cannot identify her unless they obtain court
   approval to serve a subpoena on an Internet service provider. As the
   most popular peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol today, Bit Torrent
   requires users to share files with each other in a conspiracy-like
   fashion. By arguing that this feature imparts a ``same transaction{''}
   character to Bit Torrent infringement activities, a copyright owner can
   seek to join multitudes of Internet protocol addresses as John Doe
   defendants in an application for early discovery. Courts are divided as
   to whether early discovery should be granted where tens, hundreds, or
   sometimes thousands of Internet protocol addresses are joined together
   in one case. Many in the Internet user community fault copyright owners
   for using the courts as a mere instrument to seek identification
   information en masse as part of a coercive practice to induce monetary
   settlements. This Note examines how case law relating to early discovery
   and civil procedure joinder rules applies to multiple defendants
   allegedly participating in a ``same transaction{''} that occurs solely
   within the inner workings of a file-sharing protocol. Even if BitTorrent
   usage legally supports joinder, this Note highlights the difficult
   balance between the right to enforce a copyright and the rights of
   Internet users to be free from litigation threats. Without a legislative
   response that is resilient in the face of an ever-changing technology,
   copyright infringement problems will continue to inundate our courts.},

Abstract = {Widespread population vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a
   matter of great interest to public health as it is the main
   pharmacological measure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Hesitancy/reluctance to vaccination has become a main barrier to
   containing the pandemic. Young adults are the age group with the
   greatest resistance to vaccination, even in countries with the highest
   vaccination rates during this pandemic. The objective of this study was
   to identify the main predictive factors of vaccination intention and
   profile people with hesitancy/reluctance to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2
   virus in young adults living in Spain during the pandemic. A
   cross-sectional study was conducted based on the administration of an
   online survey (PSY-COVID-2) that evaluated the intention of vaccination
   together with a wide range of sociodemographic, social, cognitive,
   behavioral and affective variables in a sample of 2210 young adults.
   14\% of the sample showed hesitancy/reluctance to vaccination at the
   beginning of their vaccination campaign. A total of 35 factors were
   associated (small to medium effect sizes) with the intention to get
   vaccinated. A reduced set of 4 attitudinal and social variables
   explained 41\% of the variability in vaccination intention: attitude to
   the vaccination, trust in health staff/scientists, conspiracy beliefs
   about SARS-CoV-2 and time spent being informed about COVID-19. These
   variables showed good sensitivity/specificity for classifying people as
   reluctant/not reluctant to vaccination, properly classifying},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {The recent indictment of more than 40 individuals and entities in the
   FIFA corruption scandal demonstrates the expansive reach of the federal
   criminal law, raising important questions of extraterritorial
   jurisdiction and substantive law. This article argues that the existing
   law is sufficient to capture pervasive corruption in international
   organizations like Federation Internationale de Football Association
   (FIFA) when their transactions reach domestic wires in the financial
   system. The principal charge in the FIFA case, for example, falls under
   the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). But the
   extraterritorial application of RICO is far from settled law, and the
   dramatic scale of the racketeering conspiracy will have profound
   implications for the substantive law, presenting problems of legal
   specification and challenging the transactional model of crime. One of
   the indictment's predicate offenses, moreover, is a novel honest
   services fraud charge that implicates the very nature of fiduciary
   duties in the international marketplace. This article suggests that the
   law should extend fiduciary protections against commercial bribery in
   the international sphere so long as the values underlying those
   protections accord with collectively shared norms. Finally, this article
   advances a conceptual understanding, informed by theories of global
   governance and development, of why the law should countenance
   international corruption. Federal prosecutors are becoming increasingly
   concerned with the integrity of globally integrated markets, and global
   prosecutions may carry the potential to strengthen deterrence, policy
   cohesion among decentralized stakeholders, and reinforce international
   norms of conduct.},

Abstract = {The decentralized participatory architecture of the Internet challenges
   traditional knowledge authorities and hierarchies. Questions arise about
   whether lay inclusion helps to democratize' knowledge formation or if
   existing hierarchies are re-enacted online. This article focuses on
   Wikipedia, a much-celebrated example which gives an in-depth picture of
   the process of knowledge production in an open environment. Drawing on
   insights from the sociology of knowledge, Wikipedia's talk pages are
   conceptualized as an arena where reality is socially constructed. Using
   grounded theory, this article examines the entry for the September 11
   attacks and its related talk pages in the German Wikipedia. Numerous
   alternative interpretations (labeled as conspiracy theories') that
   fundamentally contradict the account of established knowledge
   authorities regarding this event have emerged. On the talk pages, these
   views collide, thereby serving as a useful case study to examine the
   role of experts and lay participants in the process of knowledge
   construction on Wikipedia. The study asks how the parties negotiate what
   actually happened' and which knowledges should be represented in the
   Wikipedia entry. The conflicting points of view overload the discursive
   capacity of the contributors. The community reacts by marginalizing
   opposing knowledge and protecting or immunizing the article against
   these disparate views. This is achieved by rigorously excluding
   knowledge which is not verified by external expert authorities.
   Therefore, in this case, lay participation did not lead to a
   democratization' of knowledge production, but rather re-enacted
   established hierarchies.},

Title = {The Discursive Construction of the 1978-1979 Iranian Revolution in the

Abstract = {This article examines the discursive construction of the 19781979 social
   movement that ultimately became the Iranian Revolution, as constructed
   through the discourse of the charismatic leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
   Khomeini. This article illustrates that Khomeini was able to
   strategically co-opt the Shiite symbolism of the Battle of Karbala to
   bring together the most unlikely of bedfellows to unite in one common
   opposition movement. We first provide a summary of the socio-political
   events that contextualised Khomeini's discourse and then examine two
   commemorative declarations given by Khomeini in the key months before
   the overthrow of the Pahlavi regime. We will illustrate, via a
   discourse-historical analysis, that the two primary narratives prominent
   in Khomeini's discourse are as follows: (i) the continuation of the
   Battle of Karbala and (ii) the idea of a foreign conspiracy and a
   dangerous foreign other. We will also describe various discursive
   strategies that rendered Khomeini's discourse purposefully vague enough
   to appeal to Iran's fragmented opposition. Although the conspiratorial
   appeal of Khomeini's speeches has been discussed in the literature, we
   seek to show that it is the co-opting of a national myth in an
   all-encompassing language that drives the mass appeal of the discourse.
   The methods described in this study can be utilised by social and
   community psychologists seeking to understand how political actors
   discursively construct history in such a way as to serve their political
   ends. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Number = {8},
Pages = {272-289},
Abstract = {The problem of migration of the Irish military to the European continent
   in modern times is examined in the article. Particular attention is paid
   to their role, political attitudes and adaptation in host societies. The
   relevance of the study is due to insufficient knowledge of the specifics
   of the Irish military migration of the 18th century and the degree to
   which Jacobite ideology influenced the political mood of Irish people in
   Europe. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that the study of
   the mass migration of the Irish military to Europe in the period between
   the Treaty of Limerick in 1691 and the end of the War of Austrian
   Succession in 1748 will complement the Irish military history of modern
   times. The study of personal correspondence, memoirs and literary works
   allows a deeper study of the issues of identity, ideology and collective
   memory of the Irish military, to determine the degree of participation
   of the Irish in various dynastic wars and conspiracies in Europe in the
   XVIII century, to restore some details from the life of the Irish
   Jacobites, conspirators, spies and social networks migrants. Analysis of
   various sources has led to a rethinking of the situation of the Irish
   diaspora in France and Spain. It was found that through an extensive
   migration network, the Irish Jacobites communicated with the world
   community of Irish-in-exile, posing a threat to the Hanoverian
   government.},

Journal = {SEXUAL HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Pages = {469-476},
Abstract = {Background Transgender women living with HIV infection experience poorer
   health outcomes across the HIV continuum of care. While disparities are
   well established, their underlying mechanisms are not well understood.
   This study examined the HIV continuum of care (also known as the HIV
   treatment cascade), including linkage and engagement in care and health
   status among transgender women and cisgender women and cisgender men
   living with HIV. Method: Case-control matching was applied to a cohort
   of 1101 people living with HIV; 70 transgender women living with HIV
   were matched on years since testing HIV positive with cisgender women
   and cisgender men. Participants provided measures indicative of the HIV
   treatment cascade that included linkage and engagement in care,
   receiving and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and HIV viral
   suppression. Common correlates of HIV-related health status: depression
   symptoms, HIV-related stress, alcohol and drug use, healthcare
   conspiracy beliefs, medical mistrust, emotional social support and
   tangible social support, were also assessed. Results: Transgender women
   were significantly less likely to receive ART, were less adherent to ART
   and had poorer HIV viral suppression than cisgender persons.
   Multivariable models demonstrated that health disparities were predicted
   by transgender women having poorer tangible social support over and
   above the other correlates of health outcomes. Conclusion: Tangible
   support is amenable by interventions such as building and strengthening
   supportive networks and paraprofessional services. Socially supportive
   interventions should be considered critical in efforts to decrease HIV
   health disparities among transgender women.},

Abstract = {Andrea Doria (1466-1560) and later his heir, Giovanni Andrea I
   (1540-1606), were ``generals of the sea{''} for the Spanish crown, and
   in that capacity engaged in a long-term effort to contain and defeat the
   Ottoman enemies. Ariosto, in his Orlando Furioso, celebrated Andrea as a
   new and greater Pompey, who made the Mediterranean safe from the
   ``pirates{''} in its every part, and many other contemporary authors
   exalted his feats against the Turks. This paper aims to investigate how
   this role translated into images, with reference to Andrea, but also to
   his second-in-command and designated heir Giannettino (who was killed in
   the 1547 Fieschi conspiracy), and to the latter's son Giovanni Andrea,
   who, because of his father's premature death, became Andrea's successor.
   Works of art commissioned by the Dorias include references to Turks in
   such diverse contexts as ``all'antica{''} sculptures and plaquettes, the
   depiction of the Battle of Lepanto in a narratively articulated series
   of six large tapestries, and the celebration of the passage of power
   from Andrea to Giovanni Andrea in a complex allegorical composition. The
   approach of the two Dorias to the theme was different: mediated by
   classical references in the case of the emperor's admiral, more explicit
   in that of his heir. The earliest, most direct representation of the
   defeated Turks at Andrea's feet, however, originated outside the family
   patronage, in the context of the public commission of an honorific
   portrait statue.},

Abstract = {This article examines the workings of the grapevine, which appears at
   times of uncertainty and is more effective and faster than the formal
   communication channels, and rumor -which is the main element of this
   type of communication- by looking at forum sections on the web sites of
   several newspapers in the Turkish mass media. It has analyzed readers'
   comments on forum pages beneath news about swine flu in the issues of
   daily Milliyet, Haberturk, Sabah and Radikal between 14 October and 24
   October 2009, using the thematic analysis method.
   Rumor, the main element of the grapevine, emerges as a result of
   insufficient information flow, lack of trust in the society, and the
   circulation of contradictory news. This article aims at understanding
   how the grapevine works by examining rumors about the swine flu that
   emerged as a result of lack of information as well as for the reasons
   mentioned above. We have observed that rumors about the swine flu
   revolve around five themes: Criticism of the government, health,
   economy, conspiracy theories, and the religious aspect. The evaluation
   of the data we collected has revealed that the lack of information
   disclosure by the government authorities concerning the location and the
   frequency of the swine flu cases and concerning the swine flu
   vaccination has led to a lack of trust in the society and to rumors.
   This article shows how the grapevine operates in this kind of
   environment.},

Abstract = {Experimental analyses of decay in a tunicate deuterostome and three
   lophotrochozoans indicate that the controls on decay and preservation of
   embryos, identified previously based on echinoids, are more generally
   applicable. Four stages of decay are identified regardless of the
   environment of death and decay. Embryos decay rapidly in oxic and anoxic
   conditions, although the gross morphology of embryos is maintained for
   longer under anoxic conditions. Under anoxic reducing conditions, the
   gross morphology of the embryos is maintained for the longest period of
   time, compatible with the timescale required for bacterially mediated
   mineralization of soft tissues. All four stages of decay were
   encountered under all environmental conditions, matching the spectrum of
   preservational qualities encountered in all fossil embryo assemblages.
   The preservation potential of embryos of deuterostomes and
   lophotrochozoans is at odds with the lack of such embryos in the fossil
   record. Rather, the fossil record of embryos, as sparse as it is, is
   dominated by forms interpreted as ecdysozoans, cnidarians, and
   stem-metazoans. The dearth of deuterostome and lophotrochozoan embryos
   may be explained by the fact that ecdysozoans, at least, tend to deposit
   their eggs in the sediment rather than through broadcast spawning.
   However, fossil embryos remain very rare and the main controlling factor
   on their fossilization may be the unique conspiracy of environmental
   conditions at a couple of sites. The preponderance of fossilized embryos
   of direct developers should not be used in evidence against the
   existence of indirect development at this time in animal evolutionary
   history.},

Abstract = {This international conference, organised by Teesside University in
   conjunction with the University of Cambridge (John Pollard), offered a
   variety of perspectives on leading fascist and far-right ideologues over
   the course of the twentieth (and into the twenty-first) century.
   Focusing upon the historical impact and contemporary influence of key
   far-right figures and intellectual trends (such as transnationalism and
   meta-politics), the conference brought together speakers over two days
   of academic discussion. The conference served several purposes: to
   examine the continuities and changes in fascist ideology; to present a
   report on the turn to online anti-Muslim hate by the contemporary far
   right in Britain; and to mark the formal launch of a new Centre for
   Fascist, Anti-Fascist and Post-Fascist Studies (CFAPS) based at Teesside
   University.},

Title = {Empowering the People's Truth Through Social Media? (De)Legitimizing
   Truth Claims of Populist Politicians and Citizens},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {210-219},
Abstract = {Right-wing populists have allegedly fueled increasing levels of distrust
   regarding expert knowledge and empirical evidence. Yet, we know little
   about how right-wing populist politicians and citizens use social media
   to construct and oppose truth claims. Using a qualitative analysis of
   Twitter and Facebook posts communicated by right-wing populists and
   citizens supporting populist ideas in the Netherlands, this article
   offers in-depth insights into processes of legitimization (confirming
   truth claims) and de-legitimization (opposing truth claims). The main
   conclusion is that right-wing populists and citizens supporting populism
   do not share a universal way of referring to reality. They use social
   media to communicate a confirmation-biased reality: Expert knowledge and
   evidence are de-contextualized or reinterpreted and aligned with
   rightwing populist agendas. References to the people's experiences and
   worldviews, conspiracy theories and crisis sentiments are used to
   legitimize people's opposition to expert knowledge and empirical
   evidence. Based on these findings, we coin the idea of an ``adaptable
   construction of confirmation-biased truth claims{''} central in
   right-wing populist interpretations of reality. In times of increasing
   attacks on expert knowledge and empirical evidence, populist discourse
   may fuel an antagonism between the ordinary people's experiences and the
   truth claims of established media channels and politicians in
   government. Social media offer a platform to members of the public to
   engage in discussions about (un)truthfulness, perceived deception, and
   populist oppositions-potentially amplifying divides between the ordinary
   people's experiences and expert sources.},

Abstract = {How can we detect Early Modern English semantic deviation, which Manfred
   Gorlach describes as ``a difficult and largely unsolved problem for the
   history of the English lexicon{''}? Lexical and phrasal neologisms stand
   out from the simplest word-lists, but readers must understand the
   meaning of words in context before recognizing semantic drift. New
   diachronic corpora such as Early English Books Online (EEBO) and
   Lexicons of Early Modern English (LEME), two web-based corpora, could
   help, were their vocabulary to be lemmatized and associated with
   specific senses in the Oxford English Dictionary. Only LEME tries to do
   so, however, and its more than half a million word-entries are not
   uniformly analyzed yet. Three instances of semantic deviation in
   Shakespeare's plays serve to illustrate the challenge: the
   ``pricking{''} of a witch's thumb in Macbeth (a means of torture), the
   villain's name ``Aron{''} in Titus Andronicus (a new starch obtained
   from a weed of that name), and the term ``acting{''} (for
   ``enacting{''}) as used by Brutus in describing his dream of a
   conspiracy to assassinate Caesar. Because these innovative senses are
   undocumented in this period, because no monolingual English dictionaries
   survive from it, and because these instances of drift disappeared soon
   afterwards, they are hard to find. Manfred Gorlach's problem will remain
   in force for some time to come if we have to rely on literary text
   analysis to locate semantic deviation.},

Journal = {COMPUTER},

Pages = {50+},

Abstract = {Concern about national security has increased significantly since the
   terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. The CIA, FBI, and other federal
   agencies are actively collecting domestic and foreign intelligence to
   prevent future attacks. These efforts have in turn motivated local
   authorities to more closely monitor criminal activities in their own
   jurisdictions.
   A major challenge facing all law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering
   organizations is accurately and efficiently analyzing the growing
   volumes of crime data. For example, complex conspiracies are often
   difficult to unravel because information on suspects can be
   geographically diffuse and span long periods of time. Detecting
   cybercrime can likewise be difficult because busy network traffic and
   frequent online transactions generate large amounts of data, only a
   small portion of which relates to illegal activities.
   Data mining is a powerful tool that enables criminal investigators who
   may lack extensive training as data analysts to explore large databases
   quickly and efficiently.(1) Computers can process thousands of
   instructions in seconds, saving precious time. In addition, installing
   and running software often costs less than hiring and training
   personnel. Computers are also less prone to errors than human
   investigators, especially those who work long hours.
   We present a general framework for crime data mining that draws on
   experience gained with the Coplink project
   (http://ai.bpa.arizona.edu/coplink), which researchers at the University
   of Arizona have been conducting in collaboration with the Tucson and
   Phoenix police departments since 1997.},

Abstract = {The paper considers the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the behavior
   of militants of illegal armed groups and the population in the
   militant-controlled territories. The study was conducted on the example
   of the territories of self-proclaimed ``L/DPR{''} within Donbass
   (Eastern Ukraine) in the period March-May 2020. Based on the analysis of
   social networks and media, the main narratives related to the perception
   of threats of epidemic were identified and analyzed. Its prevalence and
   dynamics among the militants and population in comparison with radical
   groups and population of Ukraine was analyzed. The main types of moods
   and emotions that were associated with the perception of epidemic were
   identified. The management decisions of the ``L/DPR{''} leaders during
   the epidemic were analyzed. It was found that the measures of militant
   ``authorities{''} were not aimed at protecting population but at social
   management - channeling aggression and constructing propaganda.},

Title = {Moralization of E-cigarette Use and Regulation: A Mixed-Method
   Computational Analysis of Opinion Polarization},
Journal = {HEALTH COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {E-cigarette use, or vaping, is undergoing a process of moralization in
   which issues about vaping evolve from being morally neutral to having
   discernible moral implications. Using Moral Foundations Theory, this
   study compared the moral narratives underlying polarized views about
   e-cigarette use and regulation. We integrated computational and human
   strategies by conducting the Chow test on the time series data and
   classification, topic modeling, and Chi-square tests on posts (N =
   2,669) from 26 pro-vaping and 19 anti-vaping Facebook Pages. The
   observation period (August 1, 2019 to March 5, 2020) encompassed the
   outbreak of ``e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung
   injury{''} (EVALI), deaths and subsequent legislation. Results revealed
   that pro-vaping posts were more likely than anti-vaping posts to mention
   Fairness/cheating and Authority/subversion, involving a conspiracy
   belief in an ``e-cigarettes vs. Big Tobacco{''} rivalry, while
   anti-vaping posts were more likely to mention Sanctity/degradation.
   There were no significant differences between pro-vaping and anti-vaping
   posts in the likelihood of mentioning Care/harm or Loyalty/betrayal.
   Nevertheless, according to the topic modeling results, the use of moral
   foundations varied between pro-vaping and anti-vaping narratives, with
   the meanings of Care/harm and Loyalty/betrayal dependent on the post
   author's group affiliation. Health interventions can tailor persuasive
   messages to different moral values and debunk misinformation about
   public health policies to mitigate the vaping epidemic. Theoretical
   implications are also discussed.},

Title = {COVID-19 and vaccination: analysis of public institution's role in
   information spread through Twitter},
Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE SALUD PUBLICA},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a time where social media
   allows increased conversations about it. These conversations have spread
   various conspiracies about vaccines against COVID-19. It is, therefore,
   necessary to develop communication strategies, led by official accounts,
   that offer accessible information on vaccination as a preventive public
   health strategy. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of public
   institutions on Twitter campaign \#yomevacuno to deal with
   misinformation about vaccination against COVID-19.
   Methods: This paper performs a social network analysis and content
   analysis of Twitter data, using NodeXL software, from December 8th to
   23rd, 2020. Tweets included content \#yomevacuno hashtag.
   Results: A total of 6,080 interactions were collected, 82\% were tweets.
   Data shows that public institutions generate 53.36\% of traffic
   information, the most important was the Ministerio de Sanidad from
   Spain. Content analysis revealed that 48\% of a sample of 50 Tweets the
   message was focused on vaccination as a social responsibility to defeat
   COVID-19 pandemic.
   Conclusions: The communication strategy of \#yomevacuno hashtag, has
   been led by the Ministerio de Sanidad of Spain, by comparison to other
   campaigns in which there was no large presence of public institutions.
   This case represents the importance of social media as a way to spread
   information and prevention, even in public health and the need for them
   to be led by public organizations rather than by individual users.},

   Overview},
Journal = {NAUCHNYI DIALOG},
Year = {2021},
Number = {6},
Pages = {9-28},
Abstract = {The semantic-motivational and etymological analysis of the Russian
   dialectal designations of lumbar and lumbar pain is presented. The
   material was extracted from dictionaries of Russian dialects, from
   unpublished card files of the Ural University toponymic expedition to
   the territories of the Russian North and the Upper Volga region, as well
   as folklore and ethnographic sources related to folk medicine. The main
   semantic-motivational models underlying the designation of the lower
   back, which can reflect the idea of the ``topography{''} of this part of
   the body, correlation with adjacent bodily areas, the functions of the
   lower back. and pain symptoms are considered. It is noted that in the
   ``lumbar{''} vocabulary the main place belongs to the names of lumbar
   pain, the abundance of which is determined by the nature of agricultural
   labor. It has been shown that several names contain an indication of the
   localization of pain, but in most cases the nature of the pain is
   conveyed - cutting, stabbing, aching, etc. The authors analyze
   linguistic material in combination with folklore and ethnographic: texts
   of conspiracies, ritual dialogues, descriptions of magical healing
   practices. Sign complexes are identified, within which the designations
   of pain symptoms are projected onto methods, means and tools of
   treatment. In such complexes, the principle of etymological magic can be
   realized, consistent with the concept of the ``witchcraft{''} origin of
   pain symptoms. Motivational and etymological solutions for dark words
   are proposed.},

Title = {The hydroxychloroquine alliance: how far-right leaders and alt-science
   preachers came together to promote a miracle drug},
Journal = {REVISTA DE ADMINISTRACAO PUBLICA},

Abstract = {Soon after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world saw far-
   right leaders uniting to promote hydroxychloroquine despite
   controversial results. Why have some leaders actively promoted the drug
   since then, contradicting recommendations made by their own government's
   health authorities? Our argument is twofold. First, hydroxychloroquine
   has been an integral tool of medical populist performance in the context
   of the COVID-19 pandemic. We adopt Lasco \& Curato's (2018) definition
   of medical populism as a political style based on performances of public
   health crises that pit `the people' against `the establishment' using
   alternative knowledge claims to cast doubt on the credibility of
   doctors, scientists, and technocrats. Second, rather than being an
   individual endeavor, medical populism addressing the coronavirus crisis
   has led populists to build an alt-science network. We define it as a
   loose movement of alleged truth-seekers who publicly advance scientific
   claims at a crossroads between partial evidence, pseudo-science, and
   conspiracy theories. It comprises scientists, businesspeople and
   celebrities united by their distrust of governments and mainstream
   science. In this article, we look at how the hydroxychloroquine alliance
   was formed, as well as its political and policy implications. To this
   end, we compare why and how Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro have
   appealed to medical populist performances when addressing the health
   crisis. By mobilizing the concepts of medical populism and alt-science,
   this paper aims to contribute to the scholarship on the relationship
   between populist politics and policy-making.},

Title = {Oronyms of Monsalvat and Valhalla in Dramaturgy of Wagner's New Myth
   ``Lohengrin{''}},
Journal = {RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {The paper deals with the following elaboration levels of opera myth in
   Wagner's ``Lohengrin{''}: the semantic functions of the Monsalvat and
   Valhalla oronyms, concentric dramaturgy as a sign of the reverse time of
   the chronotope-sacra. The research is based on the principles of
   mythooperology, musical onomatology, encyclopedic, intro- and
   extra-myphological types of analysis - scientific fields of musicology
   and methodological principles developed by the author of this paper.
   Valhalla and Monsalvat fulfilled at different times the similar
   functions (world resurrection mountain, castle, dwelling of heavenly
   warriors of light), which gave the sacred oronyms meaning of semantic
   twins in R. Wagner's opera. ``Lohengrin{''} opera transmythology, which
   takes place in the era of destroyed Klingsor, is based on a
   confrontation between Wunder and Zauber, a duel for the rule over
   Brabant (Midgard). Four large circles (the circle of Monsalvat, the
   narrative circle, the circle of Dei Judicium, the vow circle), two small
   circles, two transitional or intermediate circles (conspiracy and
   Valhalla) structure the content of the musical-scenic whole. The sacral
   centre of the opera myth is interpreted through scenes 4 and 5 act 2,
   where the conflictive opposition between Valhalla and Monsalvat acquires
   public form. According to the doctrine of ``transcendental
   philosophers{''}, R. Wagner's new opera myth acquires the value of a
   fragmentary formed encyclopaedia-chaos, which is dominated by the rigid
   logic of artistic form design with the pattern of freedom.},

Title = {COVID-19 Rumor Detection Using Psycho-Linguistic Features},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {117530-117543},
Abstract = {During the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, the social media was flooded with
   misinformation. Irrespective of the type of the misinformation, such
   contents played a significant role in increasing confusion among people
   in the middle of an ongoing crisis. The purpose of the study is to
   investigate the nature of a specific type of misinformation, i.e.,
   rumors, surrounding COVID-19. The study utilizes a publicly available
   and labelled Twitter dataset and proposes a novel feature space, which
   can detect rumor instances with high accuracy. The proposed feature
   space not only includes content-based features, but also includes
   psycho-linguistic features to further study the characteristics of the
   content from the perspectives of linguistics and psychology. The use of
   psycho-linguistic features has been utilised to understand certain
   dramatisation of text in the domain of conspiracy propagation and fake
   news detection. However, the use of such dramatisation detection
   approach has never been used for the purposes of rumor detection. Our
   study first outlines the differences between these categories of
   misinformation propagation and clarifies where rumor fits-in under the
   broader umbrella of misinformation. It further outlines how the use of
   psycho-linguistic features can also improve the detection accuracy of
   rumors on social media. The study demonstrates through multiple
   experimental setups that psycho-linguistic features improves the
   detection accuracy and associated performance measures, such as
   precision and recall, for COVID-19 rumors on Twitter. The observed
   improvements are consistent across multiple machine learning models.},

Title = {`Mobile Phones and the Internet, Mate': (Social) Media, Art, and
   Revolution in Omar Robert Hamilton's <i>The City Always Wins</i>},
Journal = {HUMANITIES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In his novel about the Egyptian Revolution, The City Always Wins (2017),
   Omar Robert Hamilton shows that the alternative media possess mass
   engagement and global reach, while threatening power. However, over the
   course of his novel Hamilton traces the crushing of the `Twitter
   revolution' and the rise of a disillusionment and despair among the
   revolutionaries. This downward trajectory is typified both in the
   appellative journey from Hamilton's non-profit media collective
   Mosireen-'those who insist'-to the novel's similar group, portentously
   named Chaos; and in the text's reverse-chronological structure of
   `Tomorrow', `Today', and `Yesterday'. The author uses Twitter as an
   archive of an alternative, resistant history of revolutionary struggle;
   he embeds Tweets in the fabric of this experimental novel; and social
   media posts interrupt and punctuate the narrative as in the real life of
   his millennial characters. In this article I explore the novel's
   representations of (social) media and the impact these have both on
   everyday lives and modes of protest. Despite promising beginnings, the
   internet ultimately turns `toxic' and is depicted as a Pandora's box of
   dis- and misinformation, conspiracy theories, fake news, and the
   manipulations of state media lackeys. A more lasting alternative to
   media may be `creative insurgency'. As such, I conclude this article by
   discussing what art can achieve that (citizen) journalism cannot, and
   how this applies to the novel's portrayals of art, particularly music.},

Title = {Examining relationships between psychotic experiences and suicidal
   ideation in adolescents using a network approach},
Journal = {SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {201},
Pages = {54-61},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in young
   individuals. Timely and adequate identification of individuals with
   suicidal ideation could prevent from suicidal behavior. Psychotic
   experiences (PE) have been shown to increase levels of suicidal ideation
   (SI) in the general population. Therefore, detailed investigation of the
   relationship of PE and SI is relevant. However, the exact nature of the
   relationship between these two phenomena remains unclear. Understanding
   psychopathology as a complex network of interacting symptoms could be
   helpful to elucidate specific associations existing between PE and SI.
   Method: A specific type of network analysis, the Isingmodel, was used to
   examine connections between dichotomized questions on psychotic
   experiences and suicidal ideation in a cross-sectional studywith 1685
   adolescents from the general population aged 13-18 years.
   Results: SI was mostly connected to the PE domains perceptual anomalies
   (PA) and bizarre experiences (BE), which have higher strength values in
   the network. Central nodes within these domains, as indexed by higher
   centrality measures (strength and betweenness) were: auditory
   experiences (PA1: hearing voices when you are alone), persecutory
   ideation (BE1: feelings of being persecuted; BE2: conspiracy against
   you), and social anxiety (SANX) (SANX1: I cannot get close to people).
   Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is differentially connected to specific
   psychotic experiences. Auditory PE, persecutory ideation, and social
   anxiety symptoms could play a central role in the interconnectedness of
   the two constructs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study was aimed at examining the vulnerability of
   Central Africa to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Demographic, health,
   and socio-economic indicators were used to describe the vulnerability.
   The study period was from December 31st, 2019 to May 31st, 2020 (i.e. 5
   months after the start of the pandemic). Results: According to
   demographic indicators, African populations appear younger than in
   Europe, Asia, and North America, where evidence showed a higher
   lethality of COVID-19 and a higher frequency of hospitalization among
   the elderly. This highlights the protective effect of the age structure
   of Central African populations. Their populations face significant
   vulnerability from high morbidity and a considerable deficit in health
   care facilities and services. Poverty indicators are not in their favour
   for a sustainable implementation of effective pandemic control measures.
   Very low literacy rates in some countries, misinformation, and belief in
   conspiracy theories could affect the community involvement in the
   response. Several countries are weakened by other humanitarian crises,
   including conflicts and other epidemics. The early easing of lockdown
   restrictions in certain countries could worsen the situation.
   Conclusion: In this sub-region, where the largest proportion of the
   population lives in poverty, poor sanitary conditions, conflicts, and
   humanitarian crises, the question of standards of prevention could
   appear to be a luxurious idea relegated to the background. Central
   African countries need financial and logistical support for a
   sustainable and effective response. These observations could be easily
   extrapolated to other sub-Saharan sub-regions.},

Title = {CHIPPING AWAY AT THE <i>ILLINOIS BRICK</i> WALL: THE USE OF
   <i>CALDER</i> JURISDICTION IN STATE INDIRECT PURCHASER LITIGATION},
Journal = {UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Number = {3},
Pages = {879-921},
Abstract = {Since the unraveling of the lysine price-fixing conspiracy, dramatized
   in the recent Hollywood film The Informant!, the rate of discovery of
   other price-fixing cartels has increased dramatically. When direct
   purchasers of the product ``pass on{''} the overcharges to indirect
   purchasers-those purchasers more than one step removed in the chain of
   distribution from the conspirator, and often the end consumer it is the
   indirect purchasers who bear the brunt of the harm. Indirect purchasers,
   however, are often barred from recovering damages. While many states,
   unlike the federal government, provide indirect purchasers with standing
   to file an antitrust suit against the violator, such actions are
   nonetheless often fruitless due to the lack of personal jurisdiction.
   This Note analyzes Supreme Court precedent in determining the issue of
   personal jurisdiction and proposes that the ``effects test{''} set forth
   in Calder v. Jones should be used to extend personal jurisdiction over
   antitrust violators in indirect purchaser suits to states where the harm
   of the violation was felt. This Note argues that a liberal application
   of the Calder analysis is necessary given antitrust suits' uniqueness,
   which distinguishes them from other intentional torts. This Note
   concludes that the use of Calder's ``effects test{''} to establish
   personal jurisdiction in indirect purchaser litigation is desirable from
   a policy standpoint, prevents circumvention of the purpose of
   legislation granting indirect purchasers standing to sue, and is
   consistent with ``traditional notions of fair play and substantial
   justice.{''}},

Abstract = {During 2009, while we were celebrating Charles Darwin and his The origin
   of species, sadly, little was said about the critical contribution of
   Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) to the development of the theory of
   evolution. Like Darwin, he was a truly remarkable nineteenth century
   intellect and polymath and, according to a recent book by Roy Davies
   (The Darwin conspiracy: origins of a scientific crime), he has a
   stronger claim to the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection than has
   Darwin. Here we present a critical comparison between the contributions
   of the two scientists. Sometimes referred to as `The other
   beetle-hunter' and largely neglected for many decades, Wallace had a far
   greater experience of collecting and investigating animals and plants
   from their native habitats than had Darwin. He was furthermore much more
   than a pioneer biogeographer and evolutionary theorist, and also made
   contributions to anthropology, ethnography, geology, land reform and
   social issues. However, being a more modest, self-deprecating man than
   Darwin, and lacking the latter's establishment connections, Wallace's
   contribution to the theory of evolution was not given the recognition it
   deserved and he was undoubtedly shabbily treated at the time. It is time
   that Wallace's relationship with Darwin is reconsidered in preparation
   for 2013, the centenary of Wallace's death, and he should be recognized
   as at least an equal in the Wallace-Darwin theory of evolution.},

Abstract = {Following Robertson's discussions on epistemic capital, the article
   analyses worldmaking procedures being used by members of one of the
   biggest neo-Pentecostal churches in Brazil - Igreja Universal do Reino
   de Deus. According to the popular narrative, social media, especially
   WhatsApp groups, contributed in a crucial way to the spread of sets of
   conspiracy theories aimed to question ``established narratives{''} and
   creating an image of Jair Bolsonaro, currently the president of Brazil,
   as the sole hero ({''}the messiah{''} and ``the myth{''}) fighting
   against the ``corrupted{''} Brazilian state and the
   ``globalist/communist cabal.{''} The article discusses interactions
   between members of so-called families created by the lgreja Universal do
   Reino de Deus. These families could have between a few or around one
   hundred members, and they are in regular communication (at least a few
   times per day) through WhatsApp. Most members of one family do not live
   in walking proximity; therefore, using WhatsApp is often the primary way
   they interact. The article puts families into a broader context of the
   media ecosystem owned or influenced by lgreja Universal do Reino de Deus
   and contextualizes the church as a religious ``infrastructure of
   knowing.{''} The article discusses sources of legitimization of
   particular knowledge produced and mediated between families. The article
   argues that communication in families contributes to the creation of
   unique epistemic tools crucial in re-creating individual worldviews of
   members lgreja Universal do Reino de Deus.},

Title = {Covid-19, social stigma and changing religious practice in Tablighi
   Jamaat communities in Lombok, Indonesia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The emergence of Covid-19 has presented serious challenges to people's
   lives, and as a result many are in the process of reconstructing aspects
   of what used to be considered `normal' life. In Indonesia, religious
   practice in 2020 experienced a kind of disempowerment and disruption in
   the areas of ritual and proselytization in Muslim communities. Religious
   people have been challenged to find ways to reconstruct their ritual and
   worship practices in safe ways that avoid spreading the virus. This
   article discusses the changes to religious practice and the ability to
   adapt to new forms of proselytization in Tablighi Jamaat environments
   where many followers have been infected with Covid-19. In particular,
   the article aims to explore how Tablighi Jamaat members interpret and
   define the Covid-19 pandemic, and what discourses have developed in
   their environments. Research for this article was conducted in Lombok,
   Indonesia from February till September 2020 and is based on observations
   and snowball-sampling interviews conducted online and offline with over
   50 individuals. When the Indonesian government locked down mosques and
   large meetings, the Tablighi Jamaat took a position that Covid-19 was
   not a serious danger-indeed they saw it as an anti-Islamic conspiracy,
   instead-and they continued to gather and preach as before. This led to a
   disease cluster from a Tablighi event in Gowa, South Sulawesi, causing a
   stigma in broader society toward the Tablighi practice of Islam.},

Abstract = {South Africa launched a mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign in May 2021,
   targeting 40 million adults. Understanding predictors of COVID-19
   vaccine intentions was required to achieve this goal. We conducted a
   population-based survey in June-July 2021 using the WHO Behavioral and
   Social Drivers (BeSD) of COVID-19 Vaccination tool to determine
   predictors of vaccine hesitancy, defined as intention to refuse or
   uncertainty whether to accept COVID-19 vaccination. There were 1193
   participants, mean age 39 (standard deviation 15) years, and 53\% women,
   of whom 58\% trusted information provided by healthcare workers and 32\%
   were vaccine hesitant. Independent predictors of vaccine hesitancy
   included concerns about side effects (odds ratio (OR) 11.41; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 3.5-50.80), lack of access to the online
   vaccine registration platform (OR 4.75; CI 2.15-10.37), distrust of
   government (OR 3.0; CI 1.33-6.77), belief in conspiracy theories (OR
   3.01; CI 1.32-6.77), having no monthly income (OR 1.84; CI 1.12-3.07),
   and depending on someone else to make vaccination decision (OR 2.47; CI
   1.06-5.77). We identified modifiable predictors of vaccine hesitancy at
   the start of South Africa's COVID-19 vaccination rollout. These factors
   should be addressed by different stakeholders involved in the national
   immunization program through tailored communication and other effective
   strategies that increase vaccine literacy, reach low-income households,
   and engender confidence in government.},

Abstract = {The problem of detecting bots, automated social media accounts governed
   by software but disguising as human users, has strong implications. For
   example, bots have been used to sway political elections by distorting
   online discourse, to manipulate the stock market, or to push
   anti-vaccine conspiracy theories that may have caused health epidemics.
   Most techniques proposed to date detect bots at the account level, by
   processing large amounts of social media posts, and leveraging
   information from network structure, temporal dynamics, sentiment
   analysis, etc. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based on
   contextual long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture that exploits both
   content and metadata to detect bots at the tweet level: contextual
   features are extracted from user metadata and fed as auxiliary input to
   LSTM deep nets processing the tweet text. Another contribution that we
   make is proposing a technique based on synthetic minority oversampling
   to generate a large labeled dataset, suitable for deep nets training,
   from a minimal amount of labeled data (roughly 3000 examples of
   sophisticated Twitter hots). We demonstrate that, from just one single
   tweet, our architecture can achieve high classification accuracy (AUC >
   96\%) in separating bots from humans. We apply the same architecture to
   account-level bot detection, achieving nearly perfect classification
   accuracy (AUC > 99\%). Our system outperforms previous state of the art
   while leveraging a small and interpretable set of features, yet
   requiring minimal training data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Peculiarities of quantum radiation in three dimensions from moving

Abstract = {In the prefect reflector limit n --> proportional to, the photon pairs
   radiated by a moving three-dimensional half-space with nondispersive
   refractive index n = root e mu show peculiarities unheralded in 1D. The
   radiated power (per unit area) is different for n(2) = epsilon and n(2)
   = mu (cases 1 and 2, respectively). The half-space is taken to oscillate
   harmonically either parallel or normally to its surface, and to interact
   with a massless scalar field; for normal motion in case 1 (2) the power
   is then identical to the electromagnetic power flowing into
   transverse-electric (transverse-magnetic) modes from a true dielectric
   with n(2) = epsilon. Even in the limit, the power radiated inwards into
   the perfectly reflecting material remains finite, except for sideways
   motion in case 2. This paradoxical behaviour stems from the unfamiliar
   kinematics of such photon pairs, admitting peculiar and
   dimensionality-dependent conspiracies between vanishing matrix elements
   and diverging phase-space volumes. For outward radiation from normal
   oscillations, the perfect-reflector limits tally with those implied by
   results already known for the Maxwell field. For sideways oscillations,
   the outward power vanishes as n --> proportional to, at different rates
   in cases 1 and 2; but it is always dominated by photons whose partners
   have travelled inwards. Appendices outline the opposite regime of dilute
   media with n close to unity, and contrast 3D with 1D. (C) 1996 Academic

   approaches to stopping disinformation, which aim to clarify facts,
   intercept the spread of existing disinformation, and quarantine the
   source of disinformation, respectively. In this paper, we study the
   collaboration of the above three countermeasures in defending
   disinformation. Specifically, considering an online social network, we
   study the most cost-effective dynamic budget allocation (DBA) strategy
   for the three methods to minimize the proportion of
   disinformation-supportive accounts on the network with the lowest
   expenditure. For convenience, we refer to the search for the optimal DBA
   strategy as the DBA problem. Our contributions are as follows. First, we
   propose a disinformation propagation model to characterize the effects
   of different DBA strategies on curbing disinformation. On this basis, we
   establish a trade-off model for DBA strategies and reduce the DBA
   problem to an optimal control model. Second, we derive an optimality
   system for the optimal control model and develop a heuristic numerical
   algorithm called the DBA algorithm to solve the optimality system. With
   the DBA algorithm, we can find possible optimal DBA strategies. Third,
   through numerical experiments, we estimate key model parameters, examine
   the obtained DBA strategy, and verify the effectiveness of the DBA
   algorithm. Results show that the DBA algorithm is effective.},

Abstract = {Introduction COVID-19 has had a catastrophic impact on the world. The
   current death toll far exceeds 6 million and large numbers of patients
   are experiencing long-term medical and psychiatric morbidity from the
   infection. The immunopathology of severe COVID-19 is now better
   understood. In severely affected patients, there is a chaotic,
   destructive immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2, where autoimmunity
   features prominently. Areas covered COVID-19 vaccines ensure a
   coordinated, balanced immune response to future SARS-CoV-2 infection.
   The rapid global deployment of effective COVID-19 vaccines has been
   hindered by financial, logistical and political barriers. Of concern is
   increasing vaccine hesitancy caused by unfounded conspiracy theories of
   vaccine adverse effects, often fueled by misinformation and
   disinformation on social media. Expert opinion This perspective
   discusses the potential impact of the so-called
   Autoimmune/autoinflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants (ASIA) on
   COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Proponents of the ASIA syndrome have
   inappropriately linked infertility to HPV vaccines and have recently
   suggested antigenic cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and ovarian
   follicles. COVID-19 vaccines have also been linked to ASIA and unfounded
   fear of infertility is a leading cause of vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine
   hesitancy caused by spurious disorders such as ASIA are likely to harm
   individuals and delay global vaccination efforts leading to emergence of
   vaccine and monoclonal antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants, thereby
   prolonging the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Uncertainty is ubiquitous, and its resolution is a fundamental
   motivation for human behavior. People strive to reduce uncertainty,
   especially uncertainties that reflect on, or are directly about, who
   they are-self-uncertainty. This chapter describes and reviews
   uncertainty-identity theory, with a particular focus on advances and
   developments over the past 15 years. The key premise of the theory is
   that context-induced self-uncertainty motivates uncertainty reduction,
   and that one of the most effective ways to reduce self-uncertainty is
   group identification through self-categorization. Group identification
   reduces uncertainty because it causes people to internalize a shared
   identity and associated group prototype, which defines and prescribes
   who one is and how one should behave, and describes how one will be
   perceived and treated by others. However, some groups and identities are
   better equipped to reduce self-uncertainty-specifically, distinctive
   groups with clearly defined and prescriptive identities that are
   relatively unambiguous and consensual. In more extreme circumstances and
   manifestations, self-uncertainty can motivate a strong preference for
   and zealous identification with extremist groups-groups that have
   identities that echo populist ideology and behavior, and associated
   conspiracy theories and narratives of victimhood, and have strong and
   directive leaders who can be populist, autocratic and toxic.
   Uncertainty-identity theory is a motivational account of group and
   intergroup behavior, and social identity phenomena; but it can also
   explain the conditions under which radicalization and extremism arise
   and the various forms they can take.},

Abstract = {The communication of information about vaccines and anti-vaccines is
   analyzed through the monitoring of issuers, news sites, groups, and
   messages in social networks. We also investigate the effects of
   information on people's attention, emotion, and engagement, which were
   analyzed using eye tracking, galvanic skin response (GSR) and facial
   expression methods. Results: the flow of communication was not constant,
   both in the press and on web sites (376 news in 2015, 74 in 2016, 69 in
   2017 and, 268 in 2018); posts were informative and neutral; and 80\%
   came from non-professional sources (only 17\% were written by a
   journalist and 3\% by a health specialist). On social networks,
   anti-vaccine Facebook messages and groups were identified, and a mapping
   of influencers is presented. Analysis of the temporal evolution (years
   2015 to 2018) of communicative flows showed that anti-vaccine posts
   decreased. Gender differences appeared in the visual exploration of
   information sources and in the provoked emotion responses (GSR and
   facial expression). In pro-vaccine pages women looked at the headline
   first, while men looked at the photograph. Emotional responses and
   engagement did not show differences between anti-vaccine and pro-vaccine
   web sites. No differences were found in the emotion provoked (GSR)
   between both website types: anti-vaccination persuasion occurred via
   cognitive, not emotional, methods by using heuristics (e.g., conspiracy
   theories). Emotional responses and engagement did not show differences
   between pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine web sites.},

Abstract = {Background. - Diversity has become the norm in major urban centers
   around the world. Differences of language and culture strain the
   capacity of mental health systems to provide appropriate diagnostic
   assessment and treatment planning, especially in critical settings like
   the emergency department and inpatient services.
   Objective. - To demonstrate how the Cultural Consultation (CC) model
   overcomes obstacles to effective cross-cultural psychiatric care in the
   hospital setting.
   Method. - The author reviews the process of Cultural Consultation
   developed by the Cultural Consultation Service (CCS) at McGill
   University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He uses clinical vignettes to
   illustrate how to work with ethnically diverse patients and their
   families. He compares and contrasts models of cross-cultural care and
   discusses strategies to remove potential barriers from the clinic.
   Results. - Several challenges complicate cross-cultural psychiatry in
   hospitals: (1) setting-specific issues, such as time pressure, less than
   ideal interview space, lack of professional language interpreters, and
   severe symptomatology of patients; and (2) systemic social factors that
   limit the open discussion of issues most relevant to many immigrants and
   refugees: matters of religion, racism, intolerance, and adjustment to
   life in the host society.
   Conclusions. - Setting specific and systemic social factors may combine
   to create a conspiracy of silence in which patients and caregivers from
   diverse backgrounds avoid discussing fundamental mental health concerns.
   Cultural Consultation offers a means to negotiate differences of
   language and culture while respecting the clinical imperatives of the
   hospital setting. (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes findings from a rapid-response community-based
   qualitative research initiative to study the content of Ebola-related
   communications and the transmission of Ebola-related behaviors and
   practices through mass media communications and social learning in
   Monrovia, Liberia during August-September 2014. Thirteen neighborhoods
   in the common Monrovia media market were studied to appraise the reach
   of health communications and outreach regarding Ebola prevention and
   response measures. A World Health Organization (WHO) research team
   collected data on social learning and Ebola knowledge, attitudes, and
   practices through focus group-based discussions and key informant
   interviews over a 14-day period to assess the spread of information
   during a period of rapidly escalating crisis. Findings show that during
   a 2-week period, Monrovia neighborhood residents demonstrated rapid
   changes in beliefs about the source of Ebola, modes of contagion, and
   infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, discarding incorrect
   information. Changes in practices tended to lag behind the acquisition
   of learning. Findings also show that many continued to support
   conspiracy theories even as correct information was acquired. The
   implications for community engagement are substantial: (1) Under
   conditions of accelerating mortality, communities rapidly assimilate
   health information and abandon incorrect information; (2) Behavior
   change is likely to lag behind changes in beliefs due to local physical,
   structural, sociocultural, and institutional constraints; (3) Reports of
   resistance in Monrovia during the Ebola response were overstated and
   based on a limited number of incidents, and failed to account for
   specific local conditions and constraints.},

Abstract = {The fallen Byzantine Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes was cruelly blinded on
   the 29th June 1072. This was a penalty to punish him and was designed to
   deter him from any possible ambition of retaking the throne. Any
   mutilation would disqualify an individual from taking the throne since
   an Emperor had to be unblemished. The penalty of blinding was recognized
   as capital punishment, similar to the various punishments by death.
   Subject to the Emperor's mercy, the death penalty could be replaced by
   blinding, which resulted in complete loss of vision and was considered
   to be a lifelong punishment. Blinding was a recognized penalty for
   political rivals and for the crime of ``high treason{''} (kathosiosis).
   All people who were not cleared of conspiracy or who contested the power
   of the Emperor had to be punished. Blinding was accomplished by gouging
   out the eyes, often using a hot poker or by pouring a boiling substance,
   such as vinegar, on them. Despite receiving assurances of his personal
   safety, Diogenes was blinded on the order of the new Emperor in Kotyaion
   (Kioutahya) by a Jew, who, due to inexperience, needed three attempts to
   perform the task, using a sharp metal object. Without medical
   assistance, the wound became infected and Diogenes soon developed
   periocular tissue sepsis with head and facial edema and worms falling
   out of his ocular injuries. Five weeks later he died on Prote Island in
   the Sea of Marmara, on the 4th August 1072.},

Title = {Narrative Reconfigurations of Islamic Eschatological Signs: The Portents
   of the ``Hour{''} in Grey Literature and on the Internet},
Journal = {ARCHIV ORIENTALNI},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {83},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {411+},
Abstract = {Current political developments have not only been interpreted by Muslim
   religious scholars and individual laymen as signs, which inaugurate the
   end of time (ashrat al-sa'a), but these eschatological interpretations
   have also been and still are being instrumentalized by various religious
   and political groups. Among them, for example, the IS (dawla islamiyya)
   in Iraq and Syria, which has inaugurated an eschatological fear that is
   mirrored in numerous online discussion forums and online publications.
   Especially in social media and grey literature, motifs and figures that
   appear at the end of time according to the aladith and the Qur'an, are
   often reinterpreted and synthesized with other sources, ideologies,
   worldviews and conspiracy theories. The article explores these narrative
   reconfigurations, focusing on these central motifs or figures: the
   Dajjal and its apocalyptic antagonist, the Mahdi, tribulations and
   trials (fitan) and the political victory over a perceived enemy. It
   reveals that the ``end{''} and the last things identified in these
   narratives are often reinterpreted as a political turn and change in the
   here and now through spatial and historical reconfigurations. We argue
   that the functions of these narratives are manifold: They can provide a
   simple orientation by means of a clear cut dualistic identification of
   good and evil, or they can offer meaning to otherwise hardly
   understandable or bearable events. They can also act as a call for
   political action in a declared sacral conflict.},

Abstract = {Aims: To examine how a rural community profoundly affected by escalating
   rates of largely AIDS-related deaths of young and middle-aged people
   makes sense of this phenomenon and its impact on their everyday lives.
   Methods: Data were collected in Agincourt subdistrict, Limpopo Province.
   Twelve focus groups were constituted according to age and gender and met
   three times (a total of 36 focus-group discussions {[}FGDs]). The FGDs
   explored sequentially people's expectations of their lives in the
   ``new{''} South Africa, their interpretations of the acceleration of
   death amongst the young and middle-aged, and their understandings of
   HIV/AIDS. Discussions were recorded, fully transcribed, and thematically
   analysed. Results: Respondents acknowledged escalating death rates in
   their community, yet few referred directly to HIV/AIDS as the cause.
   Rather, respondents focused on the social and cultural causes of death,
   including the erosion of cultural norms and traditions such as cultural
   taboos on sex. There are many competing versions of what HIV/AIDS is,
   what causes it and how it is spread, ranging from scientific
   explanations to conspiracy theories. Findings highlight the relationship
   between AIDS and other traditional diseases with some respondents
   suggesting that AIDS is a new form of other longstanding illnesses.
   Conclusions: This study points to the centrality of cultural
   explanations in understanding ``bad death{''} (AIDS death) in the
   Agincourt area. Physical illness is understood to be a symptom of
   ``cultural damage{''}. Implications of this for public health practice
   and research are outlined.},

Abstract = {This case study contributes to the literature on state terror, and
   political violence in general, by looking at the specific ways in which
   regimes of terror are mapped onto urban spaces and the ways in which
   that `topography' is contested by social movements physically redefining
   those spaces. The article moves between dimensions of how the meanings
   of urban spaces are culturally and historically evoked to an analysis of
   the ways in which women protesters challenge and transform those
   meanings through action. The article shows that the use of public and
   private spaces by state aggressors and human rights groups has followed
   a consistent logic in the Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay).
   Specifically, the occupation of these spaces reveals a pattern based on
   the gender of the social actors involved, and forms a process we call
   the gendering of landscapes. Throughout the Southern Cone private spaces
   are conducive for the abduction of state enemies and for anti-state
   conspiracy. Public spaces serve as important landmarks for detention and
   torture as well as protesting state terror. The dialectic or resolution
   of these uses of the city offer distinct interpretations about the
   meaning of social justice which can enhance our understanding of this
   region's transition to civilian rule: `brutality knows no ideology
   because its goal is the same; to silence dissent through the destruction
   of healthy bodies and minds' (Eric Stover and Elena Nightingale 1985,
   from The breaking of bodies and minds).},

Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic fueled one of the most rapid vaccine
   developments in history. However, misinformation spread through online
   social media often leads to negative vaccine sentiment and hesitancy.
   Methods: To investigate COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion in social
   media, we conducted a sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
   topic modeling on textual data collected from 13 Reddit commu-nities
   focusing on the COVID-19 vaccine from Dec 1, 2020, to May 15, 2021. Data
   were aggregated and analyzed by month to detect changes in any sentiment
   and latent topics. Results: Polarity analysis suggested these
   communities expressed more positive sentiment than negative regarding
   the vaccine-related discussions and has remained static over time. Topic
   modeling revealed community members mainly focused on side effects
   rather than outlandish conspiracy theories. Conclusion: Covid-19
   vaccine-related content from 13 subreddits show that the sentiments
   expressed in these communities are overall more positive than negative
   and have not meaningfully changed since December 2020. Keywords
   indicating vaccine hesitancy were detected throughout the LDA topic
   model -ing. Public sentiment and topic modeling analysis regarding
   vaccines could facilitate the implementation of appropriate messaging,
   digital interventions, and new policies to promote vaccine confidence.

Title = {Dancing the <i>Kolomyika</i> at the Opera-Comique: Leo Delibes's
   Galician Opera <i>Kassya</i>},
Journal = {AUSTRIAN HISTORY YEARBOOK},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {134-162},
Abstract = {In the spring 1893, the following statement appeared in a theater review
   in one of the Parisian dailies: Mais, dans ce diable de pays de Galicie,
   on n'est jamais tranquille et il faut toujours craindre pour le
   lendemain {[}But, in this hell of a land Galicia, it's never quiet, and
   one must always fear for tomorrow]. These words were written in response
   to the first, and perhaps the only, opera produced in Western Europe
   about the Austrian province of Galicia. The work's plot centered on a
   love triangle between a count, a gypsy girl, and a peasant, and was set
   against the historical backdrop of the Galician peasant uprising of
   1846. The opera in question, Kassya, was the swan song of French
   composer Leo Delibes, written after a trip he took to Hungary and
   Austrian Galicia. The critic who penned the above words, Georges Street,
   certainly knew something about intrigue and conspiracy within the
   Austrian Empire. He was the grandson of Metternich's master spy, Georg
   Klindworth, and the son of Agnes Street-Klindworth, who gathered
   intelligence for her father about refugees of the 1848 upheavals living
   in Weimar. Delibes's opera and Street's biography interconnect only
   circumstantiallythe former composed the music to Kassya; the latter
   attended a performance and wrote a reviewyet this coincidence suggests
   an interesting avenue for investigation regarding French contacts with
   East Central Europe.},

Title = {Induced CMB quadrupole from pointing offsets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS},
Year = {2011},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent claims in the literature have suggested that the WMAP quadrupole
   is not primordial in origin, and arises from an aliasing of the much
   larger dipole field because of incorrect satellite pointing. We attempt
   to reproduce this result and delineate the key physics leading to the
   effect. We find that, even if real, the induced quadrupole would be
   smaller than the WMAP value. We discuss reasons why the WMAP data are
   unlikely to suffer from this particular systematic effect, including the
   implications for observations of point sources. Given this evidence
   against the reality of the effect, the similarity between the
   pointing-offset-induced signal and the actual quadrupole then appears to
   be quite puzzling. However, we find that the effect arises from a
   convolution between the gradient of the dipole field and anisotropic
   coverage of the scan direction at each pixel. There is something of a
   directional conspiracy here - the dipole signal lies close to the
   Ecliptic Plane, and its direction, together with the WMAP scan strategy,
   results in a strong coupling to the Y-2,Y--1 component in Ecliptic
   co-ordinates. The dominant strength of this component in the measured
   quadrupole suggests that one should exercise increased caution in
   interpreting its estimated amplitude. The Planck satellite has a
   different scan strategy which does not so directly couple the dipole and
   quadrupole in this way and will soon provide an independent measurement.},

Title = {The QAnon movement: A modern facticity complex},
Journal = {EVOLUTION PSYCHIATRIQUE},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objectives. - The current era of post-truth invites reflection on what
   constitutes the networks of influence, power, and counter-power of our
   modern world that seem to have affected the unconscious organization of
   social groups. Can the study of this phenomenon of post-truth extend the
   psychoanalytical analyses of the singularities of the work of culture in
   our modern world?
   Method. - The study of the QAnon sphere of influence, in a
   trans-disciplinary approach between human sciences and psychoanalysis,
   brings to light the unconscious stakes of this movement that represents
   the post-truth era.
   Results. - QAnon brings out radically participatory conspiracy theories,
   marked by the use of new technologies. The movement is engaged in an
   enterprise of fictionalizing the world of power, through processes of
   storytelling.
   Discussion. - The group dynamics of the QAnon movement are characterized
   by the resonance of individualities around a complex of the duplicity
   and facticity of powerful figures. This complex is governed by
   borderline mechanisms of projective and intrusive identification,
   strongly mobilized by a society with fewer and fewer anchors in the
   public space and one that is increasingly inclined to self-exposure on
   virtual-digital networks.
   Conclusion. - Post-truth reveals a ``complex of facticity{''} in the
   world. The relationship of a risk-management society to the Internet may
   have been the breeding ground for unconscious organizers of a new kind,
   fostering the emergence of this fictional relationship to the world that
   characterizes post-truth. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Pages = {182-190},
Abstract = {Freemasonry has been the subject of many conspiracy theories. What is
   the real role of Freema-sonry in history, especially in the Age of
   Enlightenment and during the bourgeois revolutions of the 18th and the
   19th Centuries? Freemasonry is both a social club and an esoteric
   philosophy. The masonic philosophy is expressed through a complex system
   of symbols and rituals. In her book The Rosicrucian Enlightenment
   historian Frances Yeats regards this philosophy as a bridge between the
   way of thinking of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, between
   symbolic synthetic thinking and analytical thinking and experimental
   science. The Grand Lodge of England was founded in 1717, after the
   Glorious Revolution. The masonic lodge was a place where Anglicans and
   Puritans, bourgeoisie and nobility met and could work together after the
   Civil War. The masonic notion of ``Great Architect of the Universe{''}
   includes the idea of God in all Abrahamic religions as well as the
   rationalistic deistic idea of God. Freemasons created the Royal Society
   of London for the Ad-vancement of Science. George Washington and most of
   the Founding Fathers of the United States were also Freemasons. Many
   revolutionaries, like Marquis de Lafayette, Simon Bolivar, San Mar-in,
   Jose Marti, and Giuseppe Garibaldi were Freemasons, as well as Zakhari
   Stoyanov, Angel Kanchev and Nikola Obretenov in Bulgaria. Although it
   doesn't have such great importance in today's society, Freemasonry
   played a significant role in the creation of modern Western
   democra-cies.},

Journal = {FORDHAM LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {84},
Number = {3},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Two key trends were present in the successful prosecution of Raj
   Rajaratnam and his coconspirators in one of the largest insider-trading
   conspiracies in history: the use of wiretaps to investigate and
   prosecute insider trading and a joint effort between the Department of
   Justice (DOJ) and the Securities \& Exchange Commission (SEC) to conduct
   the investigation. Despite the close working relationship between the
   DOJ and the SEC, the DOJ never disclosed the fruits of the wiretaps to
   the SEC, presumably due to its belief that Title III of the Omnibus
   Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (as amended, the ``Wiretap
   Act{''})-the comprehensive framework that authorizes the government to
   conduct wiretaps in certain circumstances-prohibited it from doing so.
   Though the Second Circuit in SEC v. Rajaratnam ultimately held that the
   SEC could obtain wiretap materials from the criminal defendants as part
   of civil discovery, the question of whether direct disclosure of the
   wiretap materials from the DOJ to the SEC is prohibited has been raised
   but not yet addressed. This Note analyzes previous cases addressing the
   construction of the Wiretap Act's disclosure provisions and concludes
   that direct disclosure from the DOJ to the SEC is not prohibited by the
   Act. It further proposes a process by which civil enforcement agencies,
   such as the SEC, can request disclosure of wiretap materials through the
   DOJ in such a way that balances the benefits of disclosure against the
   privacy interests of the parties whose conversations were intercepted.},

Title = {A Qualitative Study of Vaccine Acceptability and Decision Making among
   Pregnant Women in Morocco during the A (H1N1) pdm09 Pandemic},

Abstract = {Vaccination uptake of pregnant women in Morocco during the A (H1N1)
   pdm09 pandemic was lower than expected. A qualitative study using
   open-ended questions was developed to explore the main determinants of
   acceptance and nonacceptance of the monovalent A (H1N1) pdm09 vaccine
   among pregnant women in Morocco and to identify information sources that
   influenced their decision-making process. The study sample included 123
   vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women who were in their second or
   third trimester between December 2009 and March 2010. They took part in
   14 focus group discussions and eight in-depth interviews in the
   districts of Casablanca and Kenitra. Thematic qualitative analysis
   identified reasons for vaccine non-acceptance: (1) fear of the
   monovalent A (H1N1) pdm09 vaccine, (2) belief in an A (H1N1) pdm09
   pandemic conspiracy, (3) belief in the inapplicability of the monovalent
   A (H1N1) pdm09 vaccine to Moroccans, (4) lack of knowledge of the
   monovalent A (H1N1) pdm09 vaccine, and (5) challenges of vaccination
   services/logistics. Reasons for vaccine acceptance included: (1)
   perceived benefits and (2) modeling. Decision-making was strongly
   influenced by family, community, mass media, religious leaders and
   health providers suggesting that broad communication efforts should also
   be used to advocate for vaccination. Meaningful communication for future
   vaccine campaigns must consider these context-specific findings. As
   cultural and religious values are shared across many Arab countries,
   these findings may also provide valuable insights for seasonal influenza
   vaccine planning in the Middle East and North Africa region at large.},

Abstract = {A study of mass distributions in 22 spiral galaxies, with rotation
   curves taken from the literature and Hubble types ranging from Sa to Sd,
   is presented. It is demonstrated that a relation of the form
   M-d(r) = gamma M-1/2(r)r
   between the mass distribution of the luminous components M(r) and that
   of the dark halo M-d(r) is consistent with the observed kinematics with
   only the dark-to-visible mass ratio displaying significant variations
   between galaxies. The parameter gamma, which is correlated with
   M-dyn/M-lum, characterizes the relative importance of the
   dark-to-luminous mass. The model M/L ratio of the stellar component,
   M/L-B(stars), is correlated with the observed B-V color. In our sample
   the average model {[}M/L-B(stars)] of Sb galaxies is 2.7 M-. L-.(-1) for
   an average color {[}(B-V)(o)] = 0.71, that of the Sc's is
   {[}M/L-B(stars)] = 1.5 M-. L-.(-1) for {[}(B-V)(o)] = 0.54, both values
   being in very good agreement with population synthesis models. A large
   part of the intrinsic scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation is due to the
   spread in gamma. The relation of coupling accounts for the disk-halo
   conspiracy in HSB spirals and is also valid in LSB dwarf galaxies. Its
   universality in disk rotating systems implies the existence of a
   physical mechanism responsible for the continuity between visible and
   dark mass distributions.},

Abstract = {The Supreme Court of India (SC) pronounced a momentous judgment in
   Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan in 1997, categorically recognizing the
   menace of sexual harassment (SH) at workplace and constitutionally
   rendering it as being in violation of fundamental rights guaranteed by
   Articles 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India 1950. The Court
   also provided a mechanism for redressal against SH, which was ultimately
   reinforced by Parliament with the enactment of Sexual Harassment at
   Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013 (POSH Act).
   However, when it comes to allegations of SH against judges in the SC and
   High Courts by its employees, interns, or lower court judges, the
   response of the SC has been abysmal to say the least. There is a
   systematic pattern to suggest foul play and conspiracy in each such
   allegation, and judges, including even the Chief Justice of India (CJI),
   have not hesitated to openly indulge in victim-shaming and-blaming. In
   other words, the court has not been able to uphold its own jurisprudence
   on sexual harassment, which it expects to be scrupulously adhered to by
   other organs of the state. It is submitted that in not supporting the
   cause of victims alleging SH against judges, the other organs of the
   state are also party to this constitutional decay and serious infraction
   of fundamental rights. It leads us to ask the question, how can we guard
   against the guardians?},

Abstract = {Resistance to Persuasion (RP) is an important construct allowing to
   understand attitude change (or its absence) after persuasive attempts.
   Theorized as an individual attribute, no research has yet investigated
   the potential presence of prescriptive norms of judgment surrounding the
   display of RP by individuals. In line with the prevalence of
   individualistic values within occidental societies-where individuals are
   expected to be self-determined, autonomous, self-reliant, confident, and
   skillful-the present contribution therefore investigated whether
   displaying RP was subjected to social valorization. A first study, using
   a self-presentation paradigm (within subjects, N = 106), showed that
   displaying RP conveyed a negative image of oneself. A second study,
   using a social judgment task (between subjects, N = 189), showed that
   targets displaying high RP were seen as less warm but more competent
   than targets displaying low RP. This effect was conceptually replicated
   in a third study using a different social judgment task (between
   subjects, N = 219). These results are interpreted in terms of social
   power and resistance to social influence. Practical implications are
   then discussed from two important perspectives: (a) the potential
   usefulness of power priming as a way to increase RP; (b) social norms
   surrounding RP as crucial moderators of intervention outcomes (e.g.,
   focusing on critical thinking promotion). The existence of social
   valorization of not being resistant could be leveraged and could be
   crucial for applied psychologists, especially to optimize interventions
   aiming to fight against the spread of conspiracy theories and fake news
   among the public.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Pages = {165-180},
Abstract = {The article is the result of research into a kind of political
   communication poorly studied in Russia, which is very popular in actual
   political life - an attack on an opponent's reputation with the goal of
   destroying it and depriving the opponent of support from significant
   target groups. A study of character assassination from the moment of the
   bourgeois revolution in Russia until the collapse of the Soviet Union
   shows the continuity of methods and techniques and the use of similar
   themes and subjects throughout this period. Public perception of
   character assassination in relation to the victims of the attack in
   general reflects the tendency of support of the head of the state, if
   the population recognizes him as the leader. The article discusses three
   cases showing the most important tendencies of character assassination
   in a certain historical period: the character assassination of Lenin as
   a German spy; the character assassination of Tukhachevsky and a group of
   military leaders as the organizers of the ``military-fascist
   conspiracy{''}; and the character assassination of Sakharov as an
   anti-Soviet human rights activist. The notion of a ``foreign agent{''}
   has become the umbrella element of all studied character assassination
   campaigns. These cases make it possible to see the behavior of the
   attackers and their victims, the main methods and topics used to kill
   the reputation, the use of various types of media, the reaction of
   society, ways to defense against the character assassination.},

Journal = {ANNALES HISTORIQUES DE LA REVOLUTION FRANCAISE},
Year = {2017},
Number = {388},
Pages = {3+},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {For a longtime, the concepts of Utopia and Revolution were considered
   contradictory : the image of an ideal city seemed incompatible with the
   testing of reforms that provoked social and political tensions in actual
   time. This article suggests other interpretations founded on a large
   collection of literary works, as well as on reform projects aiming to
   transform society before and during the Revolutionary decade. Some
   social utopias, based on natural law, and architectural utopias preceded
   the French Revolution in the second half of the century of the
   Enlightenment. The Revolution caused an explosion of the utopian genre
   including the timeless tradition; the positive or negative appraisals of
   Revolutionary work; and the desire for a radical transformation of
   social relations. The advent of the Republic saw the introduction of
   much desired egalitarian reforms in matters of education, family, social
   relations. During the Montagnard period, utopia manifested itself as a
   concept in schools, theater, festivals, and the Republican calendar.
   Against a dominant liberal culture, the Conspiracy of Equals and
   Babouvism aspired to surpass the utopian novels of Mably and Morelly,
   taking some lessons from the Thermidorian Reaction, to envisage an ideal
   city, a community, abolishing private property, and necessitating the
   seizure of power by an advanced avant-garde. If the Revolution could do
   away with some utopias and generate counter-utopias, it conceived and
   applied social reforms suggestive of a utopia, and preparing beyond
   these failures the utopias of the following generation :
   Saint-Simoniens, Blanquistes, Fourieristes, Icariens.},

Abstract = {Land reclaimed from navigable waters is a resource uniquely susceptible
   to conflict. The multiple reasons for this include traditional hostility
   to interference with navigable waterways and the weakness of rights in
   submerged land. In Illinois, title to land reclaimed from Lake Michigan
   was further clouded by a shift in judicial understanding in the late
   nineteenth century about who owned the submerged land, starting with an
   assumption of private ownership but eventually embracing state
   ownership. The potential for such legal uncertainty to produce conflict
   is vividly illustrated by the history of the area of Chicago known as
   Streeterville, the area of reclaimed land along Lake Michigan north of
   the Chicago River and east of Michigan Avenue. Beginning in the 1850s,
   Streeterville was subject to repeated waves of litigation, assertions of
   squatters' rights (most notably by George Wellington Streeter, for whom
   the area is named), conspiracies to obtain federal land grants based on
   veterans' rights, schemes in reliance on claims of Native Americans, and
   a public works project designed to secure the claims of wealthy riparian
   owners. The riparian owners eventually won the many-sided battle, but
   only after convincing institutions such as Northwestern University to
   build substantial structures on the land. The history of Streeterville
   suggests that when legal title to reclaimed land is highly uncertain,
   conflict over control of the land is likely to persist until one or more
   persons succeed in establishing what is perceived to be possession of
   the land.},

Abstract = {Based on virtual ethnography and online interviews, we provide new
   evidence of how fact-checking organizations based in Zimbabwe, South
   Africa and Namibia responded to the influx of conspiracy theories, mis-
   and disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study seeks to
   answer the following questions: What kind of responses did ZimFact,
   Africa Check and Namibia Fact Check put in place to combat the spread of
   the `disinfodemic' during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Southern Africa?
   To what extent were these interventions effective in terms of combating
   the viral spread of the `disinfodemic' in the broader information
   ecosystem? It argues that through a combination of manual and
   technology-enabled verification processes, these organizations were
   partly able to debunk some of the harmful, conspiratorial and misleading
   claims related to the coronavirus. It demonstrates that fact-checking
   alone is not enough to stem the `disinfodemic' unless it is complemented
   by an ecosystem that prioritizes access to information, media literacy
   initiatives, proactive takedown interventions by platform companies and
   increased public awareness on truthful and credible public health
   information. Furthermore, fact-checking organizations need to increase
   the speed at which they respond to the `disinfodemic' if virality, which
   is the major driver of this `phenomenon', is to be mitigated. We
   recommend that fact-checkers should implement efficient mechanisms of
   decentralizing their activities, amplify the sharing of verified
   information, forge collaborative initiatives with key actors and ramp up
   critical media literacy programmes.},

Title = {Vaccine Hesitancy and Anti-Vaccination Attitudes during the Start of
   COVID-19 Vaccination Program: A Content Analysis on Twitter Data},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Twitter is a useful source for detecting anti-vaccine content due to the
   increasing prevalence of these arguments on social media. We aimed to
   identify the prominent themes about vaccine hesitancy and refusal on
   social media posts in Turkish during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this
   qualitative study, we collected public tweets (n = 551,245) that
   contained a vaccine-related keyword and had been published between 9
   December 2020 and 8 January 2021 through the Twitter API. A random
   sample of tweets (n = 1041) was selected and analyzed by four
   researchers with the content analysis method. We found that 90.5\% of
   the tweets were about vaccines, 22.6\% (n = 213) of the tweets mentioned
   at least one COVID-19 vaccine by name, and the most frequently mentioned
   COVID-19 vaccine was CoronaVac (51.2\%). We found that 22.0\% (n = 207)
   of the tweets included at least one anti-vaccination theme. Poor
   scientific processes (21.7\%), conspiracy theories (16.4\%), and
   suspicions towards manufacturers (15.5\%) were the most frequently
   mentioned themes. The most co-occurring themes were ``poor scientific
   process{''} with ``suspicion towards manufacturers{''} (n = 9), and
   ``suspicion towards health authorities{''} (n = 5). This study may be
   helpful for health managers, assisting them to identify the major
   concerns of the population and organize preventive measures through the
   significant role of social media in early spread of information about
   vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccination attitudes.},

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate Chinese guardians' willingness to vaccinate
   teenagers (WVT) against COVID-19, we conducted a national wide survey in
   31 provinces in mainland China. Methods: We involved 16133 guardians
   from 31 provinces in Chinese Mainland from August 6th to 9th, 2021. The
   question ``Are you willing to vaccinate teenagers of COVID-19
   vaccine?{''} was designed to capture WVT. Odds ratios (OR) with 95\%
   Confidence Intervals (CI) for potential factors of WVT were estimated
   using multiple logistic regression models. Results: In total, 13327
   (82.61\%) of the respondents expressed positive WVT, 12.90\% of the
   respondents were uncertain but inclined to vaccinate their teenagers.
   Meanwhile, 3.89\% of the respondents were uncertain and inclined to
   reject, and 0.60\% of the respondents rejected the vaccines. After
   adjusting for potential confounders, the married, total family income
   last year, reject to Categoly1 vaccines, access information about the
   COVID-19 vaccines from community workers, low COVID-19 vaccine
   conspiracy, guardian's vaccination behavior, and the importance of
   vaccinating teenagers were all independent factors that affected the
   guardians' likely to accept. Further, the current study found that lower
   trust in doctors and vaccine developers was associated with negative
   WVT. The reasons for negative WVT included teenagers' young age and
   guardians' worries on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.
   Conclusion: This large-scale study assessed Chinese guardians' WVT
   against COVID-19, as well as its potential influencing factors, which is
   useful for international and national decision-makers.},

Abstract = {Objectives. To understand changes in how Facebook pages frame vaccine
   opposition.
   Methods. We categorized 204 Facebook pages expressing vaccine
   opposition, extracting public posts through November 20, 2019. We
   analyzed posts from October 2009 through October 2019 to examine if
   pages' content was coalescing.
   Results. Activity in pages promoting vaccine choice as a civil liberty
   increased in January 2015, April 2016, and January 2019 (t{[}76] = 11.33
   {[}P < .001]; t{[}46] = 7.88 {[}P < .001]; and t{[}41] = 17.27 {[}P <
   .001], respectively). The 2019 increase was strongest in pages
   mentioning US states (t{[}41] = 19.06; P < .001). Discussion about
   vaccine safety decreased (r(s){[}119] = -0.61; P < .001) while
   discussion about civil liberties increased (r(s){[}119] = 0.33; Py <
   .001]). Page categories increasingly resembled one another (civil
   liberties: r(s){[}119] = -0.50 {[}P < .001]; alternative medicine:
   r(s){[}84] = -0.77 {[}P < .001]; conspiracy theories: r(s){[}119] =
   -0.46 {[}P < .001]; morality: r(s){[}106] = -0.65 {[}P < .001]; safety
   and efficacy: r(s){[}119] = -0.46 {[}P < .001]).
   Conclusions. The ``Disneyland{''} measles outbreak drew vaccine
   opposition into the political mainstream, followed by promotional
   campaigns conducted in pages framing vaccine refusal as a civil right.
   Political mobilization in state-focused pages followed in 2019.
   Public Health Implications. Policymakers should expect increasing
   attempts to alter state legislation associated with vaccine exemptions,
   potentially accompanied by fiercer lobbying from specific celebrities.},

Title = {Exploiting Non-Cooperative Game Against Cache Pollution Attack in
   Vehicular Content Centric Network},

Abstract = {Vehicular Content Centric Network (VCCN) has been proposed to address
   the issues of user mobility and sporadic connectivity in Vehicular Ad
   hoc Network (VANET). The in-network caching of VCCN can indeed improve
   the performance of content distribution in terms of cache hit and
   delivery latency by making each node store frequently accessed data.
   However, data caching unfortunately suffers from Cache Pollution Attack
   (CPA) that sends out fabricated requests to pollute the data cache. To
   prevent the degradation of network performance caused by such an attack,
   we propose a detection and defense scheme for CPA by adopting game
   theory. We model the attack scenario into a non-cooperative game model.
   First, we prove the non-existence of pure strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE)
   in the attacker and defender game, and propose a normal form game model
   with complete information and an extensive Bayesian form game model with
   incomplete information. Under the guidance of NE, we propose a
   punishment strategy to prevent the conspiracy attack and make the
   attackers behave normally. Moreover, we propose a cooperative detection
   scheme to give the Road Side Unit (RSU) the final decision on CPA based
   on the direct and indirect suspicious lists which are generated by each
   node according to the observed traffic pattern. Simulation evaluations
   demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art schemes in
   terms of cache hit, detecting ratio, and cache accuracy for detecting
   and defending CPA.},

Title = {The \#VaccinesWork Hashtag on Twitter in the Context of the COVID-19
   Pandemic: Network Analysis},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Vaccination is one of the most successful public health
   interventions for the prevention of COVID-19. Toward the end of April
   2021, UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund),
   alongside other organizations, were promoting the hashtag
   \#VaccinesWork.Objective: The aim of this paper is to analyze the
   \#VaccinesWork hashtag on Twitter in the context of the COVID-19
   pandemic, analyzing the main messages shared and the organizations
   involved.Methods: The data set used in this study consists of 11,085
   tweets containing the \#VaccinesWork hashtag from the 29th to the 30th
   of April 2021. The data set includes tweets that may not have the
   hashtag but were replies or mentions in those tweets. The data were
   retrieved using NodeXL, and the network graph was laid out using the
   Harel-Koren fast multiscale layout algorithm.Results: The study found
   that organizations such as the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and
   Gavi were the key opinion leaders and had a big influence on the spread
   of information among users. Furthermore, the most shared URLs belonged
   to academic journals with a high impact factor. Provaccination users had
   other vaccination-promoting hashtags in common, not only in the COVID-19
   scenario.Conclusions: This study investigated the discussions
   surrounding the \#VaccinesWork hashtag. Social media networks containing
   conspiracy theories tend to contain dubious accounts leading the
   discussions and are often linked to unverified information. This kind of
   analysis can be useful to detect the optimal moment for launching health
   campaigns on Twitter.},

Abstract = {In the profession of ministry what do we intend to do and how do we do
   it? Dallas Willard's conviction was that the ministry's aim is the
   transformation of persons. In the last 30 years of his life, Willard
   spent many hours in many settings and countries, teaching vocational
   ministers on the philosophy of ministry. In 1999's The Divine
   Conspiracy, he famously advocated for the development of curricula of
   Christlikeness for Western churches which, presumably, were devoid of
   them. Without a clear understanding of Willard's theology of God and the
   soul, his call to developing a curriculum of Christlikeness is apt to
   sound like crafting an experientialist discipleship program with a
   built-in multiplication scheme and a polished presentation. One of the
   realities that mitigates against such programs' success, taught Willard,
   is the importance of the minister's mind, heart, and body to the
   transformational process of others. Another is the incredible value of
   another person's will within God's eternal purposes. A third reality is
   the uncircumventable priority of the mind in human personality. Most
   importantly, a minister, according to Willard, must serve out of an
   abundance of grace, out of the availability of the kingdom of God to
   them and through them. Therefore, ministry's aim of transformation
   requires the presence, above all, of teachers of Christlikeness, of the
   sort that Dallas Willard himself aimed to be.},

Abstract = {The rise of digital platforms has provided an opportunity for an
   unprecedented expansion of the public sphere; however, the recent
   proliferation of online disinformation, automated propaganda as well as
   hate speech has substantially hampered their potential to become an
   instrument for more egalitarian and participatory communication in a
   democratic society. In many countries, the ascent of right-wing populism
   in recent years has been associated with the establishing of an
   alternative information environment that includes a variety of fringe
   news websites that frequently engage in spreading rumours, hoaxes and
   conspiracy theories. Attempting to fill the gap in the scholarship that
   predominantly tends to focus on the US and Western European political
   and media context, this article aims to map the disinformation ecosystem
   and its audiences in the Czech Republic, a country where the online
   disinformation scene has been particularly active in recent years.
   Following an outline of the evolution of the Czech media system over the
   course of the last three decades, this study utilises data from the
   2018-2020 Digital News Report surveys to provide empirical insights into
   the characteristics of the consumers of the most prominent
   disinformation news websites in the Czech Republic. In conclusions, the
   paper evaluates the challenges these new patterns of (dis)information
   consumption pose for the post-transition public sphere in the Czech
   Republic, especially in context of the processes of democratic
   deconsolidation and the rise of illiberalism.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the digital is perceived as an ecosystem extremely
   expropriated by the fashion industry. It has changed its rules of
   communication and consumption. This era has witnessed an inconstancy
   growing among the consumer's scale. Who used to be a regular follower
   has become a concrete producer on the fashion industry and refers now to
   the spaces on some blogs that became for him an expositional spot, a
   source of connection and even an inspiring birthplace for an eventual
   business. This spot typically known as a kind of advertising which
   before was verbally transmitted where the trendency and the design's
   interaction used as a device to communicate, became now a fashion
   district of the conspiracy and conducting rules on advertising. The
   leading power of Fashion bloggers seduce the fashion field and attract
   further brands for collaboration and partnership. It is therefore
   mandatory to keep updated and at the same pace as the followers whom
   perceived as potential customers. The fashion blog drive us to reflect
   on the most timely way and rethink the place of this media in the way of
   sharing and producing the brand's advertising speech. How does the
   digital express fashion language? What are the new orientation's lines
   followed on the communication and advertising techniques? This
   digression is devoted to study the design of a logbook based on a
   semiotic approach focused on the analysis of photos, texts and videos.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the connections of Franz Schubert's operatic
   works with the French musical theater of its time. These connections are
   stipulated by that significant position which was obtained in
   German-speaking lands during the first two decades of the 19th century.
   In Schubert's works for the stage, just as in operas by other Austrian
   and German composers of that time, there are many features present which
   are characteristic of French genre models. The article examines, among
   other things, points of connection between two of his operas, ``Alfonso
   und Estrella{''} and ``Fierrabras{''} with ``Semiramis{''} by Charles
   Simon Catel, which was staged in Viennese opera theaters, and which, as
   it is known, Schubert was fascinated with. This confluence is
   characterized, first of all, by the characteristic punctured rhythmical
   formulas, which in all three operas approach the functions of leitmotifs
   in their significance, some melodic turns and the specific harmonic
   progression bringing in the connection between the Aria of Azema from
   ``Semiramis{''} with the Chorus of Florinda from ``Fierrabras.{''} A
   certain amount of impact was also exerted by Catel's ``Semiramis{''} on
   the libretto of ``Alfonso und Estrella.{''} It is possible that one of
   the scenes of the latter opera - the conspiracy scene - was brought in
   the general outline of the subject under the influence of the French
   examples, moreover that particularly in the music of this scene one can
   discern the greatest amount of connections with the analogous episode in
   Catel's opera.},

   CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS OF MILITARY JURISDICTION},
Journal = {WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Number = {4},
Pages = {681-748},
Abstract = {This Article addresses an important but undertheorized question in
   existing jurisprudence and scholarship: the proper role of international
   law in determining the constitutional line between Article III courts
   and military commissions. This Article makes two principal arguments.
   First, it explains why, as a normative matter, international law should
   inform the permissible scope of military commission jurisdiction.
   Second, this Article describes the functional value of international law
   in resolving the difficult line-drawing problems between military and
   Article III courts compared with other possible regulatory tools.
   Current litigation over military commission prosecutions at Guantanamo
   has focused on whether ex post facto principles prohibit military
   commissions from exercising jurisdiction over offenses such as material
   support for terrorism and conspiracy that do not violate international
   law and, therefore, were not prohibited by statute when committed. It
   leaves open the important question whether the United States can
   prosecute those offenses under the Military Commissions Act of 2006
   based upon conduct that post-dates that statute's enactment. The U.S.'s
   position is that such prospective prosecution of non-international law
   violations is permissible because the offenses violate a separate body
   of jurisprudence known as the U.S. common law of war. This Article
   critiques this theory by providing a formal and functional analysis of
   the continuing relevance of international law as a constitutional limit
   on military jurisdiction. It further supplies a framework for
   understanding international law's role in constitutional analysis more
   generally.},

Abstract = {IntroductionThe present study explores the reasons of those who have not
   been vaccinated in the later stage of the vaccine rollout in Spain and
   its associated determinants. MethodsCluster and logistic regression
   analyses were used to assess differences in claimed reasons for vaccine
   hesitancy in Spain using two samples of unvaccinated people (18-40 years
   old) gathered by an online cross-sectional survey from social networks
   (n = 910) and from a representative panel (n = 963) in October-November
   2021. ResultsThe main reasons for not being vaccinated were believing
   that the COVID-19 vaccines had been developed too fast, they were
   experimental, and they were not safe, endorsed by 68.7\% participants in
   the social network sample and 55.4\% in the panel sample. The cluster
   analysis classified the participants into two groups. Logistic
   regression showed that Cluster 2 (individuals who reported structural
   constraints and health-related reasons such as pregnancy or medical
   recommendation) presented a lower trust in information from health
   professionals, had a lower willingness to get vaccinated in the future,
   and avoided less social/family events than those in Cluster 1 (reasons
   centered in distrust on COVID-19 vaccines, conspiracy thoughts and
   complacency). ConclusionsIt is important to promote information
   campaigns that provide reliable information and fight fake news and
   myths. Future vaccination intention differs in both clusters, so these
   results are important for developing strategies target to increase
   vaccination uptake for those who do not reject the COVID-19 vaccine

Abstract = {Objective. - To evaluate the presence of vaccine criticism on the French
   Web and to analyze strategies and arguments used by opponents of
   vaccination.
   Methods. - The most frequently used keywords associated with the terms
   ``vaccination{''} and ``vaccine{''} on Google.fr in September 2013 were
   identified and searched for individually on Google.fr. The links
   presented in the first three pages of results were reviewed to identify
   the most frequent providers of information. The proportion of critical
   content was determined by website type and a content analysis was
   performed.
   Results. - The main preoccupations about vaccination were general
   concerns; < 1\% of searches were guided by negative keywords.
   Institutional websites, healthcare websites, news websites and
   anti-vaccine websites were the most frequent providers of results. The
   proportion of anti-vaccine websites among the results was 11\% for a
   neutral search and 24\% for a search guided by negative keywords.
   Critical content was observed in other types of website. Six major
   strategies and categories of arguments used by opponents of vaccination
   were identified: the manipulation of science, the use of shocking images
   and an appeal to emotions via testimonies, a general vaccination
   conspiracy, the individual's freedom of choice not respected, an
   unnatural act and a negative benefit/risk balance.
   Conclusion. - It seems important to monitor online vaccination debates,
   to develop an institutional presence that meets the needs of Internet
   users and to help them develop a critical view. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson

Title = {A Secure Authentication System-Using Enhanced One Time Pad Technique},

Abstract = {With the upcoming technologies available for hacking, there is a need to
   provide users with a secure environment that protect their resources
   against unauthorized access by enforcing control mechanisms. To
   counteract the increasing threat, enhanced one time pad technique has
   been introduced. It generally encapsulates the enhanced one time pad
   based protocol and provides client a completely unique and secured
   authentication tool to work on. This paper however proposes a hypothesis
   regarding the use of enhanced one time pad based protocol and is a
   comprehensive study on the subject of using enhanced one time pad
   technique. This forms the basis for a secure communication between the
   communicating entities. Several password authentication protocols have
   been introduced each claiming to withstand to the several attacks,
   including replay, password file compromise, denial of service, etc. We
   introduced a new protocol through which the people can communicate to
   each other securely using one time pads. In this technique, very small
   one time pad is needed for both the sender and receiver and then they
   can have a very secure communication between them, so the server which
   is providing the communication between sender and receiver will also do
   not have any knowledge about the way to decrypt the text. This protocol
   is providing the secure communication by not trusting anyone except the
   sender and receiver which are the only one having the copy of small one
   time pad file. Therefore, the proposed scheme is secure and efficient
   against notorious conspiracy attacks.},

Year = {1999},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {53-64},
Abstract = {In order to examine the clinical characteristics of delusional
   parasitosis in a large sample, 102 cases were collected from the
   Japanese literature reported so far. There were 30 patients with
   somatically-based psychosis, 12 with endogenous psychosis, 7 with
   induced psychosis, and 53 with pure delusional parasitosis. Age at
   onset, clinical features, CT and EEG findings, therapy, course, and
   prognosis were compared between the pure type and the other groups.
   The majority of patients fell ill after the age of 50. A sex difference
   (with a predominance of females) was found only in pure delusional
   parasitosis. The pure type patients often insisted that they actually
   saw the parasites (43\%), regarded skin particles or the like as
   parasites (42\%), and the parasites had personalities (23\%). Half of
   the pure type patients had some CT and EEG findings, and 82\% of those
   with some CT findings and 78\% of those with some EEG findings claim to
   have seen parasites. As for the course, they were mainly phasic, not
   always chronic and progressive. These pure-type patients sometimes had
   delusions of persecution and self-reference experiences, and considered
   infestation by parasites to be part of a conspiracy against them.
   They often had symptoms thought to be schizophrenic, and also often
   yielded some biological findings. Therefore, a nosological
   classification of these patients should be postponed, and both
   psychopathological and biological studies should be carried out
   continuously from now on.},

Abstract = {John Courtney Murray S.J. was the chief architect of the Vatican Council
   Document, Dignitatis Humanae (1966). He also made a distinctive
   contribution to domestic and foreign policy debates in the United States
   in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s - ranging from government financial
   support to Catholic schools to U.S. foreign policy with the Soviet
   Union. In these debates, Murray nuanced the historical critical method
   he developed in his scholarly analysis of the Church/State tradition and
   the writings of Leo XIII. Murray's method of public argument is uniquely
   suited to a religiously pluralist, secular society. This article exposes
   his method of public argument with references to issues of controverted
   morality like abortion.},

Title = {Vaccination Readiness of COVID-19 and Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Among
   Young Adults: The Mediated Role of Health and Wellbeing},
Journal = {ANNALS OF KING EDWARD MEDICAL UNIVERSITY LAHORE PAKISTAN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: The significance and seriousness of COVID-19 vaccination are
   regarded as a public health emergency for national and international
   forums. Despite this fact, vaccination readiness is a challenge in young
   adults due to their belief in general conspiracy theories.Objective: The
   prime objective of the study was to explore the relationship between
   vaccination readiness and generic conspiracist beliefs in young
   adults.Method: A correlational research design was used to conduct this
   research study. A total sample of 185 young adults (male=83, female=102)
   aged (20-39 years) fulfilling the inclusion criteria were purposively
   recruited from different areas of Lahore, Pakistan. An online survey was
   conducted having demographic information form and standardized questions
   about vaccination readiness, generic conspiracist beliefs, and health
   and well-being. The link was sent to the participants through email,
   WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social media channels.
   During this survey participants recorded their responses in around ten
   weeks. Results: Data were analyzed by utilizing SPSS-23 and AMOS-21. The
   results of correlation analysis revealed that vaccination readiness was
   inversely associated with generic conspiracist beliefs in young adults.
   Moreover, generic conspiracist beliefs have a significant negative
   impact on vaccination readiness. Health and well-being partially
   mediated the association between generic conspiracist beliefs and
   vaccination readiness.Conclusion: The authorities should initiate
   awareness programs to enhance the readiness of the COVID-19 vaccination
   and also metastasize its effectiveness in young adults. Preventive
   measures should be taken to eradicate the elements that enhance the
   generic conspiracist beliefs about vaccination.},

Title = {Fear and Derision: A Quantitative Content Analysis of Provaccine and

Journal = {HEALTH EDUCATION \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {46},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1012-1023},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to examine the characteristics of Internet
   memes created and disseminated by proponents and opponents of
   vaccinations. A quantitative content analysis was performed on 234 pro-
   and antivaccine memes culled from the vaccination fan pages with the
   greatest number of followers on Facebook. Coding variables included
   whether the meme was pro- or antivaccine, percentage of factually
   incorrect claims, mention of the out-group, persuasive appeals (emotion,
   fear, and rationality), degree of sarcasm, and number of reactions and
   shares. The most prevalent themes concerned vaccine-preventable
   diseases, vaccine injury/safety/autism, and conspiracy theories.
   Independent t tests indicated that provaccination memes were more likely
   to use sarcasm whereas antivaccination memes were more likely to contain
   emotion and fear appeals and inaccurate claims. The percentage veracity
   of the claims in each meme was fact-checked using authoritative
   scientific sources. A path analysis applying structural equation
   modeling revealed that memes containing characteristics that were
   antivaccine (vs. provaccine), appealed to emotion, and appealed to
   rationality significantly contributed to greater likelihood of social
   media reactions and shares. Additional analysis determined that both
   pro- and antivaccination memes tended to contain more gist than verbatim
   information, and both groups did not significantly differ on this
   gist-to-verbatim variable. Findings offer insights to understand the
   persuasion tactics that provaccine and antivaccine groups apply in memes
   to persuade others via social media. Understanding these techniques will
   enable the development of health communication strategies to combat
   false and damaging vaccine information disseminated on the Internet.},

Abstract = {Medical communication in Western-oriented countries is dominated by
   concepts of shared decision-making and patient autonomy. In interactions
   with Roma patients, these behavioral patterns rarely seem to be achieved
   because the culture and ethnicity have often been shown as barriers in
   establishing an effective and satisfying doctor-patient relationship.
   The study aims to explore the Roma's beliefs and experiences related to
   autonomy and decision-making process in the case of a disease with poor
   prognosis. Forty-eight Roma people from two Romanian counties
   participated in semi-structured interviews, conducted by a research team
   from the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Iasi. Participants were
   recruited among the chronically ill patients and caregivers. The Roma
   community opposes informing the terminal patients about their condition,
   the ``silence conspiracy{''} being widely practiced. The family fully
   undertakes the right of decision making, thus minimizing the patient's
   autonomy. We identified ethical dilemmas concerning autonomy, lack of
   patients' real decision-making power, and paternalistic attitudes
   exerted firstly by the family and, on demand, by the physician. Instead,
   the Roma patient benefits from a very active support network, being
   accompanied at the hospital by numerous relatives. The patient's right
   to make autonomous decisions promoted in the Western countries and
   stipulated by the Romanian law has diminished value in the Roma
   community. For the Roma, the understanding of dignity is not simply
   individual and personal, but it is closely related to their cultural
   particularities. Ignoring their cultural values could create conflicts
   between healthcare providers and community.},

Title = {Satan has come to Rietfontein': Race in South Africa's Satanic Panic},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {753-767},
Abstract = {In the late 1980s and early 1990s, as the apartheid system was falling
   apart, white South Africa was gripped by a powerful moral panic that
   played out, often hysterically, in the newspapers and magazines of the
   time. This Satanism scare revolved around fears of a large-scale
   conspiracy of evil that mostly involved white youth, and that threatened
   the spiritual health and even the continued existence of white South
   Africa. Rape, murder, cannibalism and all manner of atrocities involving
   virgins, animals and babies were commonly said to be part of Satanist
   rituals occurring across the country. Satanists, South Africans were
   told, were everywhere, and were as great a threat to their nation as
   communists. This article uses contemporary press material to examine
   three isolated yet related incidents within the scare: the Orso murder
   trial in 1992, when a teenager and her boyfriend claimed satanic
   possession as the motivation for the murder of her mother; the case of
   the Rietfontein slasher, also in 1992, when a group of white schoolgirls
   was apparently tormented by a supernatural force; and a single article
   about the alleged possession of a large number of black students in a
   school in the Atteridgeville township in 1989. It uses these three
   episodes to reveal how the Satanism scare was violently racialised, how
   the possibility of magic was both legally and culturally reserved for
   whites and how many white South Africans' literal fear of the devil fed
   into recurrent discursive narratives about black pathology and white
   responsibility.},

Title = {Perspectives on union corruption: Lessons from the databases},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LABOR RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Most of the surprisingly small number of studies of union corruption
   done over the years have focused either on longitudinal analysis of
   particularly aggressive unions in their prime or on the relationship
   between union leaders and organized crime characters who have acquired
   middle names in quotes. Since the 1930s, these studies have usually been
   based on prosecutorial initiatives of federal or state agencies seeking
   to rein in Mafia, Cosa Nostra, or Outfit crime families for whom control
   of unions has been a major income source, not the unions, themselves. I
   use two new, recently available data sources that allow an overview of
   the whole spectrum of union corruption, that quantify it, and that
   differentiate certain aspects of it from the corruption found in other
   societal organizations. My analysis reveals that union corruption is
   both broadly practiced and multifaceted, with some forms having brutal
   ancient antecedents not yet completely lost while others are new and not
   yet completely developed. Only a few are broadly shared with businesses
   or other societal organizations. Overall, I identify 25 separate
   categories of significant union corruption and find that among these
   embezzlement remains the most common, but kickbacks and malfeasance with
   respect to pension plan management are of much greater financial
   concern. Peculation associated with gaining and maintaining high union
   office together with the bloated perks and emoluments that obtain
   thereto fuel internal corruption without diminishing the practice of
   extortion, bribery, conspiracy, selling labor peace, licensing loose
   contracts, selling job access, and other traditional external corrupt
   practices. All are a blight on organized labor.},

Title = {Mental health consequences of COVID-19 media coverage: the need for
   effective crisis communication practices},
Journal = {GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {During global pandemics, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
   crisis communication is indispensable in dispelling fears, uncertainty,
   and unifying individuals worldwide in a collective fight against health
   threats. Inadequate crisis communication can bring dire personal and
   economic consequences. Mounting research shows that seemingly endless
   newsfeeds related to COVID-19 infection and death rates could
   considerably increase the risk of mental health problems. Unfortunately,
   media reports that include infodemics regarding the influence of
   COVID-19 on mental health may be a source of the adverse psychological
   effects on individuals. Owing partially to insufficient crisis
   communication practices, media and news organizations across the globe
   have played minimal roles in battling COVID-19 infodemics. Common
   refrains include raging QAnon conspiracies, a false and misleading
   ``Chinese virus{''} narrative, and the use of disinfectants to
   ``cure{''} COVID-19. With the potential to deteriorate mental health,
   infodemics fueled by a kaleidoscopic range of misinformation can be
   dangerous. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of research on how to
   improve crisis communication across media and news organization
   channels. This paper identifies ways that legacy media reports on
   COVID-19 and how social media-based infodemics can result in mental
   health concerns. This paper discusses possible crisis communication
   solutions that media and news organizations can adopt to mitigate the
   negative influences of COVID-19 related news on mental health.
   Emphasizing the need for global media entities to forge a fact-based,
   person-centered, and collaborative response to COVID-19 reporting, this
   paper encourages media resources to focus on the core issue of how to
   slow or stop COVID-19 transmission effectively.},

Abstract = {The author studies the academic activity of Dzhuchi M. Tugan-Baranovsky,
   defines the sphere of his academic interests, gives the characteristic
   of his major works. The special attention is paid to the analysis of the
   works devoted to the formation of the political regime of Napoleon
   Bonaparte and identifying the endowment made by the historian in
   studying the history of French studies in Russia.
   D. M. Tugan-Baranovsky attached great importance to the period of the
   Consulate, stressing the prevalence of the Napoleon's regime at that
   time. In this period the real opposition, both from the side of the
   royalists and Republicans was eliminated. Based on an extensive range of
   sources the historian analyzed various attempts of drafting a Republican
   conspiracy against Napoleon. The historian explored major
   transformations of the period of the Consulate: the reorganization of
   the financial system, judicial reform, establishment of the new
   administrative system and its subsequent evolution. He noted that the
   complex reforms of Napoleon were not only the political but also of
   great social importance. D. M. Tugan-Baranovsky claimed that Napoleon's
   regime had much more connection with the inner end of the bourgeois
   revolution than it appeared in the Soviet literature.
   In recent years D. M. Tugan-Baranovsky has addressed issues of social
   and economic history of Russia in the late 19th - early 20th centuries
   and the study of political and scientific activities of his grandfather
   M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky. The author of the article shows what aspects of
   the work of the scientist-economist have attracted the attention of D.
   M. Tugan-Baranovsky.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the existing academic literature and what it tells
   us about organised crime and fraud, both at a national and an
   international level. With a traditional focus from enforcement on
   organised crime groups (OCGs) involved in drugs and firearms, it is
   argued that comparatively little is known about OCGs involved in fraud.
   This imbalance is reflected in the paucity of empirical research in this
   area, although this picture is slowly changing. This chapter explores
   the historically contested definitions of organised crime, outlines the
   definition adopted in this book, and presents views on the extent of the
   `threat' posed by OCGs. Further, it looks at the scale of fraud in the
   UK and the policing response. The chapter concludes with a national
   overview of what the OCG mapping data, held by the National Crime Agency
   (NCA) in the UK, tells us about economic organised fraudsters.},

Abstract = {Despite the fact that COVID-19 vaccines serve as an important tool for
   protection against COVID-19 infection, in individuals aged above 65
   years, as well as the entire community, there are significant problems
   associated with getting vaccinated. The aim of this study is to
   determine the effect of perceptions and attitudes toward the COVID-19
   epidemic in individuals over the age of 65 living in Sanliurfa, Turkey
   in 2021, on the situation of having COVID-19 vaccination. The study is
   designed as a case-control type of research. The study population was
   comprised of individuals aged 65 years and above located in Sanliurfa,
   Turkey. The Case Group consisted of individuals, who rejected the
   COVID-19 vaccination and the Control Group consisted of individuals who
   have received the vaccine. The individuals recruited in the Case and
   Control Groups were selected by means of the snowball sampling method.
   The study included a total of 240 individuals including 120 in the Case
   Group and 120 in the Control Group. Rate of vaccine rejection was higher
   in individuals who believed that the media exaggerated the pandemic, the
   disease had low contagiousness, the pandemic was a conspiracy, the
   environmental pollution had no role in the disease, the domestic
   measures taken against the epidemic were inadequate, the personal
   hygiene could not protect from disease, and who did not believe that the
   disease was inevitable {[}p < 0.05]. Governments have a lot of
   responsibilities in providing accurate information about vaccination to
   people and increasing confidence in the health system.},

Title = {Sourcing and Automation of Political News and Information During Three
   European Elections},
Journal = {SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Voters increasingly rely on social media for news and information about
   politics. But increasingly, social media has emerged as a fertile soil
   for deliberately produced misinformation campaigns, conspiracy, and
   extremist alternative media. How does the sourcing of political news and
   information define contemporary political communication in different
   countries in Europe? To understand what users are sharing in their
   political communication, we analyzed large volumes of political
   conversation over a major social media platform-in real-time and native
   languages during campaign periods-for three major European elections.
   Rather than chasing a definition of what has come to be known as ``fake
   news,{''} we produce a grounded typology of what users actually shared
   and apply rigorous coding and content analysis to define the types of
   sources, compare them in context with known forms of political news and
   information, and contrast their circulation patterns in France, the
   United Kingdom, and Germany. Based on this analysis, we offer a
   definition of ``junk news{''} that refers to deliberately produced
   misleading, deceptive, and incorrect propaganda purporting to be real
   news. In the first multilingual, cross-national comparison of junk news
   sourcing and consumption over social media, we analyze over 4 million
   tweets from three elections and find that (1) users across Europe shared
   substantial amounts of junk news in varying qualities and quantities,
   (2) amplifier accounts drive low to medium levels of traffic and news
   sharing, and (3) Europeans still share large amounts of professionally
   produced information from media outlets, but other traditional sources
   of political information including political parties and government
   agencies are in decline.},

Title = {Laughing at the victims: the function of popular jokes during Algeria's
   `Dark Decade,' 1991-2002},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NORTH AFRICAN STUDIES},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {A decade-long civil conflict that leaves an estimated 200,000 people
   dead is no laughing matter. Yet, throughout Algeria's `dark decade' of
   the 1990s residents of the war-torn North African country told jokes.
   Previous scholarship on humour during this period has asserted that
   Algerians overwhelmingly used comedy to shore up resistance against the
   political agents, namely the military, government, and armed rebels
   whose actions arguably incited the violence. However, a survey of the
   nearly one hundred jokes in Algerian or Modern Standard Arabic, French,
   and Tamazight that circulated around the country during this period
   showed that Algerian civilians primarily used jokes to laugh at
   themselves, the victims of horrendous violence, and not the military or
   armed `Islamist' groups responsible for the crisis. By portraying
   civilians as powerless these jokes inadvertently attributed a strength
   to the belligerents that often exceeded their actual prowess. This
   myth-propounding about the war's major actors was not without
   consequence. Paul Silverstein has asserted that Algerian conspiracy
   theories regarding which side of the conflict committed its worst
   atrocities served the purposes of both the military as well as the armed
   `Islamist' organisations (Interview with Zineb Sedira). I argue that
   jokes did much the same, proving that humour in times of conflict can
   have devastating results. This finding challenges the notion of war-time
   humour in the context of `the dark decade' operating mainly as a
   Scottsian `weapon of the weak,' a tool of the disenfranchised and
   downtrodden to lambast powerful figures.},

Title = {Electronic Structures and Mechanical Properties of Boron and Boron-Rich
   Crystals (Part I)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUPERHARD MATERIALS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Boron and boron-rich crystals are hard materials, which have unique
   properties compared with other hard materials, such as diamond. Various
   ways of the arrangement of icosahedra yield many complicated crystal
   polymorphs and their derivatives. Although the crystals are basically
   hard, these are internally flexible for the mechanical and chemical
   properties. This flexibility is a consequence of conspiracy between the
   soft part and the hard part of the structure. The soft part is conveyed
   by the icosahedral unit, and the hard part is by the bonds connecting
   icosahedra. This article attempts to provide a consistent description
   for the unique characters of boron and boron-rich solids from the
   electronic-structure calculations. Recent developments of the
   first-principles calculation provide significant contributions to our
   understanding of the unusual properties of this class of materials. In
   particular, a combination of high-pressure experiment is successful in
   providing convincing evidence for our understanding, while it gives rise
   to unforeseen developments, such as discovery of superconductivity.
   Throughout analyses of many properties of boron solids, care is repeated
   for the effects of special arrangement of atoms and atom relaxation for
   those of complicated structures, which otherwise would mislead our
   intuitive interpretations. Special emphasize is placed on the phase
   stability and phase transitions at high pressure, because of recent
   successive discoveries of novel hard materials, such as.
   gamma-orthorhombic boron and diamond-like BC5 compound. The first part
   of this review describes the ground state of boron and boron-rich
   crystals. The energy gap, native defects, and phonon properties are
   discussed.},

Title = {ON THE CREATION OF A LEGAL MECHANISM FOR ``PUSHING{''} GERMANY TO THE
   EAST IN 1925},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the process of forming and revealing
   the essence of the legal mechanism for ``pushing{''} Germany on to the
   East, which was established in 1925 as a result of the decisions of the
   Locarno Conference. The source is the historiography of the Soviet
   period, in which the terms ``legal mechanism{''} and
   ``Versailles-Locarno system{''} have not been previously used. The final
   documents of the Paris Peace Conference formed the so-called Versailles
   international legal system, which by definition was spearheaded against
   the Soviet Russia. Among other things, that system obliged Germany to
   pay large monetary reparations for winner countries and defined new
   borders of the states, but Article 19 of the Charter of the League of
   Nations provided for the change of state borders peacefully. At the same
   time it was assumed that with time the Versailles system would be
   supplemented by a system of guarantees. Initially, the possible scenario
   was dictated by the desire of Britain and France to divide Soviet Russia
   into spheres of their influence; however, after the collapse of these
   intentions, the initiative was captured by British diplomacy. Its secret
   memorandum contained a veiled program of action for the near future in
   the European international scene. Winners and losers were to conspire
   against Moscow, sacrificing the interests of small countries - Poland
   and Czechoslovakia. Britain was to direct the process. A favorable
   moment for the beginning of the program implementation came in 1923,
   when France was facing the threat of isolation in connection with the
   occupation of Ruhr after Germany delayed its payment of reparations.
   London came to help Berlin, the so-called ``Committee of Experts{''} was
   established, which soon began to literally impose its will on European
   governments, including Paris. This became possible because the
   ``Committee{''} was thalassocratic at its core and in its composition,
   i.e. it was represented by financiers from England and the United
   States, to whom France had debts after the First World War. This fact
   favored the implementation of the planned scenario - an international
   conspiracy against the Soviet Union. Its essence was to supplement the
   Versailles system with a system of warranties that would include a legal
   mechanism for pushing Germany to the East. Director of the Bank of
   England M. Norman and director of the Federal Reserve System of the US
   B. Strong played an important role. The legal registration of the
   conspiracy against the Soviet Union took place at the Locarno Conference
   in October 1925, when a number of international legal documents were
   initialed. A subject for unconditional execution was the so-called Rhine
   Pact, i.e. the guarantee agreement between Germany, Belgium, France,
   Great Britain and Italy. It made the western border of Germany
   immutable. Poland and Czechoslovakia were not included in the Rhine
   Pact; therefore, they did not fall under the collective guarantee of
   countries led by London. Instead, they signed arbitration contracts,
   which obliged Warsaw and Prague to regulate the border with Germany,
   thus opening its way to the East. Thus, the Versailles system was
   supplemented by a guarantee system, and became the Versailles-Locarno
   one, which also included a legal mechanism for pushing Germany to the
   East. The role of an arbitrator was reserved by the United Kingdom.},

Abstract = {The presence at Uganda's 1980 general elections of a Commonwealth
   Observer Group might be seen as a seminal moment. This was the first
   formal international observation of polls in a sovereign African state
   and the precursor of multiple similar missions that later became
   routine. Yet the 1980 mission sits uneasily in the history of election
   observation. The observers endorsed the results despite evidence of
   malpractice, and Uganda plunged into civil war within months.
   Internationally, the mission is now either forgotten or treated as an
   embarrassment. Within Uganda, it has been denounced as part of an
   outsider conspiracy to foist an unwanted president on an unwilling
   people. This article argues that the 1980 mission was neither entirely
   seminal nor an aberration, and that both the elections and observation
   were driven partly by actors within Uganda rather than simply imposed by
   outsiders. The availability of UK government records allows us to see
   the events of 1980 as a particularly clear example of a recurring
   ``observers' dilemma.{''} Ideally, elections combine democracy and
   state-building. They offer people a choice as to who will lead or
   represent them, and at the same time they assert through performance a
   crucial distinction between a capable, ordering state and a law-abiding
   citizenry. Yet these two aspects of elections may be in tension; a poll
   that offers little or no real choice may still perform ``stateness{''}
   through substantial, orderly public participation. When that happens in
   what would now be called a ``fragile state,{''} should international
   observers denounce the results?},

Abstract = {The Svalbard Global Seed Vault provides a backup of seed collections
   from genebanks around the world. It's unique character has made it
   iconic in the public imagination as a `Noah's Ark' for crop plants. Its
   remote location and strict controls on access have, however, also lent
   it an air of mystery, swirling with conspiracy theories. In this paper,
   I first clarify the aims of the Vault, the history of its development
   and the policies and practices of its current operation. Given concerns
   around its potential links to the biotechnology industry, I go on to ask
   whether GM crops are currently stored in the Vault. Presenting several
   reasons for why GM crops are formally excluded, while indicating the
   potential for both change and unintentional contamination, I am
   compelled to question whether GM crops should be excluded. Answering
   this requires an interrogation of their potential conservation value as
   modern contributors to crop biodiversity. In exploring this issue, I
   suggest that there has been surprisingly little discussion of the moral
   status and conservation value of bio-technological crop plants and
   indeed, of how we care for all the techno-lifeforms we are currently
   engaged in co-creating. I suggest that these are becoming important
   issues as biotechnological techniques and applications begin to rapidly
   evolve and diversify (e.g. through genome editing and synthetic
   biology). Emphasizing the scope for a refreshed interdisciplinary
   research agenda exploring the interface between biotechnology and
   biodiversity conservation, I conclude the article by proposing new
   concepts of synbiodiversity and symbiodiversity to encourage further
   debate.},

Title = {Information About England in 1551-1554 According to the Final Report of
   the Venetian Ambassador Giacomo Soranzo},

Abstract = {The article attempts to find out the specificity of the information
   gained by Venetian noble Giacomo Soranzo (1518-1599) during his
   diplomatic mission to England in 1551-1554. While in London the Venetian
   ambassador became an eye-witness of changing the monarchs on the English
   throne. Having arrived to England in the reign of Edward VI (1547-1553),
   he saw the king's death, Lady Jane's conspiracy and accession to the
   throne of Mary I (1553-1558). When he came back home, Giacomo Soranzo
   produced a report about his diplomatic mission to the Doge and the
   Venetian Senate. In his report the Venetian ambassador attracted the
   Venice government's attention to the features of the geographical
   position of England, its natural resources, climate, its main brands in
   the sphere of agriculture and industry, besides he gave characteristics
   of the English State history and its major institutions such as
   parliament, judicial system, the house of the English King. In his
   report Giacomo Soranzo particularly marked out incomes and expenses of
   the English crown. His report also contains information about everyday
   life of the English society. The Venetian diplomat gave portrait
   characteristics of the members of the English royal family, as well as
   high-ranking persons of the English state. The author of the article
   analyses the relazione (final report) of Giacomo Soranzo to the Venetian
   Senate and comes to conclusion that in his report the Venetian
   ambassador presented the information connected with socio-economic and
   socio-political features of the development of England in 1551-1554.},

Title = {Twitters' Concerns and Opinions About the COVID-19 Booster Shots:
   Infoveillance Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER HEALTH ON THE INTERNET},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to categorize and analyze the public
   response toward third/booster shots of COVID-19 on Twitter. Methods: We
   downloaded the COVID-19 vaccine booster shots related Tweets using the
   Twitter API. The collected Tweets were pre-processed to prepare them for
   analysis by (1) removing non-English language tweets, retweets, emojis,
   emoticons, non-printable characters, the punctuation marks, and the
   prepositions, (2) anonymizing the identity of the users, and (3)
   normalizing various forms of the same words. We used the
   state-of-the-art BertTopic modeling library to identify the most popular
   topics. Results: Of 165,048 Tweets collected, 36,908 Tweets were
   analyzed in this study. From these tweets, we identified 9 topics, which
   were about Biden administration, Pfizer \& BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson \&
   Johnson, eligibility for booster shots, side effects, Donald Trump,
   variants of the Novel Coronavirus, and conspiracy theory \& propaganda.
   The mean of sentiment was positive in all topics. The lowest and highest
   mean of sentiments were for the Donald Trump topic (0.0097) and the
   Johnson \& Johnson topic (0.1294), respectively. Conclusions: The topics
   identified in this study not only accurately reflect the contemporary
   COVID-19 discussion, but also the high degree of politicization in the
   USA. While the latter might be a result of our rejection of non-English
   tweets, it is reassuring to see our fully automated, unsupervised
   pipeline reliably extract such global features in the data at scale. We,
   therefore, believe that the methodology presented in this study is
   mature and useful for other infoveillance studies on a wide variety of
   topics.},

Journal = {SSM-POPULATION HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: We examined occupational disparities in COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy in Japan. Methods: Cross-sectional online surveys were
   conducted among of residents living in Iwate Prefecture from July 2 to 4
   and from October 1 to 3 in 2021 (total n=17,914). Intention to get
   vaccinated for COVID-19 was assessed by self-report questions. We
   calculated odds ratios for vaccine hesitancy among occupational groups
   using logistic regression models controlling for covariates and
   stratified by age and sex groups. Results: The overall prevalence of
   vaccine hesitancy was 5.5\% in our sample of working-age adults. Women <
   40 years were also 1.6 times more likely to be vaccine hesitant, citing
   concerns about adverse effects on pregnancy or breastfeeding. Among
   people aged 40-59 years, workers in the service industry, manufacturing
   industry, and the unemployed were significantly more likely to have
   perceived vaccine hesitancy regardless of sex. Young service workers
   viewed themselves as being more vulnerable to risk of infection but less
   susceptible to getting severe disease, whilst exhibiting low levels of
   vaccine knowledge. Middle-aged (40-59 years) workers in the
   manufacturing industry underestimated both vulnerability to infection
   and disease severity, as well as demon-strated low knowledge of vaccines
   and practice of preventive measures. Conclusions: While complex and
   heterogeneous reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy have been cited in
   Western countries (e.g., mistrust of government, medical mistrust, and
   conspiracy beliefs), the situation in Japan may be more amenable to
   educational interventions targeting specific occupations. Policymakers
   should target interventions for increasing vaccine readiness in high
   risk occupations.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the discourse around the Covid-19
   pandemic to investigate the widespread polarisation evident in social
   media debates. The model of epidemic psychology holds that initial
   adverse reactions to a new disease spread through linguistic
   interaction. The main argument is that the mediation of the pandemic
   through social media has fomented the effects of epidemic psychology in
   the reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic by providing continued access to
   commentary and linguistic interaction. This social interaction in the
   absence of any knowledge on the new disease can be seen as a discourse
   of knowledge production, conducted largely on social media. This view,
   coupled with a critical approach to the power relations inherent in all
   processes of knowledge production, provides an approach to understanding
   the dynamics of polarisation, which is, arguably, issue-related and not
   along common ideological lines of left and right. The paper critiques
   two discursive structures of exclusion, the terms science and conspiracy
   theory, which have characterised the knowledge production discourse of
   the Covid-19 pandemic on social media. As strategies of dialogic
   contraction, they are based on a hegemonic view of knowledge production
   and on the simplistic assumption of an emancipated position outside
   ideology. Such an approach, though well-intentioned, may ultimately
   undermine social movements of knowledge production and thus threaten the
   very values it aims to protect. Instead, the paper proposes a
   Foucauldian approach that problematises truth claims and scientificity
   as always ideological and that is aware of power as inherent to all
   knowledge production.},

Abstract = {The emergence of COVID-19, caused by novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,
   became a pandemic in just 10 weeks. Without effective medications or
   vaccines available, authorities turned toward mitigation measures such
   as use of face masks, school's closings, shelter-in-place, telework and
   social distancing. People found refuge on the internet and social media
   apps; however, there was a proliferation of instant messaging containing
   hoaxed, deliberate misleading information: fake news messaging (FNM).
   The aim of this study was to assess FNM through content analysis and to
   discriminate them in a proposed taxonomy structure. A sample of
   convenience of messages, memes, tweets or cartoons in several languages
   was selected from the most popular social media outlets, i.e. Facebook,
   WhatsApp, Twitter etc. More than 300 FNM were identified. Descriptive
   statistics were used for highlighting potential relationships between
   variables. Content analysis determined that FNM could be divided into
   Health- and non-health-related types. There are several sub-types
   considering, but not limited to, religious beliefs, politics, economy,
   nutrition, behaviors, prevention of the infection, the origin of the
   disease and conspiracy theories. The parallel FNM pandemic affected the
   response from an already debilitated public health system through the
   confusion created in the community and the erosion in the credibility of
   genuine media. Public health practitioners had to face people's
   unpredictable behaviors, panic, tensions with the communities and, in
   some cases, a hostile climate toward frontline workers. Public health
   practitioners must adjust ongoing and future health promotion and
   education interventions including plans to neutralize fake news
   messages.},

Abstract = {The year 2014 marked the twentieth anniversary of the assassination of
   Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the ruling Partido
   Revolucionario Institucional / Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
   The impact of this event on perceptions of the PRI and the Mexican
   political system has prevailed within the public imaginary, and
   continues to fuel conspiracy theories in relation to the possible
   motives for the candidate's assassination. This article examines a
   filmic exploration of this traumatic moment in recent Mexican history,
   an event that changed the way the nation viewed its then President,
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari's, and subsequent PRI governments. At this
   moment the public mood was transformed, from a prevailing sense of false
   security, driven by the dictums of neoliberal policies under the banner
   of Salinismo, to a state of shock and fear of a society spiralling into
   increasing violence and an economic downturn, with repercussions for
   years to follow. Framing Colosio: el asesinato (Colosio: the
   Assassination) within discourses of the thriller genre, and borrowing
   from theoretical notions of conspiracism', I explore the significance of
   Carlos Bolado's film in light of the timing of its release (prior to the
   2012 presidential elections), and the contents of its narrative.
   Moreover, the article explores the role of history and fiction in this
   detective story, alongside the way in which film as a medium processes
   traumatic events. Ultimately, I examine how the film's metanarrative
   format provides the exploratory premise from which to access otherwise
   un-visualized and complex theories surrounding the case.},

Title = {High Acceptability and Perceived Feasibility of Long-Acting Injectable
   Antiretroviral Treatment Among People Living with HIV Who Are Viremic

Abstract = {Long-acting injectable antiretroviral treatment (LAI ART), such as a
   bimonthly injection of cabotegravir/rilpivirine, is a promising HIV
   treatment option. LAI ART may particularly benefit people who are
   reluctant to initiate or are poorly adherent to daily oral pills and not
   virally suppressed. However, the acceptability and feasibility of LAI
   ART among individuals with viremia in Africa has not been well studied.
   We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with 38 people living with
   HIV with viral load >= 1000 copies/mL and 15 medical and nursing staff,
   and 6 focus group discussions with peer health workers, to examine
   acceptability and feasibility of LAI ART in south-central Uganda.
   Transcripts were thematically analyzed through a team-based framework
   approach. Most people living with HIV reacted positively toward LAI ART
   and endorsed interest in taking it themselves. Most felt LAI ART would
   make adherence easier by reducing the challenge with remembering daily
   pills, particularly in the context of busy schedules, travel, alcohol
   use, and dietary requirements. Participants also appreciated the privacy
   of injections, reducing the likelihood of stigma or inadvertent HIV
   serostatus disclosure with pill possession. Concerns about LAI ART
   included side effects, perceived medication effectiveness, fear of
   injection, and medical mistrust and conspiracy beliefs. Health workers
   and participants with viremia also noted health system challenges, such
   as stockouts and monitoring treatment failure. However, they felt the
   health system could overcome these challenges. Implementation
   complexities must be addressed as LAI ART is introduced and expanded in
   Africa to best support viral suppression and address HIV care continuum
   gaps.},

Abstract = {Prisoners form a population who are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to
   overcrowding, limited movement, and a poor living environment.
   Consequently, there is a need to ascertain the status of COVID-19
   vaccination and factors associated with hesitancy among prisoners. A
   cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was undertaken among prisoners
   at three district jails in Punjab Province, Pakistan. A total of 381
   prisoners participated and none of the study participants had received
   an influenza vaccine this year. In total, 53\% received at least one
   dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with the majority having two doses. The top
   three reasons of vaccine acceptance were ``fear of contracting
   SARS-CoV-2 infection{''} (56.9\%), ``desire to return to a pre-pandemic
   routine as soon as possible{''} (56.4\%), and ``having no doubts on the
   safety of COVID-19 vaccines{''} (39.6\%). There was no statistically
   significant difference (p > 0.05) in any demographic variables between
   vaccinated and unvaccinated prisoners except for age, which was strongly
   association with COVID-19 vaccine uptake (\& chi;(2)(3) = 76.645, p <
   0.001, Cramer's V = 0.457). Among the unvaccinated prisoners (N = 179),
   only 16 subsequently showed willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
   The top three reasons for hesitancy were: COVID-19 is not a real
   problem/disease (60.1\%), safety concerns (51.1\%), and COVID-19 vaccine
   is a conspiracy (50.3\%). Efforts are needed to address their concerns
   given this population's risks and high hesitancy rates, especially among
   younger prisoners.},

Abstract = {The cosmic abundance of the He-3 isotope has important implications for
   many fields of astrophysics. We are using the 8.665GHz hyperfine
   transition of He-3(+) to determine the He-3/H abundance in MilkyWay H II
   regions and planetary nebulae. This is one in a series of papers in
   which we discuss issues involved in deriving accurate He-3/H abundance
   ratios from the available measurements. Here we describe the ionization
   correction we use to convert the He-3(+)/H+ abundance, y(3)(+), to the
   He-3/H abundance, y(3). In principle the nebular ionization structure
   can significantly influence the y(3) derived for individual sources. We
   find that in general there is insufficient information available to make
   a detailed ionization correction. Here we make a simple correction and
   assess its validity. The correction is based on radio recombination line
   measurements of H+ and He-4(+), together with simple core-halo source
   models. We use these models to establish criteria that allow us to
   identify sources that can be accurately corrected for ionization and
   those that cannot. We argue that this effect cannot be very large for
   most of the sources in our observational sample. For a wide range of
   models of nebular ionization structure we find that the ionization
   correction factor varies from 1 to 1.8. Although larger corrections are
   possible, there would have to be a conspiracy between the density and
   ionization structure for us to underestimate the ionization correction
   by a substantial amount.},

Title = {Athletes as heroes and role models: an ancient model},
Journal = {SPORT ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-51},
Abstract = {A common argument for the social value of sport is that athletes serve
   as heroes who inspire people - especially young people - to strive for
   excellence. This argument has been questioned by sport philosophers at a
   variety of levels. Not only do athletes seem unsuited to be heroes or
   role models in the conventional sense, it is unclear more generally what
   the social and educational value of athletic excellence could be. In
   this essay, I construct an argument for the social and educational value
   of sport built upon the relationship between athletes, heroes, and the
   song culture that celebrated them in ancient Greece. On this model,
   athletes are neither heroes nor role models in the conventional sense.
   Rather, athletes, athletics, and the poets who extolled them were part
   of a cultural conspiracy to celebrate and inspire virtue (arete) by
   connecting a community with its heroic past. Festivals such as the
   Olympic Games, but also local events such as funeral games, educated and
   unified communities by cultivating an aesthetic appreciation for virtue
   and by inspiring youth to strive for it. Ancient athletes were not
   heroes, rather they re-enacted heroic struggles, thereby experiencing
   heroic virtues, and inspiring both artists and spectators to bond with
   the higher ideals implied by their shared belief in divine ancestry. In
   this way, athletes, athletics, and the media that celebrated them played
   important social and educational roles. Insofar as modern sport performs
   a similar service, its association with heroism and with moral education
   may ultimately be justified.},

Abstract = {We present a survey, using the Chandra X-ray observatory, of the central
   gravitating mass profiles in a sample of 10 galaxies, groups and
   clusters, spanning similar to 2 orders of magnitude in virial mass. We
   find the total mass distributions from similar to 0.2 to 10R(e), where
   R(e) is the optical effective radius of the central galaxy, are
   remarkably similar to power-law density profiles. The negative
   logarithmic slope of the mass density profiles, alpha, systematically
   varies with R(e), from alpha similar or equal to 2, for systems with
   R(e) similar to 4 kpc to alpha similar or equal to 1.2 for systems with
   R(e) greater than or similar to 30 kpc. Departures from hydrostatic
   equilibrium are likely to be small and cannot easily explain this trend.
   We show that the conspiracy between the baryonic (Sersic) and dark
   matter (Navarro-Frenk-White/Einasto) components required to maintain a
   power-law total mass distribution naturally predicts an anti-correlation
   between alpha and R(e) that is very close to what is observed. The
   systematic variation of alpha with R(e) implies a dark matter fraction
   within R(e) that varies systematically with the properties of the galaxy
   in such a manner as to reproduce, without fine tuning, the observed tilt
   of the Fundamental Plane. We speculate that establishing a nearly
   power-law total mass distribution is therefore a fundamental feature of
   galaxy formation and the primary factor which determines the tilt of the
   Fundamental Plane.},

Abstract = {The territory of the Lublin region at the turn of October and November
   1918 was occupied by two countries - Germany (southern Podlasia) and
   Austria. Lublin was the see of the general Austrian governor. With
   regard to the military aspect the taking over of power in Lublin was
   decisive for the recapture of independence in the territory of the
   Austrian partition. The key role in this action was played by the Polish
   Military Organisation (Pol. POW), the organisation then in conspiracy,
   and a battalion of the Polish Armed Forces earlier under German command;
   the battalion arrived in Lublin in the beginning of November 1918.
   Soldiers and officers then in the Austrian army had also declared their
   intention of joining the Polish army; they were released from their oath
   by virtue of the Austrian head of the armed forces. In the first days of
   November 1918 the Polish army took over bloodlessly a complete control
   of Lublin. At that time the Poles from the Austrian army, remaining in
   the remaining garrisons of Austrian occupation, established Polish
   authorities with the support of the local cells of POW. In Podlasia the
   situation was more complicated because Germans were not willing to hand
   down power in garrisons, despite the fact that war activities had ended
   in Europe on 11(th) November 1918. Military clashes, often bloody,
   erupted (Miedzyrzec Podlaski). The eastern administrative units of
   Podlasia as late as January 1919 came under Polish jurisdiction after
   the German army had completely evacuated the Ukraine and moved by train
   from Briest to East Prussia.},

Title = {NIGERIAN SOLDIERS ON THE WAR AGAINST BOKO HARAM},

Abstract = {This study explores two main questions: What are the experiences of
   soldiers who have fought against Boko Haram? What can these experiences
   teach us about the seeming incapacity of the Nigerian military to defeat
   Boko Haram? Six major themes are explored. These are perspectives on the
   mission, morale of troops, military equipment and weapons, suicide and
   murder-suicide among troops, intelligence leaks, and relationships of
   troops with the Civilian Joint Task Force, an extralegal militia.
   Soldiers' discourses on the mission against Boko Haram reveal three
   overlapping dimensions. First, there are suspicions about the sponsors
   and political godfathers of Boko Haram. This suggests a belief that Boko
   Haram is a conspiracy involving the government and top brass of the
   military. Second, the patronage system involved in deployment into key
   positions on the war front. Third, participants believe that the war is
   being deliberately prolonged because it is a moneymaking machinery for
   the political and military elites. The evidence suggests that
   availability of weapons varies by unit and the agency of
   commanders-their networks and influence within the military and
   willingness to disobey orders from superiors if their demands are not
   met. This situation produces radically variegated wartime experiences
   among troops. Non-commissioned soldiers believe senior commissioned
   officers perpetrate intelligence leaks and are responsible for the
   protracted war. Senior Army Generals interviewed in this study support
   this perspective. The study has major policy implications for successful
   operations against Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin area and the
   broader war against terrorism in the Sahel.},

Title = {`Victim playing' as a form of verbal aggression in the Czech parliament},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AGGRESSION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {81-107},

Abstract = {As the core of political discourse is the struggle for power and scarce
   resources, conflict seems to be an essential component of political
   action and interaction. In addition, conflicts in parliament are
   manifested in many different ways. They range from disputes during the
   plenary sessions to more personal attacks in the question time. This
   paper, however, examines an atypical display of parliamentary discourse,
   namely a speech by a social democratic MP David Rath, which regarded a
   vote on his extradition and was delivered on 5 June 2012. This speech
   obviously did not fulfil the primary function of the parliamentary
   sessions, i.e. legislating and decision-making. Here the MP was given
   the opportunity to present his own version of events and ask fellow MPs
   to maintain his parliamentary immunity. The analysis revealed two
   intertwining discourse strategies. On the one hand, the MP who is
   charged with several criminal acts presents himself as a victim of a
   conspiracy. In that, he aims to divert attention from the criminal case
   while calling for sympathy and providing self-justification. On the
   other hand, he uses his time to verbally complain about his arrest, the
   conditions in which he is held in custody, and the people he holds
   responsible for his current situation; he uses verbal attacks to
   undermine and disqualify a number of overt and covert enemies. The key
   aim of the analysis is to explore how victimhood is constructed in
   discourse, what discourse strategies are observable at the macro-level
   and how they are reflected in the discourse structure and in the
   linguistic style.},

Title = {Genetically modified organisms and the age of (Un) reason? A critical
   examination of the rhetoric in the GMO public policy debates in Ghana},
Journal = {FUTURES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {83},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {37-49},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Using narrative policy analysis we examined the adversarial rhetoric of
   claims-makers in their bid to undermine alternative and conflicting
   accounts of GMOs as environmental and human health risk and to forestall
   any challenges to the scientific authority of the technological
   deterministic account of the GMO policy debates in Ghana. The study
   shows that the GMO discourse was built with the rhetorical frames of
   smallholder farmer vulnerability and entitlement used in the account it
   contradicts, thereby legitimating its own appeal for responsive
   remedies. Civil society claims attacked GMOs as discriminatory and as an
   environmental and human health risk. Government and scientists engaged
   in unsympathetic counter rhetorical strategies in hopes of debunking or
   neutralizing the claim made by civil society. In other words, Government
   and scientists were denying the claim that GMO was discriminatory and
   posed significant human health risk, as well as the call to action to do
   something about GMOs. Civil society adapted the counter rhetoric of
   insincerity, claiming that scientists had some kind of ``hidden
   agenda{''} behind their claim, such as eagerness to just earn money from
   their patents on GMOs. It is imperative that communication on GMOs
   includes the underlying assumptions, the uncertainties and the
   probabilities associated with both best and worst case scenarios. This
   is a necessary condition to minimise misinformation on GMOs but may be
   insufficient to completely erase conspiracy theories from the minds of
   the public especially when scientists and government are perceived to be
   biased towards multinational corporations that are ostensibly
   preoccupied with making profits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Wei Te-Sheng's Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale (2011) represents
   the Musha Incident, a violent event when the Seediq, a tribe of
   Taiwanese aborigines, rose in revolt against their Japanese colonizers.
   Reviewing the tragedy exclusively from the scope of the tribe, Wei
   demonstrates that the incident was not so much caused by the
   colonization as most historical, cultural and visual texts represent it,
   as it was the result of a realization of Gaya, an ancient custom that
   every Seediq was disciplined to follow. Battle scenes, images of cherry
   blossom and the use of voice-over repetitively appear in the film. The
   repetition not only illuminates the significance of Gaya but also
   indicates that conflict could lead to collaboration. An analysis of the
   battle scenes, for instance, shows that the conflict was not always
   between the colonizers and the colonized but sometimes among the Seediq
   themselves. Out of self-interest, some of the Seediq choose to conspire
   with their invaders. Through portraying such conspiracy, Wei emphasizes
   the differences among the Seediq as individuals. However, perceiving the
   body and voice of the Seediq, we should pay attention to the
   intervention of the director. In the final scene, a group of Seediq
   warriors realize the ascent to a promised rainbow bridge. Romanticizing
   the Gaya practice, the director shows that these once-silenced
   aborigines eventually could articulate themselves in public realms. Yet,
   such romantic portrayal of the historical moments could incite
   ``epistemic violence{''} against the aborigines, as Spivak may suggest.},

Title = {Post Conflict Normalization through Trade Preferential Agreements:
   Egypt, Israel and the Qualified Industrial Zones},
Journal = {PEACE ECONOMICS PEACE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Trade and economic cooperation are often promoted through policy to
   facilitate post-conflict normalization. The Qualified Industrial Zone
   (QIZ) model of duty and quota-free industrial regions is a policy tool
   initiated by the United States as a brokerage in promoting peace between
   Israel and its Arab neighbors. Indeed, a vast literature aims to
   evaluate the economic and political potential of trade liberalization.
   Yet the mechanisms of trade policy implementation in a postconflict
   environment, its timing and underlying political motives, are critical
   but rather neglected factors, which design the prospects of trade
   incentives. We therefore question the effectiveness of the QIZ as a tool
   addressing post-conflict dynamics and ask whether its impact on
   Israel-Egyptian relations reflects the value of this policy or the
   circumstances of its implementation. Using mixed methods, this study
   presents and evaluates the implementation of the QIZ in Egypt since 2004
   and its results, both economic and political, fine tuning the broader
   debate to focus on circumstances of implementation. This case study
   demonstrates the results of trade opportunity implementation as a
   reaction to threat rather than mobilization to realize post-conflict
   rapprochement or even to reap economic opportunity. Notwithstanding the
   forces of globalization, Egypt's pre and postrevolutionary internal
   political economy and delicate relations with Israel serve as the
   context for understanding the QIZ. This context facilitates
   contradicting political interpretations, with the QIZ simultaneously
   celebrated as an economic success, criticized as an Egyptian escape
   route from structural reforms, and accused as embodying a U.S.-Egyptian
   elite conspiracy, to coerce Egyptian economic normalization with Israel.},

Abstract = {The article offers a critical analysis of the cognitive science of
   religion (CSR) as applied to new and quasi-religious movements, and
   uncovers implicit conceptual and theoretical commitments of the
   approach. A discussion of CSR's application to new religious movement
   (NRM) case studies (charismatic leadership, paradise representations,
   Ahmadiyya, and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness)
   identifies concerns about the theorized relationship between CSR and
   wider socio-cultural factors, and proposals for CSR's implication in
   wider processes are discussed. The main discussion analyses three themes
   in recent work relating CSR to religious and religion-like activities
   that extend and reframe the model. These include (1) identification of
   distinctive and accessible cognitive pathways associated with new forms
   of religious belief and practice (in particular in `New Age' movements),
   (2) application of CSR to movements and practices outside traditional
   definitions of religion (near death experiences, conspiracy theories,
   virtual reality), and (3) engaging CSR in wider cultural processes and
   negotiations (religion in healthcare settings, and the definition of the
   study of esoteric religious traditions within academic domains). The
   conclusion identifies two particular findings: (1) that application of
   CSR in these areas renders underlying cognitive processes more available
   to scrutiny and (2) that CSR is employed to identify and enlarge the
   category of religion. The conclusion suggests that the study of CSR in
   its application to NRMs and quasi-religion identifies a wide field of
   common and overlapping themes and interests in which CSR is a more
   active operand than is commonly assumed.},

   Interpretations and analogies in foreigners' reports on the cossack

Abstract = {The article examines the reports of European contemporary authors about
   the uprising of Stepan Razin in 1667-1671, and their attempts to
   interpret the rebels' motives. The main focus lies on the comparisons
   drawn by the observers between Razin's rebellion and other European
   insurrections of the Early Modern period. The sources in question are
   broadsheets, newspapers, pamphlets and books, i.e. those printed media
   genres which constituted and influenced the Early Modern public sphere.
   Three perception tendencies can be traced in the Razin discourse of the
   1670s. First, the tendency to describe Razin as an ally of the Turkish
   Sultan, the Crimean Khan or the Persian Shah, and thus to depict the
   rebellion of the Don-Cossacks as part of the Oriental threat to the
   Christian world. The second view on Razin tended to show him as a `noble
   bandit', i.e. an insurgent who nevertheless strove to protect the
   oppressed from the evildoings of the Russian elite. Finally, after the
   execution of Razin in June 1671 and the distribution of the official
   death-sentence, which was soon even translated into several European
   languages, Razin began to be perceived primarily as a conspirator
   against the state and a separatist. His revolt was then put on par with
   the other contemporary separatist movements in East Central and Eastern
   Europe (the Ukrainian revolt of hetman Doroshenko in 1667-1674, and the
   Croatian-Hungarian magnate conspiracy against the Habsburgs in
   1670-1671). These rivaling views were reflected not only in textual
   descriptions, but also in images of Razin, which were circulated in
   various ways.},

Abstract = {In order to be able to raise the question of the ``world{''} today in an
   effective way, we have to reactivate the Goethean categories of
   Weltliteratur and Weltschmerz for a critique of our own historical
   moment. We need to understand the phenomenon of Weltschmerz as a symptom
   of the impossibility of Weltliteratur. Going beyond the context of the
   original formulation of these categories, we could argue that something
   akin to the historical phenomenon of Weltschmerz emerges every time the
   ideological constitution of the world threatens to fail. Today, we live
   in an age of a generalised state of cultural disorientation that has
   produced its own Weltliteratur, which includes a wide range of
   discourses about the ``world{''} - from officially endorsed theories of
   economic globalisation, to scientific treatises on the Anthropocene,
   environmental protest movements, philosophical pamphlets, all the way to
   world-historical conspiracy theories. Yet, an anxiety concerning the
   impossibility of world-formation in general is also recorded in these
   documents. In order to be able to capture our contemporary Weltschmerz,
   the article turns to the young Walter Benjamin's suggestion that the
   task of this age is to produce an ``objective{''} (rather than
   subjective) Weltschmerz. However, the most effective tools to
   conceptualise this objective Weltschmerz come from the traditions of
   philosophical acosmism. It is a notable philosophical development of our
   times that some elements of the acosmic tradition have recently
   resurfaced in speculative realism. Thus, speculative realism could be
   described as a possible site of our contemporary Weltschmerz: its
   acosmic metaphysics is repeatedly tamed by a mournful longing for the
   world.},

Abstract = {Social media is an important source of news and information in the
   United States. But during the 2016 US presidential election, social
   media platforms emerged as a breeding ground for influence campaigns,
   conspiracy, and alternative media. Anecdotally, the nature of political
   news and information evolved over time, but political communication
   researchers have yet to develop a comprehensive, grounded, internally
   consistent typology of the types of sources shared. Rather than chasing
   a definition of what is popularly known as ``fake news,{''} we produce a
   grounded typology of what users actually shared and apply rigorous
   coding and content analysis to define the phenomenon. To understand what
   social media users are sharing, we analyzed large volumes of political
   conversations that took place on Twitter during the 2016 presidential
   campaign and the 2018 State of the Union address in the United States.
   We developed the concept of ``junk news,{''} which refers to sources
   that deliberately publish misleading, deceptive, or incorrect
   information packaged as real news. First, we found a 1:1 ratio of junk
   news to professionally produced news and information shared by users
   during the US election in 2016, a ratio that had improved by the State
   of the Union address in 2018. Second, we discovered that amplifier
   accounts drove a consistently higher proportion of political
   communication during the presidential election but accounted for only
   marginal quantities of traffic during the State of the Union address.
   Finally, we found that some of the most important units of analysis for
   general political theory-parties, the state, and policy
   experts-generated only a fraction of the political communication.},

Abstract = {Fake news is a major threat to global democracy resulting in diminished
   trust in government, journalism and civil society. The public popularity
   of social media and social networks has caused a contagion of fake news
   where conspiracy theories, disinformation and extreme views flourish.
   Detection and mitigation of fake news is one of the fundamental problems
   of our times and has attracted widespread attention. While fact checking
   websites such as snopes, politifact and major companies such as Google,
   Facebook, and Twitter have taken preliminary steps towards addressing
   fake news, much more remains to be done. As an interdisciplinary topic,
   various facets of fake news have been studied by communities as diverse
   as machine learning, databases, journalism, political science and many
   more.
   The objective of this tutorial is two-fold. First, we wish to
   familiarize the database community with the efforts by other communities
   on combating fake news. We provide a panoramic view of the
   state-of-the-art of research on various aspects including detection,
   propagation, mitigation, and intervention of fake news. Next, we provide
   a concise and intuitive summary of prior research by the database
   community and discuss how it could be used to counteract fake news. The
   tutorial covers research from areas such as data integration, truth
   discovery and fusion, probabilistic databases, knowledge graphs and
   crowdsourcing from the lens of fake news. Effective tools for addressing
   fake news could only be built by leveraging the synergistic relationship
   between database and other research communities. We hope that our
   tutorial provides an impetus towards such synthesis of ideas and the
   creation of new ones.},

Title = {HENRY VII'S LETTER TO CARLISLE IN 1498: HIS CONCERNS ABOUT RETAINING IN
   A BORDER FORTRESS},
Journal = {NORTHERN HISTORY},

Volume = {54},

Pages = {149-166},
Abstract = {Henry VII's reign has been the subject of increased study in recent
   years, in particular his relationship with the nobility and his
   determination to ensure the loyalty of his subjects. Henry VII was adept
   at utilising the numerous methods at his disposal in order to keep his
   crown. This article makes a contribution to this broader understanding
   of Henry VII's reign by focusing on one document, a letter to the city
   of Carlisle dated 15 February 1498, which ordered that the statutes
   relating to retaining and the distribution of liveries should be upheld.
   While the letter has been noted by previous historians, it has not been
   the subject of a detailed examination. This article explains the
   significance of the document for understanding the reign of Henry VII,
   his attitude towards retaining and the relationship between royal and
   urban governments in the late fifteenth century. This particular letter
   includes two novel features not found in other letters to towns about
   retaining. First, there is an explicit reference to the possibility of a
   Scottish invasion. Second, the city's government were all required to
   swear oaths of fealty to Henry VII. Although the letter confirms the
   general picture that Henry VII was keen to remind his subjects of their
   duties and obligations to the Crown and that he built on and adapted
   Yorkist innovations, it highlights his specific concern in early 1498,
   in the aftermath of the Perkin Warbeck conspiracy, that James IV of
   Scotland might still invade.},

   Social Support on Embitterment during the COVID-19 Pandemic},

Abstract = {There are indications for a raise in embitterment during the COVID-19
   pandemic. As embitterment is related to felt social exclusion,
   pessimism, and a proneness toward COVID-19-related conspiracy beliefs,
   embitterment may be a key factor to consider in the current pandemic.
   However, perceived social support (PSS), which is associated with hope
   during the COVID-19 pandemic could serve as an important resilience
   factor for bitterness. We therefore investigated the effects of PSS on
   embitterment in aftermath of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   52 individuals participated in our follow-up online study in October
   2020 (T1) and May 2021 (T2). Embitterment (measured with the Berne
   Embitterment Inventory) and PSS were repeatedly assessed at T1 and T2. A
   double moderation analysis was conducted, using the PROCESS macro to
   examine the effects of embitterment, PSS, and age on embitterment 6
   months later. The results suggest that the prediction of embitterment at
   T2 by embitterment at T1 was altered by changes in PSS. Here, in
   particular participants with high embitterment at T1 and a gain in PSS
   had higher embitterment scores at T2, whereas participants with low
   embitterment were found to have lower embitterment scores. This
   interaction effect was further influenced by the age of the
   participants, where the effects were more pronounced among middle-aged
   participants than younger participants. As embittered individuals seem
   to grow in bitterness with a gain in PSS, support is found for the
   notion that embittered individuals seeking allies supporting their
   mindset.},

   reconsidering moderation},

Abstract = {This article examines the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB) movement's
   stand on the South Sudan question. The aim here is to contribute to the
   ongoing debate over the MB's moderation. Throughout the civil war in
   Sudan, the MB consistently objected to South Sudanese secession. Yet,
   while it had traditionally framed its objection in religious terms,
   describing the South Sudanese struggle as a Christian conspiracy against
   Islam, in the decade preceding South Sudan's declaration of independence
   it moved to base its opposition on more practical grounds, revolving
   around issues such the absence of democracy, stability and
   infrastructure in South Sudan. This correlated with wider shifts in the
   MB. Since the 1990s, the movement has claimed to have undergone a
   transformation, adopting a moderate, pro-democratic stance. These
   statements persuaded many scholars that the MB has come to represent
   political moderation in both its domestic and international agenda. More
   recent works on the movement, however, have come to question the MB's
   moderation hypothesis, suggesting that even though the movement has
   changed its discourse and some aspects of its activism, this could not
   be seen as a linear process of moderation. This article uses the South
   Sudan case to further support this critique from a foreign policy
   perspective. It demonstrates that even though the MB changed its tactics
   and discourse, its goals remained unchanged even when the circumstances
   and the normative environment changed dramatically. Moreover, it shows
   that at times of crisis, the liberal discourse gave way to the
   old-fashioned radical discourse of previous decades.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Surveys have shown that many people now turn to the
   Internet for health information when making health-related decisions.
   This study systematically analyzed the HPV vaccine information returned
   by online search engines. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted
   disease and is the leading cause of cervical cancers.
   Methods: We conducted a content analysis of 89 top search results from
   Google, Yahoo, Bing, and Ask.com. The websites were analyzed with
   respect to source, tone, information related to specific content
   analyzed through the lens of the Health Belief Model, and in terms of
   two content themes (i.e., conspiracy theories and civil liberties). The
   relations among these aspects of the websites were also explored.
   Results: Most websites were published by nonprofit or academic sources
   (34.8\%) and governmental agencies (27.4\%) and were neutral in tone
   (57.3\%), neither promoting nor opposing the HPV vaccine. Overall, the
   websites presented suboptimal or inaccurate information related to the
   five behavioral predictors stipulated in the Health Belief Model.
   Questions related to civil liberties were present on some websites.
   Conclusion: Health professionals designing online communication with the
   intent of increasing HPV vaccine uptake should take care to include
   information about the risks of HPV, including susceptibility and
   severity. Additionally, websites should include information about the
   benefits of the vaccine (i.e., effective against HPV), low side effects
   as a barrier that can be overcome, and ways in which to receive the
   vaccine to raise individual self-efficacy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {OSPAR's exclusion of rigs-to-reefs in the North Sea},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {57-61},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article focuses on how the debate over the deep-water disposal of
   offshore oil and gas installations has been central to shaping North Sea
   artificial reef policy. Through a close empirical historical study, this
   article reconstructs how Greenpeace's protest of the deep-water disposal
   of the Brent Spar spurred the exclusion of rigs-to-reefs (the conversion
   of obsolete offshore oil and gas structures into artificial reefs) as a
   viable decommissioning option by the primary international treaty
   organization with jurisdiction over North Sea waters, the Oslo-Paris
   Commission (OSPAR). During OSPAR's artificial reef guideline
   development, several OSPAR contracting parties implied that there is a
   conspiracy among oil companies to use rigs-to-reefs as a cover for
   evading the deep-water disposal rules, although they never presented
   evidence to back up these claims. In the face of pressure to ``close the
   loophole{''} for deep-water disposal and in spite of scientific
   objection. OSPAR's final guidelines excluded all non-virgin materials as
   acceptable reef construction materials, essentially banning
   rigs-to-reefs. Because a significant number of steel offshore
   installations will be decommissioned in North Sea waters in the decade
   and the most up-to-date science has concluded that manmade deep-water
   reefs may be beneficial to some species including threatened cold-water
   coral, this article suggests that OSPAR revise its guidelines.
   Rigs-to-reefs should be not categorically excluded; a case-by-case
   determination of the suitability of a structure for reuse as an
   artificial reef would be most appropriate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Social Worldviews Predict the General Factor of Paranormal and Generic
   Conspiracist Beliefs},
Journal = {SPANISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Month = {JUN 26},
Abstract = {Even though wide access to any warranted information in the modern age,
   the problem of unfounded belief is still relevant, since these beliefs
   often lead to negative consequences (e.g., vaccination refusal,
   homeopathic treatment, etc.). The aim of this study was testing the
   relationship of social worldviews with paranormal beliefs and conspiracy
   beliefs. We assumed dimensionality hypothesis based on functional
   standpoint that there should be a general factor (underlying all the
   domains of paranormal beliefs and generic conspiracist beliefs), which
   has associations with the social worldviews as well. Derived our
   analysis from the survey of 228 participants (M-age = 30.6, SD = 11.7),
   we found that (a) the structure of paranormal and generic conspiracist
   beliefs can be described by a bifactor model; (b) the general factor of
   paranormal and generic conspiracist beliefs in the bifactor model was
   positively associated with global belief in just world and dangerous
   worldview; (c) paranormal beliefs were positively associated with global
   belief in just world and negatively associated with competitive
   worldview; (d) generic conspiracist beliefs were positively associated
   with dangerous worldview, competitive worldview, and zero-sum game
   belief; (e) contrary to our hypotheses, there was no evidence for any
   negative association of paranormal beliefs with dangerous worldview or
   zero-sum game belief and for any negative association of generic
   conspiracist beliefs with global belief in just world. We claim that the
   unfounded beliefs can be of some functional nature, demonstrating a
   connection with social worldviews, which opens up new perspectives for
   considering this problem within the framework of social psychology.},

Title = {COVID-19 fake news diffusion across Latin America},
Journal = {SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Fact-checking verifies a multitude of claims and remains a promising
   solution to fight fake news. The spread of rumors, hoaxes, and
   conspiracy theories online is evident in times of crisis, when fake news
   ramped up across platforms, increasing fear and confusion among the
   population as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. This article explores
   fact-checking initiatives in Latin America, using an original
   Markov-based computational method to cluster topics on tweets and
   identify their diffusion between different datasets. Drawing on a
   mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods, including time-series
   analysis, network analysis and in-depth close reading, our article
   proposes an in-depth tracing of COVID-related false information across
   the region, comparing if there is a pattern of behavior through the
   countries. We rely on the open Twitter application programming interface
   connection to gather data from public accounts of the six major
   fact-checking agencies in Latin America, namely Argentina (Chequeado),
   Brazil (Agencia Lupa), Chile (Mala Espina Check), Colombia (Colombia
   Check from Consejo de Redacciin), Mexico (El Sabueso from Animal
   Polotico) and Venezuela (Efecto Cocuyo). In total, these profiles
   account for 102,379 tweets that were collected between January and July
   2020. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of online information
   dissemination beyond the national level and demonstrates how politics
   intertwine with the health crisis in this period. Our method is capable
   of clustering topics in a period of overabundance of information, as we
   fight not only a pandemic but also an infodemic, evidentiating
   opportunities to understand and slow the spread of false information.},

Title = {How disinformation operations against Russian opposition leader Alexei
   Navalny influence the international audience on Twitter},
Journal = {SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING},

Abstract = {Previous research dedicated a lot of effort to investigation of the
   activities of the Internet Research Agency, a Russia-based troll
   factory, as well as other information operations. However, those studies
   are mostly focused on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Brexit, and
   other major international political events. In this study, we have
   attempted to analyze how narratives about a domestic issue in Russia are
   used by malicious actors to promote harmful discourses globally and
   persuade an international audience on Twitter. We have identified bot
   and troll activities related to the Twitter discussions of a Russian
   opposition leader Alexei Navalny using social network analysis and bot
   detection. We have also implemented the BEND framework to find
   persuasion maneuvers that are used by bots in conversations about
   Navalny and found attempts to manipulate the opinion of the
   international audience on Twitter. Our findings have demonstrated that
   there is a significant presence of bot activities in information
   operations against Alexei Navalny as one of the leaders of the Russian
   opposition. We have observed how the Russian domestic issue is framed in
   the context of Russian confrontation with the West and how it is used to
   promote hostile narratives either against Navalny, an opposition
   movement, or democratic values. Many agents that we have identified
   pretend to be English speakers, who exhibit hostile attitudes towards
   Navalny and the Western democracies, express skepticism and distort the
   facts, promote a lack of trust in the democratic institutions as well as
   spread disinformation and conspiracy theories.},

Title = {How Do Nocebo Phenomena Provide a Theoretical Framework for the COVID-19
   Pandemic?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health issue, which leads to
   psychological and behavioural changes. In particular, among various
   negative feelings, fear seems to be one of the main emotional reactions
   that can be as contagious as the virus itself. The actual pandemic is
   likely to function as an important stressor, especially in terms of
   chronic anxiety and lack of control over the succession of unforeseeable
   environmental events. In this direction, the psychological impact of
   previous quarantine measures showed important negative psychological
   effects, including post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTTS) with
   long-lasting effects. The presence of psychological discomfort and
   disturbances due to negative contextual factors can be studied using the
   nocebo phenomenon as a possible theoretical explanatory framework.
   Although in the absence of studies linking nocebo to Covid-19 and
   data-driven evidence, the context of the actual pandemic may be seen as
   a fertile ground for amplified discomfort and anxiety. The media provide
   dramatic and negative descriptions and often present conflicting sources
   of information, which can lead to physical and mental health problems,
   diminishing response to treatment. This can be worse when supported by
   conspiracy theories or misinformation. The aim of this perspective
   review is to propose a new theoretical framework for the COVID-19
   pandemic, which should be supported by future empirical studies. In
   particular, the negative contextual factors, which can predispose
   individuals to psychological distress and the onset of the nocebo
   phenomena will be presented here, in order to suggest possible
   guidelines to mitigate the devastating effects of COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Population aging is and will be a reality that should be paid attention
   to, not only because of the progressive increase in their share, but
   also because of the growing numbers of people living in dependency and,
   by extension, human and technical qualification as it is required by the
   nurse who take care of them.
   Patients in Spain have gone from being passive recipients of health care
   to be a key part of the healthcare system, with health professionals
   being increasingly aware of this situation. The development of
   legislation on autonomy and rights of people contributed to that sick
   people are being better informed, and can participate in their health
   process.
   Nurses act on the basis of both the Spanish Legislation and the Code of
   Ethics of the Spanish Nursing, where key guidelines for ethical and
   legal performance of nurse are compiled. Nurses provide information on
   health status on a daily basis and as a consequence have to face major
   ethical dilemmas very often.
   As a general premise flight ends should be clear. Ends, such as the
   malfeasance produced the so-called information obstinacy (report a
   negative diagnosis or prognosis to a patient who does not want to know),
   as the conspiracy of silence in front of a patient who wants to be
   informed.
   Therefore, communication on the state of health of a person, in most
   cases, makes it easier so you can take appropriate measures to ensure
   the success of treatment and care or acceptance of their situation.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {339-354},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the ways in which media frames and
   rhetorical devices in the Chinese media shaped the representation of the
   genetically modified (GM) golden rice. We draw on a study of Chinese
   media representations of an experiment designed to test the efficacy of
   golden rice as a source of Vitamin A using school children in China's
   Hunan province as subjects. The study analysed Chinese web news stories
   about the Hunan experiment posted between 30 August 2012 (when
   Greenpeace first reported on the issue) and 30 October 2012. This
   experiment resulted in allegations of breaches in scientific protocols
   and created a hostile public reaction. The incident fuelled the
   long-standing debate about the risks and benefits of GM crops in China.
   In this article, we analyse 25 online news reports, examining the
   attitudinal orientation of the articles, the readers' comments on the
   articles and GM crops, the writing style and rhetorical devices
   employed, the emotions provoked and the frames manifest and embedded in
   these articles and comments. We found that although only one-third of
   the articles manifested an obviously negative attitude towards golden
   rice and GM foods, their use of strident metaphors and analogies were
   designed to arouse readers' fear and concerns about GM crops. In the
   anti-golden rice articles, we identified conspiracy frames, including
   the view that the West was using genetic engineering to establish global
   control over agriculture and that GM products were instruments for
   genocide. The pro-golden rice articles emphasised the scientific
   humanitarian progress, but it appears to be less attractive to the
   readers.},

Abstract = {Turmoil, social restlessness, lack of internal and local safety in
   post-constitution movement, the weakness of the Qajar, the unstable
   situation inside the country, the conspiracies of England, general need
   of the society to safety and stability, personal ambitions and several
   other factors led to the rise of Reza Khan in the political arena of
   Iran, there were scattered power centers and each one of them ruled
   independent from central government in its governing zones. Gholamreza
   Khan as the last governor of Poshtkouh was one of those local power
   centers. The goal of present paper is to describe the policies and
   strategies of Poshtkouh governor in confronting Reza Khan. Did Poshtkouh
   governor able to earn the trust of Reza Khan to remain in his title of
   being the governor of Poshtkouh? Gholamreza Khan, like his ancestors,
   had founded its ruling based on distrust. As he heard the news of
   proceeds of Reza Khan's troops to Poshtkouh, he retreated to his
   properties in Iraq and let his ancestral territory to fall in the hands
   of the central government. When the last governor of Poshtkouh failed in
   earning Reza Khan's trust, he changed his position and encouraged and
   motivated the tribes and leaders of clans to rebel against Reza Khan and
   ultimately, in 1929 a rebel emerges against Reza Khan in Poshtkouh.

Title = {The spread of COVID-19 vaccine information in Arabic on YouTube: A
   network exposure study},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {ObjectiveThe Arabic-speaking world had the lowest vaccine rates
   worldwide. The region's increasing reliance on social media as a source
   of COVID-19 information coupled with the increasing popularity of
   YouTube in the Middle East and North Africa region begs the question of
   what COVID-19 vaccine content is available in Arabic on YouTube. Given
   the platform's reputation for being a hotbed for vaccine-related
   misinformation in English, this study explored the COVID-19
   vaccine-related content an individual is likely to be exposed to on
   YouTube when using keyword-based search or redirected to YouTube from
   another platform from an anti-vaccine seed video in Arabic.MethodsOnly
   using the Arabic language, four networks of videos based on YouTube's
   recommendations were created in April 2021. Two search networks were
   created based on Arabic pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine keywords, and two
   seed networks were created from conspiracy theory and anti-vaccine
   expert seed videos. The network exposure model was used to examine the
   video contents and network structures.ResultsResults show that users had
   a low chance of being exposed to anti-vaccine content in Arabic compared
   to the results of a previous study of YouTube content in English. Of the
   four networks, only the anti-vaccine expert network had a significant
   likelihood of exposing the user to more anti-vaccine videos.
   Implications were discussed.ConclusionYouTube deserves credit for its
   efforts to clean up and limit anti-vaccine content exposure in Arabic on
   its platform, but continuous evaluations of the algorithm functionality
   are warranted.},

Title = {Public perception of electric vehicles on reddit over the past decade},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS IN TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding public perception of electric vehicles (EVs) is imperative
   for increasing EV adoption, which can significantly reduce greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions, thereby mitigating climate change and global
   warming. While most existing research characterizes public perception of
   EV in the context of surveys, questionnaires, or interviews, our study
   leverages Reddit online social network (OSN) data to capture EV public
   perception at a much larger scale. We have collected 3,437,917 Reddit
   posts (including 274,979 submissions and 3,162,938 comments) between
   January 2011 and December 2020 relevant to EVs and analyzed them along
   several axes to understand how EVs are perceived by the public on Reddit
   through the following research questions: (1) What EVrelated topics have
   been discussed by Reddit users? Whether/how Reddit users' interest in
   different topics has changed during 2011-2020? (2) What sentiment do
   Reddit users hold towards EVs? Whether public sentiment on Reddit has
   shifted over the past 10 years? (3) Whether/how do various Reddit
   communities (i.e., subreddits) have different perceptions of EVs? Our
   analysis evinces the potential of utilizing a large-scale OSN dataset
   for demonstrating a much wider spectrum of topics that the public is
   interested in than previous studies show, reveals fringe communities
   including r/conspiracy have many (controversial) discussions on EVs,
   especially on the environmental impacts of EVs, and one political
   community (r/The\_Donald) has similar patterns with fringe communities
   in both sentiment and topic aspects. By answering these research
   questions, we aim to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the
   public perception of EVs in the past decade.},

Abstract = {Many conspiracy theories and worst-case scenarios have been produced
   about the COVID-19 pandemic. With a reductionist approach, this new
   coronavirus disease outbreak has been regrettably confined to the simple
   matter that humans are exposed to viral pathogens of certain wild
   animals. However, the global reasons and outcomes of the present
   outbreak should not simply be correlated with the physiologies of a
   group of animals but with human activities subject to wanton
   consumption, interference with living spaces, intense commercialization
   and, particularly, dietary habits. Thus, reconceptualizing pandemics as
   a multidimensional ``ecological crisis{''} posing a threat to the future
   of human and nonhuman beings rather than a ``disease{''} endangering
   human welfare seems to become the sole prerequisite for a significant
   policy shift in the relationship between humans and animals. With this
   in mind, the eponymous protagonist of the novel, Elizabeth Costello, a
   vegetarian like her creator, gives the traces of an ecological
   philosophy which reinforces the notion that it is not the sheer
   scientific productivity driven by the rationalization but the
   reconsideration of animal-human interactions that can prevent
   post-pandemic era from recurring outbreaks. In the novel, through her
   understanding of environmental ethics, J. M. Coetzee's vegetarian and
   writer protagonist provides discussions that help rethinking literature
   as one of the guiding disciplines that can offer new insights into the
   natural habitat of animals. This study intends to handle how Coetzee's
   thoughts on vegetarianism and human-animal interactions can become an
   ethical model for the future world in dire need of a post-pandemic
   paradigm shift.},

Title = {Understanding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy:
   Evidence from the community-driven knowledge site Quora},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Abstract = {ObjectiveThe present study aims to examine the threshold of coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy over time and public discourse
   around COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy. MethodsWe collected 3,952
   questions and 66,820 answers regarding COVID-19 vaccination posted on
   the social question-and-answer website Quora between June 2020 and June
   2021 and employed Word2Vec and Sentiment Analysis to analyze the data.
   To examine changes in the perceptions and hesitancy about the COVID-19
   vaccine, we segmented the data into 25 bi-weekly sections. ResultsAs
   positive sentiment about vaccination increased, the number of new
   vaccinations in the United States also increased until it reached a
   ceiling point. The vaccine hesitancy phase was identified by the
   decrease in positive sentiment from its highest peak. Words that
   occurred only when the positive answer rate peaked (e.g., safe, plan,
   best, able, help) helped explain factors associated with positive
   perceptions toward vaccines, and the words that occurred only when the
   negative answer rate peaked (e.g., early, variant, scientists,
   mutations, effectiveness) suggested factors associated with vaccine
   hesitancy. We also identified a period of vaccine resistance, where
   people who decided not to be vaccinated were unlikely to be vaccinated
   without further enforcement or incentive. ConclusionsFindings suggest
   that vaccine hesitancy occurred because concerns about vaccine safety
   were high due to a perceived lack of scientific evidence and public
   trust in healthcare authorities has been seriously undermined.
   Considering that vaccine-related conspiracy theories and fake news
   prevailed in the absence of reliable information sources, restoring
   public trust in healthcare leaders will be critical for future
   vaccination efforts.},

Abstract = {From the time of his studies in Japan until his return to Korea in 1907,
   Yu Kilchun's acquaintances can be divided into three categories: people
   Yu met during his studies at Keio Gijuku, people Yu met to plan a coup
   during his exile, and people who participated in Tonga Ch'ongnyonhoe and
   Irhan Tongjihoe from 1906. Although his time at Keio Gijuku was not
   long, the people he met during his studies bonded strongly, and a
   network of academic contacts was formed through reunions. These
   connections played a crucial role when Yu was active in the political
   scene in 1894 during the Kabo Reform period. After Yu left Korea on an
   exile following Emperor Kojong's flight to the Russian legation in
   February 1896, he established a new network of acquaintances.
   Specifically, his journals from 1901 revealed that Yu was searching for
   people in Shizuoka, Gifu, and Hokkaido, who would take part in his
   conspiracy. Since he came to Tokyo after serving his time at the
   Ogasawara Islands, he worked with Tonga Ch'ongnyonhoe and Irhan
   Tongjihoe. Additionally, this paper demonstrated that he had connections
   with the Tonghak Order, and that it was possible for Yu to express his
   opinions in the press through O Sech'ang and Yi Inchik, who were
   residing in Korea. Around the same time, he also traveled around
   Yamanashi, Nagano, Toyama, and Fukui, and made efforts to facilitate
   trade between Korea and Japan. Such efforts were feasible thanks to the
   network of collaborators in Korea.},

Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {605-627},
Abstract = {ABSTACTIn the last two years, the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and
   Sham has transformed the Syrian Civil War, effecting serious
   confrontations in Iraq and Lebanon, dismantling security regimes along
   the Iraq-Syria border, and causing the mass exodus of ethno-religious
   communities across the region. These dramatic events are often
   interpreted through the official rhetoric of the group itself, which
   draws on discourses of the Sykes-Picot conspiracy and narratives of
   returning to Islamic principles. Tempting though it is to deconstruct
   such rhetoric on its own, efforts in this direction have over-emphasised
   its Islamic and territorial elements to the detriment of a deeper
   understanding of the locally varying, strategic nature of ISIS's
   activities in the Middle East. Accordingly, this paper considers how
   local interests articulate with ISIS's transnational movement, looking
   at their activities along the border region of Syria, Iraq, and Turkey.
   It begins with a discourse analysis of one important narrative in early
   analysis of ISIS's border-breaking rhetoric, the narrative of
   Sykes-Picot, before laying out how geographers have engaged with the
   geopolitics of radical Islamist militant groups more generally. Then
   drawing on a combination of secondary sources and ethnographic fieldwork
   in Turkey and Jordan, it elaborates how the politics of place shapes
   ISIS's political practice, using the example of the Syrian-Iraqi
   borderland (the Jazirah). In doing so, I hope to emphasise the relative
   importance of historical-geographic context over discourse and narrative
   for understanding the actions of ISIS.},

Abstract = {This article is about September 11, 2001, and its narrated effects on
   the lives of nine street-involved women in Vancouver's Downtown
   Eastside. I outline the locations from which they spoke about war and
   health: as consumers and economic agents whose bodies are linked to
   transnational economic processes; as residents in a local community of
   shared knowledge and practices; and as marginalized citizens of a
   nation-state. I hope to emphasize the value of engaging research
   subjects in coeval dialogues that work against essentializing,
   state-sanctioned discourses narrated in the context of armed conflict
   and a public health crisis. To women drug users in Vancouver's Downtown
   Eastside, the ``War against Terror'' evokes particular sites of
   knowledge: the body, the local community, and transnational processes.
   Their repertoires of war stimulate questions about citizenship and
   perceptions of risk, challenging dominating medical and political
   discourses that tend to temporally and spatially localize their
   engagement with the world.},

Journal = {HUMAN VACCINES \& IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 8},
Abstract = {As of August 2021, less than 5\% of the total population in Afghanistan
   has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Concerns remain regarding
   low uptake of the vaccine due to several factors. This study was
   conducted to understand the perception of the public on COVID-19 and its
   vaccines in Afghanistan. This was a formative study using qualitative
   method that included FGDs with vaccination target groups and KIIs, using
   interview guides in local languages in 12 provinces with 300
   participants during May-June 2021. Verbatim transcripts were created,
   and a deductive thematic analysis was conducted with transcripts after
   the key themes and sub-themes were developed and reviewed. Totally 24
   FGDs with male and female COVID-19 high-risk groups, 12 KIIs with EPI
   managers, and 12 KIIs with prison heads were conducted. Key themes
   included awareness and perception about COVID-19, its vaccination,
   motivators for getting vaccinated, barriers for not getting vaccinated,
   and sources of information. Awareness about the COVID-19 was high in
   urban areas compared to rural areas. Almost 60\% of the participants
   considered the COVID-19 vaccine effective. However, participants
   expressed their concerns regarding rumors and misconceptions on content,
   source, effectiveness, and side effects of the vaccine in their
   communities. Based on the study results, many participants expressed
   accurate knowledge about the COVID-19 disease and its vaccines.
   Significant barriers including misinformation, conspiracy theories, and
   fear of side effects persist. Collaboration between stakeholders and
   increasing awareness and engagement of communities about the benefits
   and effectiveness of the vaccines should be considered crucial.},

Title = {Public decisions about COVID-19 vaccines: A UK-based qualitative study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 6},
Abstract = {ObjectiveTo explore UK public decisions around whether or not to get
   COVID-19 vaccines, and the facilitators and barriers behind
   participants' decisions. DesignThis qualitative study consisted of six
   online focus groups conducted between 15(th) March and 22(nd) April
   2021. Data were analysed using a framework approach. SettingFocus groups
   took place via online videoconferencing (Zoom). ParticipantsParticipants
   (n = 29) were a diverse group (by ethnicity, age and gender) UK
   residents aged 18 years and older. ResultsWe used the World Health
   Organization's vaccine hesitancy continuum model to look for, and
   explore, three main types of decisions related to COVID-19 vaccines:
   vaccine acceptance, vaccine refusal and vaccine hesitancy (or vaccine
   delay). Two reasons for vaccine delay were identified: delay due to a
   perceived need for more information and delay until vaccine was
   ``required{''} in the future. Nine themes were identified: three main
   facilitators (Vaccination as a social norm; Vaccination as a necessity;
   Trust in science) and six main barriers (Preference for ``natural
   immunity{''}; Concerns over possible side effects; Perceived lack of
   information; Distrust in government;; Conspiracy theories; ``Covid echo
   chambers{''}) to vaccine uptake. ConclusionIn order to address vaccine
   uptake and vaccine hesitancy, it is useful to understand the reasons
   behind people's decisions to accept or refuse an offer of a vaccine, and
   to listen to them and engage with, rather than dismiss, these reasons.
   Those working in public health or health communication around vaccines,
   including COVID-19 vaccines, in and beyond the UK, might benefit from
   incorporating the facilitators and barriers found in this study.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of the pandemic, military conflicts and political maelstrom
   have changed the constellation of the information environment,
   generating a noticeable increase in ignorance, disinformation, and
   manipulation resulting in fake news, conspiracy theories and hate
   speech. The phenomena are escalated and intensified by rapid
   technological progress, widespread digitisation and its impact on all
   areas of life, especially political activity. Due to the changes brought
   about by the digital revolution, a new social formation has emerged,
   known as the information society, represented not only by politicians
   and social activists. The modified architecture of digital space causes
   the formation of new instruments, influence factors, and harmful social
   phenomena - previously present and recognised but never before so
   intense. This article describes and analyses the issue of ignorance,
   misinformation, disinformation and manipulation as potential and actual
   tools of political power and terrorism. The study assesses the impact of
   disinformation, manipulation and hate speech disseminated through social
   media sites and abused by politicians who use it to build and extend
   political power. It also examines the impact of these detrimental and
   injurious phenomena on the functioning of the rule of law, democracy and
   fundamental human rights. The article defines the terms ignorance,
   misinformation and manipulation, proving that a language, as a means of
   communication, should be neutral but is actually used for promoting
   ideology, coming to power, serving hatred and violence, and inciting
   criminal acts and crimes. Thus, worldwide political players use language
   and media to justify violence, spread false ideologies, and improve
   their public image.},

Title = {Recursive patterns in online echo chambers},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {Despite their entertainment oriented purpose, social media changed the
   way users access information, debate, and form their opinions. Recent
   studies, indeed, showed that users online tend to promote their favored
   narratives and thus to form polarized groups around a common system of
   beliefs. Confirmation bias helps to account for users' decisions about
   whether to spread content, thus creating informational cascades within
   identifiable communities. At the same time, aggregation of favored
   information within those communities reinforces selective exposure and
   group polarization. Along this path, through a thorough quantitative
   analysis we approach connectivity patterns of 1.2 M Facebook users
   engaged with two very conflicting narratives: scientific and conspiracy
   news. Analyzing such data, we quantitatively investigate the effect of
   two mechanisms (namely challenge avoidance and reinforcement seeking)
   behind confirmation bias, one of the major drivers of human behavior in
   social media. We find that challenge avoidance mechanism triggers the
   emergence of two distinct and polarized groups of users (i.e., echo
   chambers) who also tend to be surrounded by friends having similar
   systems of beliefs. Through a network based approach, we show how the
   reinforcement seeking mechanism limits the influence of neighbors and
   primarily drives the selection and diffusion of contents even among
   like-minded users, thus fostering the formation of highly polarized
   sub-clusters within the same echo chamber. Finally, we show that
   polarized users reinforce their preexisting beliefs by leveraging the
   activity of their like-minded neighbors, and this trend grows with the
   user engagement suggesting how peer influence acts as a support for
   reinforcement seeking.},

Abstract = {In the 1980s the concept of ``Etat moderne{''} gained more and more
   ground in the French historiography, and conventional statist concepts
   came in for severe criticism. The debate centred around not only general
   approaches concerning continuity of political processes from Antiquity
   to Modern times, but also around more specific issues, which,
   nevertheless, required serious reconsideration. With regard to this, the
   phenomenon of coup d'Etat and its interpretation in accordance with the
   development of Etat moderne is of exceptional interest. In the Early
   Modern time, there were no mechanisms of the dialogue between rulers and
   political communities. The absence of dialogue didn't mean the absence
   of conflict, therefore, the only remaining means of resolving such
   conflicts was political cataclysm (including a coup \&tat), and it was
   absolutely ordinary and imperative in the existing framework at the
   time. In order to outline the main features of coups d'Etat during the
   period of genesis of Etat moderne, it's necessary to systematize this
   phenomenon and to consider concrete examples of this classification. The
   most frequent form of coups d'etat, and historically the first one at
   the time, was usurpation, which was quite natural - as the power was
   physically represented in the body of the sovereign. The second form of
   coups d'Etat typical of the period of the genesis of Etat moderne were
   extraordinary actions in the course of dynastic crises. The third form
   of coups d'etat in the period of the genesis of Etat moderne were coups
   disguised as the struggle against conspiracy.},

Abstract = {At the turn of the 21st century, a new genre in German popular
   literature is in the process of developing into increasing complexity.
   It is the so-called `Dichter-und-Denker-Mantel-und-Degen' novel
   (something like a `swashbuckler' novel about `poets and thinkers'), a
   hybrid of historical novel, adventure novel and fictional biography of
   poets. The heroes of this new hybrid genre are famous German poets of
   the past. The plots are freely invented, obviously fictive, but
   nonetheless interwoven with well-known or at least verifiable historical
   and biographical facts. My first two examples of this new hybrid genre
   are two novels about the brothers Grimm, Die Geisterseher (1995) and Die
   Winterprinzessin (1997) by Kai Meyer. These texts combine the uncanny
   tone of the classic `Geheimbundroman', a typical German subgenre of
   gothic fiction about secret confederacies and conspiracies from the end
   of the 18th century, with the poetic of the marvelous, where wonder and
   enchantment are part of the fictive universe as in the fairy tales of
   the brothers Grimm. Next, I investigate Das Erlkonig-Manover (2007) and
   Das Hamlet-Komplott (2009) by Robert Lohr. Although these novels about
   Goethe's adventures also belong to the parahistorical,
   Dichter-und-Denker-Mantel-und-Degen' novels and are set at about the
   same time perios as Meyer's stories, the tone of these novels is
   completely different. Instead of the uncanny atmosphere evoked by
   pathetic language in Meyer's novels, Lohr's textworlds are constructed
   in an ironic tone, as they explore the metafictional potential of
   intertextual play, allusions and bricolage.},

Abstract = {Escape from Rome. The Spectacular End of the ``Kappler Case{''} in
   August 1977 During the night of the 14(th) to the 15(th) of August 1977,
   the German war criminal Herbert Kappler successfully escaped from a
   Roman military hospital to Soltau in Lower Saxony, Germany. At the time
   the sequence of events of this spectacular escape and its background
   were subject to diverse conspiracy theories and myths. According to
   these speculations Kappler was either released with the knowledge of the
   Italian authorities, liberated by either the Italian or German secret
   service, or was kidnapped by the German terrorist group Roter Morgen
   (Red Morning) in order to exchange him for Andreas Baader. The following
   article as precisely as possible delivers a reconstruction of the
   preconditions and the sequence of events surrounding Kappler's escape.
   This is followed by an analysis of the reactions to Kappler's escape by
   politicians, the public and the media in Germany as well as in Italy.
   Whereas the escape caused a political earthquake in Rome, Bonn remained
   silent for 11 clays. There was very little reaction in the West German
   media, whereas Kappler was even welcomed with flowers and congratulatory
   telegrams in Soltau. In Italy, however, the escape caused a storm of
   protest. Here media reports and public protests not only criticized the
   Italian government, but also the Federal Republic of Germany and its
   people. Just a few weeks later, the deutsche Herbst (German Autumn)
   began, preoccupying all parties concerned. Thus the escape of Herbert
   Kappler was soon mostly forgotten.},

Title = {Going Beyond Affective Polarization: How Emotions and Identities are
   Used in Anti-Vaccination TikTok Videos},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 10},
Abstract = {The rise of social media as a source of science and health information
   has brought challenges to informed citizenship and social trust due to
   the spread of misinformation, particularly anti-vaccination messages
   that incite hatred and discourage necessary health precautions. These
   messages often employ emotional appeals and identity cues. However,
   scholarship examining emotional appeals and identity cues in anti-vax
   messages is still at the nascent stage. Furthermore, most literature on
   emotions and identities on social media has focused on text-based
   platforms, despite the increasing popularity of interactive, multimodal
   platforms. To address these gaps, our paper analyzes recent TikTok
   anti-vax videos and incorporates the framework of multimodal frame
   processing, emotion-as-frames model, affective intelligence theory, and
   social identity theory. Our paper uncovers how different message
   modalities affect the impact of emotional narratives and identity cues
   on user engagement. We also investigate sociopolitical identity cues
   beyond partisan identities, expanding the current terrain of political
   communication. Our results demonstrate that audiences engage with
   emotional and identity cues in anti-vax videos differently based on
   distinct message modalities. We also found that identity cues related to
   interpersonal relationships (e.g. parental) and conspiracy groups were
   prevalent, in addition to partisan identity cues. These results offer
   new insights into sociopolitical identities beyond partisanship and
   highlight the importance of considering the multi-modal nature of video
   platforms. Overall, our paper sheds light on the complex relationship
   between emotions, identities, and message modalities on social media and
   provides important implications for addressing misinformation and
   improving science communication on digital platforms.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the use of Twitter as a presidential communication
   channel during the first few months of the COVID-19 crisis. The aim is
   to determine how four recently elected presidents (those of Spain,
   Argentina, Mexico and Brazil) managed their political communication, and
   to explore the thesis that they resorted to populist messages during the
   first months of their terms in office. Using a qualitative methodology
   and the XL Node tool to capture data, a comparative analysis was
   performed on the messages posted on their personal Twitter accounts
   during the first 20 weeks of 2020, classified in six categories:
   polarization: conspiracy; exaltation and leadership: personalisation and
   privacy: emotions and feelings: and media publicity. The results
   indicate that the four presidents share populist traits, but to a
   different extent. Lopez Obrador and Bolsonaro display a more populist
   profile, with emotional appeals to the people and to their saving action
   as regards the implementation of health policies. Conversely, Alberto
   Fernandez and Pedro Sanchez are more akin to the pop politician profile,
   posting photographs and media messages with a view to receiving press
   coverage. Both post tweets, based on values and historical events, aimed
   at their grassroots supporters. The main conclusion is that the pandemic
   has enhanced the presidential and personalist profiles of the four
   leaders, although their actions during the COVID-19 crisis were not
   necessarily in keeping with the populist paradigm. Thus, Sanchez and
   Bolsonaro implemented a health management communication stratey, while
   Lopez Obrador and Fernandez paid scant attention to health policy.},

Abstract = {I, A-- B--, do solemnly and voluntarily swear, that I will, to the
   utmost of my power, support and defend Her present Majesty, Queen
   Victoria, and her lawful heirs and successors... so long as she, he, or
   they, shall support and maintain the Protestant Religion... that I will
   to the utmost of my power, defend her against all traitorous
   conspiracies and attempts whatever, which shall be made against Her
   person, crown or dignity;... that I will steadily maintain the connexion
   between the Colonies of British North America and the Mother Country,
   and be ever ready to resist all attempts to weaken British influence, or
   dismember the British Empire.
   This article examines the Orange Order in the context of the British
   North Atlantic world during the early nineteenth century. It
   simultaneously conducts circum-, cis-, and trans-Atlantic analyses to
   argue that although Orangeism was a distinctly Atlantic institution,
   distinct local contexts - in this case Irish, metropolitan, and colonial
   - had a profound impact on the fate of the order in this period.
   Specifically, ``local peculiarities'' determined the authorities'
   attitude toward the Orange Order: the connection between Orangeism and
   politics led metropolitan authorities to discourage and ultimately ban
   the order, while the political activism of Orangemen actually served to
   strengthen the order's position in British North America. This
   examination concludes that the Atlantic remains a viable unit of
   historical analysis for the history of Orangeism in the first half of
   the nineteenth century but suggests that studying the brotherhood after
   the 1860s requires one to adopt the methodologies of world history.},

Abstract = {In the Spring of 2021, the COVID-19 vaccination was authorized for
   emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration. Healthcare workers
   (HCWs) are one of the most trusted sources of information for
   vaccination choices. However, HCWs at this time appeared to continue to
   have lower rates of COVID-19 vaccination uptake than expected in
   Arizona. The objective of this study was to examine factors that play a
   role in the vaccination decision-making process among Arizona HCWs.
   Between January and April 2021, 18 semi-structured interviews were
   conducted among physicians, emergency medical technicians and long-term
   care nurses in Pima County. The informed consent process was completed
   for each participant. The interview guide was informed by the Increasing
   Vaccination model to collect information on vaccination decision-making.
   A codebook was developed using an inductive approach. Coding and
   analysis was conducted using the software MAXQDA. Participants were
   primarily male (11/18, 61\%) and white (11/18, 61\%). Three participants
   identified as Hispanic. Initial themes that emerged included: mixed
   opinions concerning the innovations in COVID-19 vaccine development,
   access-related barriers, issues related to distribution inequities,
   concerns about misinformation and conspiracy theories, and dialogue
   concerning the benefits of requiring mandatory vaccination. The results
   gathered from this study indicate that there continues to be hesitancy
   among some healthcare professionals in Pima County. These results will
   be used to help Arizonan Health Departments promote rollout of novel
   vaccines more effectively through targeting relevant vaccination
   decision-making factors among HCWs.},

Title = {Transdiagnostic Mechanisms of Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic
   on Adults and Families in Germany: Study Protocol of a Cross-Sectional
   and 1-Year Longitudinal Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, psychological
   distress is increased. Transdiagnostic mechanisms, including trauma,
   personality functioning, mentalizing and emotion regulation are
   considered relevant to the development and maintenance of mental health
   problems and therefore may play a role in individuals' reactions to the
   pandemic. Aim: To identify moderating and mediating factors associated
   with pandemic-related distress and mental health problems in adults and
   families, we aim to investigate the interactions of interpersonal trauma
   (childhood trauma and domestic violence), psychological capacities
   (personality functioning, mentalizing and emotion regulation) and
   pandemic-related adversity on psychological distress during the COVID-19
   pandemic. Furthermore, we aim to investigate behavioral and cognitive
   consequences of the pandemic (e.g., media consumption, vaccination
   status, conspiracy beliefs). Methods: Using an online-based
   cross-sectional and longitudinal design, we will investigate a sample of
   adult participants recruited via online platforms in German-speaking
   countries over the course of 1 year with four measurements points via
   self-report instruments (personality functioning: PID5BF +; mentalizing:
   MentS, PRFQ; emotion regulation: DERS-SF; mental health problems: PHQ-9,
   GAD-7; a composite pandemic-related stress score). Structural equation
   and multi-level modeling will be performed for data analyses.
   Implications: This study will provide data on the moderating and
   mediating effects of trauma, personality functioning and mentalizing
   during the pandemic in a large community sample, particularly on
   vulnerable groups like families. Identifying transdiagnostic mechanisms
   of psychopathology in the course of a pandemic crisis may provide
   valuable insight for the development of pre- and intervention measures
   for potential psychological distress during and post the pandemic.},

Title = {Effects of fact-checking social media vaccine misinformation on
   attitudes toward vaccines},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {145},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Social media vaccine misinformation can negatively influence vaccine
   attitudes. It is urgent to develop communication approaches to reduce
   the misinformation?s impact. This study aimed to test the effects of
   fact checking labels for misinformation on attitudes toward vaccines. An
   online survey experiment with 1198 participants recruited from a U.S.
   national sample was conducted in 2018. Participants were randomly
   assigned to six conditions: misinformation control, or fact-checking
   label conditions attributed to algorithms, news media, health
   institutions, research universities, or fact-checking organizations. We
   analyzed differences in vaccine attitudes between the fact-checking
   label and control conditions. Further, we compared perceived expertise
   and trustworthiness of the five categories of fact-checking sources.
   Fact-checking labels attached to misinformation posts made vaccine
   attitudes more positive compared to the misinformation control condition
   (P = .003, Cohen?s d= 0.21). Conspiracy ideation moderated the effect of
   the labels on vaccine attitudes (P = .02). Universities and health
   institutions were rated significantly higher on source expertise than
   other sources. Mediation analyses showed labels attributed to
   universities and health institutions indirectly resulted in more
   positive attitudes than other sources through perceived expertise.
   Exposure to fact-checking labels on misinformation can generate more
   positive attitudes toward vaccines in comparison to exposure to
   misinformation. Incorporating labels from trusted universities and
   health institutions on social media platforms is a promising direction
   for addressing the vaccine misinformation problem. This points to the
   necessity for closer collaboration between public health and research
   institutions and social media companies to join efforts in addressing
   the current misinformation threat.},

Abstract = {Lung cancer was once a very rare disease, so rare that doctors took
   special notice when confronted with a case, thinking it a
   once-in-a-lifetime oddity. Mechanisation and mass marketing towards the
   end of the 19th century popularised the cigarette habit, however,
   causing a global lung cancer epidemic. Cigarettes were recognised as the
   cause of the epidemic in the 1940s and 1950s, with the confluence of
   studies from epidemiology, animal experiments, cellular pathology and
   chemical analytics. Cigarette manufacturers disputed this evidence, as
   part of an orchestrated conspiracy to salvage cigarette sales.
   Propagandising the public proved successful, judging from secret tobacco
   industry measurements of the impact of denialist propaganda. As late as
   1960 only one-third of all US doctors believed that the case against
   cigarettes had been established. The cigarette is the deadliest artefact
   in the history of human civilisation. Cigarettes cause about 1 lung
   cancer death per 3 or 4 million smoked, which explains why the scale of
   the epidemic is so large today. Cigarettes cause about 1.5 million
   deaths from lung cancer per year, a number that will rise to nearly 2
   million per year by the 2020s or 2030s, even if consumption rates
   decline in the interim. Part of the ease of cigarette manufacturing
   stems from the ubiquity of high-speed cigarette making machines, which
   crank out 20 000 cigarettes per min. Cigarette makers make about a penny
   in profit for every cigarette sold, which means that the value of a life
   to a cigarette maker is about US\$10 000.},

   North America's churches. This phenomenon showed how increasing
   engagement with the broader Atlantic world could carry ominous
   implications for colonial religious leaders, implications that would

   the early republic, finally crush any hopes of centered American
   religious authority. Eighteenth-century episodes of clerical. imposture
   help illuminate the increasing loss of cultural mastery faced by
   religious elites as a result of Atlantic anonymities, itinerant
   ministries, and democratic sensibilities. This article considers why so
   many in the eighteenth century attempted to pass as pastors, from
   British wanderers like the supposed brick-maker Samuel May to notorious
   criminals like Tom Bell or Stephen Burroughs. Understanding the
   conditions that led to these cases of clerical imposture leads to
   greater understanding of the nature of religious and cultural power in
   colonial North America and in the early American republic. The
   eighteenth century brought a crisis to America concerning the
   implications of cultural and demographic fluidity as elites worried more
   and more about assigning true value and uncovering conspiracy in a world
   newly dependent on appearances to establish authority. The increasing
   cosmopolitanism, immigration, and commerce helped make the colonial
   elites more wealthy and powerful, but they also now had to scramble to
   resist the potential for deception and imposture that the new
   engagements created. Such conditions made new room for con men, many of
   whom posed as pastors to access the power of religious authorities.},

Abstract = {Women's political representation and participation are the matter of
   human rights that women can entitled by the virtue of being human.
   However, the right to be voter and candidates are still problematic for
   women in developing countries. We cannot get much number of women in
   these regard as we compare them with their counter parts. In view of
   that, this study aims to address the determinant factors of women's
   participation in electoral politics as a voter and political candi-date.
   To undertake this study, mixed method of research was employed.
   Published journal arti-cles, books and reports of government were used
   as a secondary source, whereas questionnaires including open and close
   ended, interview (as supplementary technique) used as primary sources.
   In line with this, Chi square(x2) and binary logistic regression were
   used to determine the factors deterring women's participation in
   electoral politics as a voter and political candidate (campaigner).
   Accordingly, the study found out that gender role, political interest,
   patriarchy and politicization of ethnicity are significantly determines
   (affects) women's participation in voting at p < 0.05 significant level.
   On the other hand, family size, political instability, political
   interest, politicization of ethnicity, political conspiracy and media
   exposure are significantly determines (affects) women's electoral
   participation as apolitical candidate and campaigner at p < 0.05
   significant level. Henceforth, the government should establish enabling
   political environment which entertains genuine democratic political
   governance that empowers women to be active participant and beneficiary
   in the electoral politics of the country.},

Title = {The Relations between the University Professorship and the Bureaucracy

Abstract = {The article examines the relations between the professors of the
   Imperial Tomsk University and the bureaucracy in late Imperial Russia.
   These relations are interpreted ambiguously. On the one hand, the
   professorship of Imperial Universities is characterized as a
   trans-estate professional and corporate group with its own subculture,
   and on the other - as a corporation in many ways similar to the
   bureaucratic elite. It is emphasized that the modern bureaucracy of the
   late Imperial Russia really had qualities that brought it closer to the
   professorship. This is, first of all, a high level of education and
   awareness of their cultural mission to transform Russia based on the
   experience of European development. At the same time, the patronizing
   rhetoric and personalized control that the trustees and officials of the
   Ministry of National Education (MNE) used in their relations with the
   professorship indicate the patrimonial tradition. During the validity
   period of the University Charter of 1884 these elements have become a
   means for the restriction the academic autonomy. It is proved that
   professors mostly preferred non-conflict dealing with this restriction.
   Evasion of control and fencing of the space of direct self-expression,
   in particular in lecture halls, from fixation by sources having
   ``evidentiary force{''}, however, led to the fact that the trustee and
   officials of the MNE lose confidence in the professor to the professors.
   Under these circumstances the collective image of the professorship
   built up in the narratives of officials turned out to be loaded with
   often unverified conspiracy features of a force threatening the ``legal
   order of things{''} in the Russian Empire.},

Title = {Vaccine misinformation types and properties in Russian troll tweets},
Journal = {VACCINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6},
Pages = {953-960},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Objective: To identify the content of and engagement with vaccine
   misinformation from Russian trolls on Twitter.
   Methods: Troll tweets (N = 1959) obtained from Twitter in 2020 were
   coded for vaccine misinformation (alpha = 0.77-0.97). Descriptive,
   bivariate, and multivariable negative binomial regressions were applied
   to estimate robust incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95\% confidence
   intervals (95 \%CI) of vaccine misinformation associations with tweet
   characteristics and engagement (i.e., replies, likes, retweets).
   Results: Misinformation about personal dangers (43.0\%), civil liberty
   violations (20.2\%), and vaccine conspiracies (18.6\%) were common. More
   misinformation tweets used anti-vaccination language (97.3\% vs. 13.2\%)
   and referenced symptoms (37.4\% vs. 0.5\%) than non-misinformation
   tweets. Fewer misinformation tweets referenced credible sources (14.0\%
   vs. 19.5\%), were formatted as headlines (39.2\% vs. 77.0\%), and
   mentioned specific vaccines (11.3\% vs. 36.1\%, all p < 0.01) than
   non-misinformation tweets. Personal dangers misinformation had 83\%
   lower rate of retweets (95 \%CI 0.04-0.66). Civil liberties
   misinformation had significantly higher rate of replies (IRR: 7.65, 95
   \%CI 1.06-55.46), but lower overall engagement (IRR: 0.38, 95 \%CI
   0.16-0.88) than non-misinformation tweets.
   Conclusions: Strategies used to promote vaccine misinformation provide
   insight into the nature of vaccine misinformation online and public
   responses. Our findings suggest a need to explore influences on whether
   users reject or entertain online vaccine misinformation. (C) 2022

Abstract = {Global communities are currently confronted with a number of complex
   problems and threats, the reality of which is amplified by the media.
   These environmental and socio-political stressors have been accompanied
   by the spread of problematic psychological and behavioural tendencies,
   such as the growing polarisation of opinions and values, online
   radicalisation and extremism, deepening xenophobia and nationalism, the
   proliferation of irrational beliefs and conspiracy theories, and
   resistance to rational public policy measures. Here we argue that
   although they fall outside the scope of psychopathology, they
   nevertheless currently constitute a major challenge for psychiatry as a
   research domain and a clinical practise. To substantiate this claim, we
   outline the mechanisms by which media-transmitted stressors impact
   mental well-being and possibly psychopathology. The common denominator
   of these global problems and the media's construction of reality is the
   increase in uncertainty, unpredictability, and uncontrollability, which
   prompts defensive responding and, in predisposed individuals, functions
   as a potent source of chronic stress. These contribute to cognitive
   inflexibility, a strong predisposing factor for the development of rigid
   beliefs and attitudes, which to varying degrees underlie the adverse
   psychological and behavioural tendencies mentioned above. We suggest
   that the tightening of beliefs and ideas that is the result of cognitive
   rigidity may correspond to the clinical characteristics of induced
   delusional disorder. This can be seen as a (ultimately maladaptive)
   defensive strategy for coping with a high degree of uncertainty and
   unpredictability. We conclude by briefly outlining the possible ways in
   which psychiatry can face this challenge.},

Abstract = {Aim. The article presents identification and construction of the
   typology of attitudes of health care professionals in Ukraine to the
   current COVID-19 situation and vaccination process. Methods. Transcripts
   of 49 semi-structured interviews subjected to thematic analysis
   constituted the subject matter of the analysis. On the basis of the
   categories identified within the thematic analysis process, a typology
   was developed, with due account of two parameters: the idea about the
   origin of the virus: artificial or natural, and the attitude of the
   informants to the policy (implementation of policy decisions) chosen by
   the authorities to fight the virus. Combination of these two parameters
   gives four standpoints-types of attitude of health care professionals to
   the risks associated with COVID-19. Results and conclusion. Analysis of
   the results has enabled to outline the problem field for assessing the
   risk of COVID-19, which includes three topics, as well as to point 376
   Dynamics out four typical standpoints in the attitude displayed by
   health care professionals that are marked as ``magical thinking,{''}
   ``technological thinking,{''} ``negativistic thinking,{''} ``critical
   thinking.{''} Originality. The research was conducted during the third
   wave of coronavirus in Ukraine, therefore, it reflects the analysed
   opinions of health care professionals about the threat of COVID-19 and
   vaccination process. The fact that the research was performed using
   qualitative methods ensured focusing on subjective peculiarities of the
   perception of changes in the COVID-19 situation.},

Abstract = {No available vaccine against COVID-19 had yet been proven for

   group was parents with children aged 12-17 years. Parents' intention to
   vaccinate their children and factors associated with vaccinating their
   children, reasons for not intending to vaccinate their children, and
   circumstances whereby the parents would change their mind were recorded.
   Among the 1458 parents recruited, 65.6\% were planning to vaccinate
   their children. The main concerns were fear of the vaccine's
   side-effects (68.3\%) and conspiracy theories (18\%). The factors
   associated with parents' intention to vaccinate their children were
   mother's older age (40-49 years: aOR = 1.45, 95\% CI = 1.05-1.99; >= 50
   years: aOR = 2.09, 95\% CI = 1.16-3.75), high family income (aOR = 1.99,
   95\% CI = 1.41-2.79), and children with a history of chronic conditions
   (aOR = 2.02, 95\% CI = 1.25-3.25), while higher mother's education level
   was negatively associated (aOR = 0.41, 95\% CI = 0.27, 0.64). A
   comprehensive health education program regarding vaccinating children
   with COVID-19 vaccines is highly recommended for parents, particularly
   for young and highly educated mothers, to enhance children vaccination
   rate when the vaccine becomes available.},

Title = {The Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences-Positive scale
   (CAPE-P15) accurately classifies and differentiates psychotic experience
   levels in adolescents from the general population},

Abstract = {Background There is increasing interest in studying psychotic symptoms
   in non-clinical populations, with the Community Assessment of Psychic
   Experiences-Positive scale (CAPE-P15) being one of the self-screening
   questionnaires used most commonly for this purpose. Further research is
   needed to evaluate the ability of the scale to accurately identify and
   classify positive psychotic experiences (PE) in the general population.
   Aim To provide psychometric evidence about the accuracy of the CAPE-P15
   for detecting PE in a sample of Chilean adolescents from the general
   population and classifying them according to their PE severity levels.
   Method We administered the CAPE-P15 to a general sample of 1594 students
   aged 12 to 19. Based on Item Response Theory (IRT), we tested the
   accuracy of the instrument using two main parameters: difficulty and
   discrimination power of the 15 items.
   Results We found that the scale provides very accurate information about
   PE, particularly for high PE levels. The items with the highest
   capability to determine the presence of the latent trait were those
   assessing perceptual anomalies (auditory and visual hallucinations),
   bizarre experiences (a double has taken the place of others; being
   controlled by external forces), and persecutory ideation (conspiracy
   against me).
   Conclusions The CAPE-P15 is an accurate and suitable tool to screen PE
   and to accurately classify and differentiate PE levels in adolescents
   from the general population. Further research is needed to better
   understand how maladaptive psychological mechanisms influence
   relationships between PE and suicidal ideation (SI) in the general
   population.},

Abstract = {In the short period between 1837, when Queen Victoria came to the
   throne, and 1843, when the Theatre Regulation Act amended the Licensing
   Act of 1737 and thus reconfigured theatrical freedom and production in
   the United Kingdom, the fruitful collaboration of renowned novelist
   Edward Bulwer-Lytton and actor and theatrical manager William Charles
   Macready would prove to be decisive in shaping early Victorian drama and
   setting high standards in production and artistic integrity, which would
   be followed by successive managers. Both in the pursuit of the
   theatrical reforms that were advocated by Bulwer as a Whig member of
   parliament and in his new venture into dramatic writing, the author
   relied heavily on French models. The article analyses the French
   influence in Bulwer's first dramas that composed his cycle of French
   history plays, The Duchess de la Valliere (1837), The Lady of Lyons, or
   Love and Pride (1838) and Richelieu, or The Conspiracy (1839). Beyond
   using French sources and setting the action of these plays in France,
   the inspiration from French culture and history crucially imbued Bulwer
   with a sense of freedom to essay his peculiar and intuitive conflation
   of politics and romance. This freedom is especially the case in Bulwer's
   first works, for which after the revolutionary experience, a French
   context became the most suitable framework to articulate liberal ideas,
   to reflect the creation of a modern consciousness that was represented
   by the rise of the people and to connect these interests with the
   theatrical portrayal of manners, passion and sentiment.},

Pages = {237-257},
Abstract = {The Conservative government elected in 1979 was ideologically committed
   to deregulation and removed many of the state's previously established
   regulatory procedures. The policy permitted important changes in the
   structure of the meat rendering industry and in the processes employed
   by it. These changes were directly responsible for the spread of BSE
   through the British cattle herd and lead to a rising incidence of the
   human form of BSE - variant-CJD. The British Government - and
   particularly MAFF - sought to defend the meat industry by denying -
   until March 1996 - both the seriousness of the BSE epidemic in cattle
   and the possibility of a species jump from cattle to the human
   population. Ministers and officials insisted that beef was safe to eat
   and underpinned this stance by providing misleading or inaccurate
   information to Parliament and the public. This deception was made
   possible by officials having the power to manipulate the scientific
   evidence and to prevent research and the publication of research
   findings. The British Government also succeeded in obstructing European
   Union directives from 1990 and in intimidating the Commission. MAFF
   equated the ``public interest'' with that of the meat rendering industry
   and consistently put the financial interests of the dominant firms above
   public health. The conspiracy of silence and the deceits employed to
   hide the increased risks resulting from infectious agents carried by
   food and the public health implications of deregulation reflect not only
   the broad economic and industrial policy of the then government and its
   agencies, but also the state's lack of independence from industrial and
   financial interests.},

Abstract = {In his prescient book Achieving Our Country, Richard Rorty predicts the
   rise of a Trump-like strongman built on attacking, among other public
   figures, ``postmodern professors{''} (1998, p. 90). This speaks to the
   importance of anti-intellectualism to the populist movement in the US
   today. Always present in populist appeals, like McCarthy's placement of
   ``educated elites at the center of his communist conspiracy{''} (Peck,
   2019, p. 129), this approach ``seeks to undermine public discourse by
   attacking and devaluing education, expertise, and language{''} (Stanley,
   2020, p. 36). The result of these attacks is a return to tribalism and
   power, key facets of populist rhetoric and strategies. With the Covid-19
   pandemic dominating the US public discourse since 2020, the populist
   conservative movement has trained their anti-intellectual rhetoric
   towards a singular figure: Dr. Anthony Fauci. An anti-fandom community
   was thus born built around attacking and mocking Fauci, taking place
   within the larger populist movement. While this anti-Fauci rhetoric
   takes many forms, one of the most dominant is that of memes. Through an
   analysis of both formal (DeSantis merchandise and political cartoons)
   and informal (actual grassroots) anti-Fauci memes, I argue online
   communities have used anti-Fauci memes as a form of anti-fandom
   community building utilizing and bolstering anti-intellectual, populist
   rhetoric due to their ease of transmission, mutability, and
   personification of intellectualism on a singular figure. In this way,
   being ``anti-Fauci{''} allows the populist argument to seem like a
   personal grievance rather than a focused attack on academic thought
   itself.},

Abstract = {On 15 April 2002, Marwan Barghouti, a high profile Member of the
   Palestinian Parliament and a close aide of the late Palestinian leader,
   Yasir Arafat, was arrested and transferred to Israel for trial. On 14
   August 2002, he was charged with multiple counts of crimes including
   acts of terrorism, murder and conspiracy to murder. In the Courtroom in
   Tel-Aviv, Barghouti was being tried for acts of terrorism, but in the
   court of public opinion, Israel was using the trial to slander and
   discredit the Palestinian leadership as a bunch of murderous gangs,' and
   enemies of all mankind.' On his part, Barghouti uses the judicial space
   to go beyond the surface problem of law and legality to the deeper
   question of occupation - a problem that is at the depth but also all
   across the normative structure of Israel's legal order. Through
   re-signification, the accused becomes the accuser, putting the state of
   Israel and the occupation on trial. In this article, I consider the ways
   in which the accused and the accuser repurpose the legal material to
   produce and disseminate ideas, concepts, and images productive to their
   respective politics. Attending to the ways in which discourses of
   occupation, resistance, and terrorism were synchronized with the legal
   form, the article reflects on how the narratives move from the legal to
   the political, from the personal to the social, from the local to the
   global, and from the theological to the political, creating the
   conditions of possibility for meaning and understanding.},

Abstract = {The processes triggered from the sixteenth century, as a result of the
   European presence in the River Plate region, have generally been
   approached from the local vision and perspective of the conqueror all of
   which has often hampered understanding of the many aspects involved.
   With regard to the so- called Banda Oriental - the eastern part of what
   would be the River Plate Viceroyalty-we can see the decisive occurrence
   of particular factors that affects the native peoples in the area. As a
   consequence of their influence we can appreciate certain events and
   processes, specific in many cases which differ from those observed in
   the rest of the territories. One of them is the particular situation
   that exists in the borderland as a result of the continuous succession
   of armed or peaceful disputes between the Iberian kingdoms. In this way
   the indigenous society is forced to take part of the struggles and
   transformed direct or inderectly by the overcoming stakes. On one hand,
   slavery supported by Brazil in the XVI and the early XVIII centuries, a
   fact that involves the eastern part of the territory in a different way;
   on the other hand, the situation of the borderland imposed by the acting
   empires in the XVII and the XVIII leads to the configuration of an
   exclusion area with an heterogeneous population that could not result in
   a proper Indian one, being just a complex miscellany of miscegenation,
   trade, evasion and conspiracy, topics that have hardly been addressed so
   far by the local historiography.},

Title = {Too much pressure? Driving and restraining forces and pressures relating
   to the state of connected and autonomous vehicles in cities},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are predicted by many analysts
   to transform the transport system over the coming decades. Which
   direction and path this transformation will take remains highly
   uncertain, as do the related environmental effects. In the present study
   we examine the introduction of CAVs in cities in terms of the indirect
   or underlying processes (drivers) and the direct expressions of interest
   that are related to specific actions, events or processes (pressures).
   The drivers and pressures are identified in interviews with stakeholders
   from across the quadruple helix (academia, industry, government and
   civil society). We then use an analytical framework that combines the
   drivers and pressures of the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, States,
   Impacts, Responses) model and force field analysis. This framework is
   used to map survey data on the strength of the driving and restraining
   forces and pressures behind the introduction of CAVs in cities, and to
   identify which stakeholders are involved in this socio-technical
   transition. Results showed that there was a strong belief across
   stakeholder groups that CAVs should be connected with mobility planning
   strategies. This need for planning has been discussed at length in other
   contexts, and now our results show that respondents find this need is
   also present in the Swedish context. An unexpected finding was that
   those who are sceptical to CAVs may form unique groups with a broad
   range of stakeholder types, for example elderly people, cyclists, people
   who are concerned because of conspiracies related to new technology, and
   those who are concerned about environmental effects.},

Title = {Examining reactions to smoking and COVID-19 risk messages: An
   experimental study with people who smoke},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {102},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Smoking cigarettes worsens COVID-19 outcomes, and news media
   and health agencies have been communicating about that. However, few
   studies have examined how these messages affect attitudes, beliefs, and
   behavioral intentions of people who smoke. These are critical variables
   that can inform public health campaigns to motivate quitting smoking
   during the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: In August 2020, we conducted an
   online experiment in the U.S. with 1,004 adults who smoke. Participants
   were randomized to one of four message conditions: COVID-19 risk,
   smoking risk, combined risk of smoking for COVID-19 severity, or a
   non-risk control. Outcomes were message reactions (emotions and
   reactance), attitudes and beliefs (severity, susceptibility,
   self-efficacy, response efficacy for smoking and COVID19, and conspiracy
   beliefs), and behavioral intentions (smoking intentions,
   COVID-protective intentions, and information-seeking).Results:
   Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) showed that combined risk
   messages elicited higher perceived severity of smoking-related disease
   than control messages. Similarly, the combined risk condition resulted
   in greater intentions to quit smoking in the next month (vs. COVID-19
   risk condition) and intentions to reduce smoking in the next 6 months
   (vs. smoking risk and control; ps < .05). Multivariate logistic
   regression found that exposure to the combined risk messages (vs.
   control as referent) was associated with higher odds of mask-wearing
   intentions in the next 2 weeks (AOR = 1.97).Conclusions: Health agencies
   can possibly use messages that communicate about the combined risk of
   smoking and COVID-19 as a novel strategy to motivate people who smoke to
   quit and take protective action for COVID-19.},

Title = {Exploring public perceptions on alternative meat in China from social
   media data using transfer learning method},
Journal = {FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {98},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The emerging social media serves as a complementary source for consumer
   behavior analysis with spontaneous data it generates. However, most
   studies employ time-consuming content analysis or lexical sentiment
   analysis. Considering the richness of data and progress of data science,
   in this paper, we propose a transfer learning based method to explore
   public attitudes towards alternative meat (AM) using data from social
   media in China to provide an alternative perspective. We compare
   traditional machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Support Vector
   Machine with our BERT-based Alternative Meat (BAM) model on the
   annotated sample. BAM model outperforms others in terms of macro F1
   score and accuracy and is employed on the whole dataset later. The
   sentiment analysis result shows that among 41782 related posts we
   accumulated, about 42.10\% of posts are personal posts consisting of
   negative, neutral, and positive feelings towards AM with a proportion of
   28.77\%, 22.91\%, and 48.32\% respectively. It is less promising
   compared with the consensus previous studies reach that over half of the
   Chinese people are positive and few Chinese are negative towards AM. Our
   findings add to the blooming body of studies suggesting the relationship
   of people's willingness to try or purchase AM and factors including
   gender, geography, price, veganism, and food safety. Conspiracy theory
   is identified for the first time as the main reason for opposition to AM
   among Chinese consumers. Instead of the booster, traditional vegetarian
   substitutes especially tofu turn out to be an obstacle for accepting AM
   with much resemblances.},

Title = {Who is likely to vacillate in their COVID-19 vaccination decision?
   Free-riding intention and post-positive reluctance},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Despite the actual availability of COVID-19 vaccines to combat the
   pandemic, many people are still vacillating in their decision to
   vaccinate. In this study, we considered the effect of two relevant
   contextual issues on vaccination intention: the number of people
   infected with COVID-19 is increasing, and the pace of vaccination is
   gaining speed. Specifically, we hypothesized that having already
   contracted SARS-CoV-2 (post-positive reluctance) could lead people to
   underestimate the importance of vaccination. Moreover, as the number of
   vaccinated people increases, more hesitant people could fall into the
   free-riding intention category, benefitting from the immunity provided
   by others' vaccinations. Vaccine hesitancy becomes more critical as the
   vaccination campaign proceeds: at one point, it will be inevitable to
   deal with hesitant people. This study is part of a WHO Regional Office
   for Europe project and involved a representative sample of 5006 Italians
   interviewed in January-February 2021. In case of post-positive
   reluctance, both young age and female gender increase vaccine hesitancy,
   while a high level of education reduces free-riding intention.
   Considering post-positive reluctance and free riding, a protective
   effect on hesitancy is associated with negative affective states,
   adherence to protective behaviors, trust in health information sources,
   and resilience. In contrast, increased vaccine hesitancy is associated
   with a high level of conspiracy-mindedness and trust in media
   information sources. Recognizing and studying the post-positive
   reluctance and the phenomenon of free-riding people can help us to
   become more efficient in combatting the virus.},

Abstract = {The institutional political crisis is posited to be a great risk facing
   twenty-first-century societies. The instability of democracy, the
   increase in misinformation in electoral processes, and distrust by
   citizens are facts that are confirmed by studies such as The Economist
   Intelligence Unit (2018) or Freedom in the World (2018). In the context
   of the most recent US elections (3-Nov-2020), President Donald Trump
   initiated a dialog focused on an allegation of electoral fraud that
   mobilized the masses and culminated in an assault on the Capitol. In
   parallel, Twitter endorses the role of journalism (@ ABC, @AP, @CBSNews,
   @CNN, @FoxNews, @NBCNews, and @Reuters) as a gatekeeper to lies on the
   Internet. The aim of this study is to determined how the media treated
   the electoral process on their Twitter accounts, analyze the strategies
   they followed to combat Trump's fallacy, and verify the extent to which
   they contributed or not to the spread of the conspiracy theory. Using a
   general sample of tweets (n1 = 3,577), we applied a comparative content
   analysis methodology with a three-pronged approach
   (quantitative-qualitative-discursive) based on the use of keyword
   indicators (n2 = 34,430). The results confirm that the media offered
   verified content on the electoral process, using different sources and
   avoiding reproduction of Donald Trump's delegitimization speech. In
   general, they engaged in a fight against the theory of electoral fraud,
   against disinformation, and against the polarization of citizens, which
   are factors that have marked a scenario of doubt about the future of
   democracy.},

Abstract = {The hopes regarding the positive impact of the Internet and digital
   participation in civic society have faded in recent years. The digital
   realm is now increasingly discussed regarding its role in putting
   democracy in jeopardy and polarizing public debate by propagating
   extremist views and falsehoods. Likewise, the perception of so-called
   alternative media as beneficial carriers of counter-public spheres and
   as important complements to mainstream positions in social debate has
   flipped. Alternative media are now often associated with the ``Wicked
   web{''} of disinformation, political populism, or even radicalization.
   Following Quandt's (2018) notion of `dark participation' and Phillips
   and Milner's (2017) description of the Internet as ambivalent, this
   article asks, whether the same holds true for the users of alternative
   media: a segment of the audience traditionally discussed in terms of
   community, engagement, participation, and strong ideological
   identification with progressive political causes. Do users of `dark'
   alternative media bond with their media in similar ways to constitute
   communities of darkness? Based on interviews with 35 users of
   alternative media from a left-leaning, right-wing, Russian-tied and/or
   conspiracy spectrum users, uses of alternative media are pictured as
   grey rather than black or white. The findings illuminate the
   ambivalences within alternative media users as audiences and
   communities. Ambivalences are found regarding the use of alternative
   sources as audience or community members, regarding a shared attitude of
   criticality and anti-systemness, which connects trans-medially and
   trans-ideologically, as well as the experienced comfort of community,
   which can become a main motivation for use.},

Abstract = {Background: Adolescence can be a challenging time, characterized by
   self-consciousness, heightened regard for peer acceptance, and fear of
   rejection. Interpersonal concerns are amplified by unpredictable social
   interactions, both online and online. This developmental and social
   context is potentially conducive to the emergence of paranoia. However,
   research on paranoia during adolescence is scarce. Method: Our aim was
   to examine the prevalence, structure, and probabilistic causal
   mechanisms of adolescent paranoia. A representative school cohort of 891
   adolescents (11-15 y) completed measures of paranoia and a range of
   affective, cognitive, and social factors. A Bayesian approach with
   Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) was used to assess the causal
   interactions with paranoia. Results: Paranoid thoughts were very common,
   followed a continuous distribution, and were hierarchically structured.
   There was an overall paranoia factor, with sub-factors of social fears,
   physical threat fears, and conspiracy concerns. With all other variables
   controlled, DAG analysis identified paranoia had dependent relationships
   with negative affect, peer difficulties, bullying, and
   cognitive-affective responses to social media. The causal directions
   could not be fully determined, but it was more likely that negative
   affect contributed to paranoia and paranoia impacted peer relationships.
   Problematic social media use did not causally influence paranoia.
   Conclusions: There is a continuum of paranoia in adolescence and
   occasional suspicions are common at this age. Anxiety and depression are
   closely connected with paranoia and may causally contribute to its
   development. Paranoia may negatively impact adolescent peer
   relationships. The clinical significance of paranoia in adolescents
   accessing mental health services must now be established.},

Abstract = {This essay reads the South Korean sf thriller 2009: Lost Memories as an
   allegory about the history of Korean national sovereignty. Set in an
   alternate timeline in which this national history has been erased as a
   result of a Japanese conspiracy, the film's time-travel plot focuses on
   a group of Korean resistance fighters who struggle to restore the ``lost
   memory{''} of an authentic Korean national past. This alternate
   timeline-a timeline in which the national past is portrayed,
   paradoxically, as the product of an alternate present-achieves two
   related ideological functions. First, by erasing the problems posed to
   Korean national identity by the collaboration of a Korean elite during
   the colonial era, the film's allohistorical narrative perpetuates the
   myth of an effective anti colonial movement. Second, the alternate
   timeline provides a fictional mechanism to circumvent what Michel
   Foucault has described as the historical limit imposed by the atom bomb
   (and threat of mutually assured destruction) upon the institution of
   sovereignty and its ability to wage all-out war. Unable to assert its
   sovereignty in a war with Japan, Korea carries out its anti-colonial
   myth in the form of an allohistorical narrative. This nationalist
   appropriation of the genre of alternate history, however, fails to
   suppress what Marx describes in the Eighteenth Brumaire as the reduction
   of tragic action to farce, resulting from the repetition of historic
   events. In Lost Memories, the same time-travel narrative that allows the
   film to live out its anti-colonial fantasy has the unintended effect of
   reducing its nationalistic melodrama to an inauthentic historical
   parody.},

Abstract = {In the eighteenth century, chess was the game at which any man of wit
   would endeavour to be proficient. Among all chess players, Francois
   Andre Danican Philidor was the most prominent figure in France and
   England. His explanations of various combinations were not only meant
   for specialists, they were clear enough to be understood and reproduced
   by any player. In the spirit of the egalitarian ideas of the
   Enlightenment, the pawn, usually considered expendable, turned out to be
   essential to victory and could even bring down a king. Chess places
   kings and pawns on the same board. Common people, kings, aristocrats and
   clerics figuratively come together on the equalizing level of the game.
   The idea that the well-organized pawns could defeat any king perfectly
   fits the democratizing drift that pervaded the eighteenth-century French
   intellectual milieus. Considering the growing popularity of chess, it
   comes as no surprise that many philosophes took a liking to this form of
   mental exercise and spent both time and effort improving their skills.
   For Jean-Jacques Rousseau, however, chess turned out to be much more
   than a source of pleasure: Chess became not only a means to prove his
   intellectual capacities but also influenced his writing and discourse.
   This article aims to show how Rousseau structured hisDialogueswith a
   narrative grammar informed by the game of chess and adapted the formal
   structure of Philidor's treatise to stage the strategic demise of the
   conspiracy he blamed for disparaging his reputation and threatening the
   legacy of his work.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Whereas Romanian health officials have launched two national
   human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaigns, the uptake rate
   remained insignificant. Understanding local perceptions of the vaccine
   is necessary, as they could inform future educational programmes. Given
   that social media provide new opportunities to communicate about
   vaccination, this paper sought to explore the public's constructions of
   the HPV vaccine as they were expressed on Internet discussion forums.
   Methods: Twenty discussion forums, with a total sample size of 2,240
   comments (2007-2012), were included. We conducted a thematic analysis
   with a focus on language, informed by a discourse analytic approach.
   Results: Positive discourses relying on evidence-based arguments or
   cancer-related experiences battled with negative discourses that focused
   mostly on pseudo-scientific information and affect-based testimonials.
   Both camps made use of appeals to authority in order to provide powerful
   messages. Critics expressed high levels of mistrust in the health system
   and perceived the vaccine as dangerous, as part of a conspiracy, as
   unnecessary or as a promoter of promiscuity. By contrast, supporters
   considered the HPV vaccine to be helpful and criticized the
   irrationality of opponents. Ambivalence and uncertainty also emerged,
   along with criticism toward the suboptimal organization of the
   vaccination programmes. Findings highlight ways in which views about the
   vaccine are embedded in broader perspectives about science, the national
   medical system, society development and economic inequality.
   Conclusion: Online posts are likely to elicit fear and doubts around
   vaccination, which in turn may impair decisions. Findings indicate that
   targeted education campaigns are needed in order to address public
   concerns about vaccination.},

Abstract = {The Chicago Eight trial (September 1969-February 1970) concerns eight
   people accused of conspiracy after the summer 1969 riots that broke out
   during the Democratic National Convention in a context of increasing
   unrest due to the war led by the United States in Vietnam. Attorneys
   William Kustler and Leonard Weinglass had to fight on several fronts
   throughout the trial. Whilst having to assume their roles as law experts
   and making sure that legal proceedings should be respected in spite of
   several instances of power abuse by Judge Julius Hoffman, they stressed
   the political character of justice and of their clients' actions. They
   needed to deconstruct the criminal image and public enemy portrait
   brushed of their clients by the prosecution and media alike whilst at
   the same time attempting to requalify a criminal trial as apolitical
   trial. Several means were used to establish the political character of
   the trial. The attorneys notably anchored their clients' actions in a
   tradition of riot that stemmed from the very foundations of the United
   States. The way W Kustler conceived his role as ``lawyer of the antiwar
   movement{''} and his questioning of the judicial system were far from
   popular within legal circles however. Both attorneys also led a constant
   fight against the suspicious means used by the prosecution, which went
   against the most elementary laws of the judicial system (such as
   manipulating the jury for example). In several ways, the trial
   contributed to the evolution of the attorneys' practise of the law, the
   latter being liable to suffer from the judge's sanctions.},

Title = {Malaysia's crisis of political legitimacy: Understanding the 2020 power
   transition and `Sheraton Move' polemics through the `eyes' of Malaysian
   political science graduates},
Journal = {COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {This empirical study examines the reactions of 114 political science
   graduates in Malaysia, through a questionnaire-based survey on the power
   transition crisis that took place February 23rd to 1 March 2020.
   Throughout these ``seven long days{''}, there was little opportunity
   given to university students, who were concerned with the Malaysian
   political affairs, to share their views in light of the ``Sheraton
   Move{''} polemics and the formation of a new government (Perikatan
   Nasional, PN). Various responses from the students in the survey have
   been recorded among these are: the attitudes regarding the polemics of
   PN's ``backdoor government{''}; the conspiracy of the opposition's
   political parties to topple the Pakatan Harapan (PH) leadership; the
   prospect of Mahathir's unity government; the proposal for parliament
   dissolution and re-election; and the lessons behind the crisis. This
   study establishes that the 60.6 percent of the respondents rejected the
   power transition as it was during the political crisis, as well as
   supporting the criticisms on the formation of PN as betraying the
   people's mandate. Respondents (86.0 percent) also agreed that the
   Majesty King (Yang di-Pertuan Agong) had played an effective role during
   the turmoil and proposed re-election and dissolution of the parliament
   at the expense of justice for all. The lessons derivable from the
   ``Sheraton Move{''} is that the real politics approach is not relevant
   in the context of modern democracy, in Malaysia; there is the need to
   retain the spirit of consociational politics and the importance of
   political education for the youth in Malaysia, in particular, the future
   new voters.},

Abstract = {After the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) lost its
   parliamentary majority in the June 2015 national elections, President
   Recep Tayyip Erdogan sparked the re-emergence of nationalism and changed
   the course of Turkish politics. This was a vulgar, populist version of
   nationalism based on pillars such as a militaristic approach toward the
   Kurdish question, anti-Americanism, conspiracy theories, and a refusal
   to accept universal norms. With the help of this nationalism, Erdogan
   managed to stop the decline of the AKP and further consolidate his
   power. Russia has been the primary beneficiary of rising nationalism in
   Turkey. President Vladimir Putin has been able to manipulate the
   irrationality at the heart of Erdogan's populist nationalism. First, the
   withdrawal of Turkish-backed rebel groups has enabled the government of
   Bashar al-Assad to establish authority over Aleppo in Syria's north.
   Second, Turkey has accepted guardianship over Idlib, an isolation camp
   designed to ensure that jihadist groups do not pose a threat to the
   Assad regime. Third, Russia has expanded its sphere of influence to the
   west of the Euphrates by setting up bases in Manbij, Raqqa, Haseke, and
   Kobane. Fourth, Russia received \$2.5 billion in cash for its sale of
   S-400 air defense systems to Turkey. Finally, Turkey's shifting
   foreign-policy axis has jeopardized the harmony among NATO members. This
   picture shows that nationalism not only helps governments to rally
   people around the same flag; it is also an opportunity to maximize other
   states' foreign-policy goals.},

Title = {Mapping the Dutch vaccination debate on Twitter: Identifying
   communities, narratives, and interactions},
Journal = {VACCINE: X},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {1},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {In recent years, vaccination rates in the Netherlands have declined
   slightly, but steadily. The Dutch National Institute for Public Health
   and the Environment (RIVM) commissioned a Committee for Vaccine
   Willingness (VWC) to study the societal context of the decline. One of
   the societal contexts is the Internet, where audiences discuss
   vaccination and refer to sources of health-related information of
   varying quality.
   Working for the VWC, we have explored the Dutch vaccination debate on
   Twitter in order to: (1) identify online communities in the vaccination
   debate, (2) identify vaccine-related narratives; and (3) understand how
   the online communities interact with each other. We identified seven
   different communities, including (public) health professionals, writers
   and journalists, anti-establishment, and international vaccination
   advocates.
   The debate is spearheaded by the writers \& journalists community, while
   the health- and anti-establishment communities try to influence it. The
   health community circulates facts, figures and scientific studies, while
   negative messages about vaccination - either from a homeopathy or
   conspiracy perspective - are most prevalent in the anti-establishment.
   The facts and figures shared by the health community hardly reach other
   communities, whereas the myths introduced by the anti-establishment do
   spill over to other communities. Our study provides further evidence
   that negative perceptions about vaccination might be rooted in a wider
   sentiment of distrust of traditional institutions.
   We argue that Dutch health organizations should try to address
   questions, doubts, and worries among the general audience more actively,
   and present scientific information in a simpler and more attractive way.

Title = {Cancer Fear and Fatalism How African American Participants Construct the
   Role of Research Subject in Relation to Clinical Cancer Research},

Abstract = {Background: Lack of African American participation in cancer clinical
   trials has been identified as a critical problem. Historical
   interactions related to race, identity, and power may contribute to
   continued inequity in healthcare and research participation. Objective:
   The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of African
   Americans regarding cancer and research and how these perceptions shape
   their beliefs about participating as cancer research subjects. Methods:
   Three African American focus groups were conducted including people who
   had never participated in cancer research, those who had, and those who
   were asked but refused (n = 16). Discussion focused on their perceptions
   of cancer research and actual or potential participation as research
   subjects. Data were coded using both structured and inductive coding
   methods. Results: Fear and fatalism emerged in relation to research,
   race, power, and identity and were related to larger historical and
   social issues rather than only individual thoughts or feelings.
   Participants described fears of the unknown, death, mistrust,
   conspiracy, and discrimination together with positive/negative tensions
   between self, family, and community responsibilities. Conclusion:
   Complex identities linked perceptions of cancer and cancer research with
   broader historical and cultural issues. Fear, fatalism, and current and
   historical relationships influence how people perceive themselves as
   research subjects and may influence their decisions to participate in
   cancer research. Implication for Practice: Acknowledging how complex
   factors including race and racism contribute to health disparities may
   give nurses and other healthcare providers a better appreciation of how
   historical, social, and cultural dynamics at individual, community, and
   organizational levels influence access to and participation in cancer
   research.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has been a data-political spectacle. Data are
   omnipresent in prediction and surveillance, and even in resistance to
   governmental measures. How have citizens, whose lives were suddenly
   governed by pandemic data, understood and reacted to the pandemic as a
   data-political phenomenon? Based on a study carried out in Denmark, we
   show how society became divided into those viewing themselves as
   supporters of the governmental approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, and
   those who oppose it. These groups seem to subscribe to very different
   truths. We argue, however, that both sides share a positivist ideal and
   think that data and facts ought to rule. Both sides have also come to
   acknowledge that data are not unambiguous, and both cast increasing
   doubts on political uses of data. Though the people agreeing with, and
   the people opposing, the government strategy are in many ways
   surprisingly similar with respect to epistemic norms, they differ in
   what they perceive as dangerous or desirable, and in who they believe
   are telling the ``truth{''} about the pandemic. These different
   perceptions result in different types of pandemic-related activism.
   Resistance against restrictions is often understood as inspired by
   conspiracy theories and in some countries anti-restrictions activism has
   turned violent. In our case, however, we suggest that when looking at
   similarities and differences across both groups, the gap between those
   opposing and those agreeing with the government approach is not as
   unbridgeable as might be suggested by their beliefs in differing truths
   and the emerging societal division.},

Title = {Virality, only the tip of the iceberg: ways of spread and interaction

Abstract = {Misinformation has long been a weapon that helps the political, social,
   and economic interests of different sectors. This became more evident
   with the transmission of false information in the COVID-19 pandemic,
   compromising citizens' health by anti-vaccine recommendations, the
   denial of the coronavirus and false remedies. Online social networks are
   the breeding ground for falsehoods and conspiracy theories. Users can
   share viral misinformation or publish it on their own. This encourages a
   double analysis of this issue: the need to capture the deluge of false
   information as opposed to the real one and the study of users' patterns
   to interact with that infodemic. As a response to this, our work
   combines the use of artificial intelligence and journalism through
   fact-checked false claims to provide an in-depth study of the number of
   retweets, likes, replies, quotes and repeated texts in posts stating or
   contradicting misinformation in Twitter. The large sample of tweets was
   collected and automatically analysed through Natural Language Processing
   (NLP) techniques, not to give all the attention only to the posts with a
   big impact but to all the messages contributing to the expansion of
   false information or its rejection regardless of their virality. This
   analysis revealed that the diffusion of tweets surrounding
   coronavirus-related misinformation is not only a domain of viral tweets,
   but also from posts without interactions, which represent most of the
   sample, and that there are no big differences between misinformation and
   its contradiction in general, except for the use of replies.},

   Demography, Health Risk, and Social and Political Factors},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Background: Vaccination is considered to be a key public health
   intervention to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the success of the
   intervention is contingent on attitudes toward vaccination and the
   design of vaccination policies. Methods: We conduct cross-sectional
   analyses of policy-relevant attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination using
   survey data of a representative sample of Austrian residents collected
   by the Austrian Corona Panel Project (ACPP). As outcomes, we examine the
   individual readiness to get vaccinated, the support for compulsory
   vaccinations, and the preference for making the vaccine available free
   of charge. The independent variables include demographics, objective and
   perceived health risks, and social and political factors. Results:
   Although there is broad public support for making the vaccine available
   free of charge, vaccine hesitancy and the opposition to a vaccine
   mandate are widespread. The protective function of the vaccine for the
   individual only motivates limited support for vaccinations. Opposition
   to COVID-19 vaccination also stems from a lack of sense of community and
   an ongoing politicization of the issue through conspiracy theories and
   party politics. Conclusion: We propose that overcoming the inherent
   free-rider problem of achieving sufficiently high vaccination rates
   poses a potential dilemma for policymakers: Given the politicized nature
   of the issue, they may find themselves having to choose between making
   vaccinations compulsory at political costs and a lingering pandemic at
   high costs for public health and the economy. We propose that promoting
   a sense of community and addressing potential practical constraints will
   be key in designing an effective COVID-19 vaccination policy.},

Abstract = {The virus, currently the coronavirus, can be read psychoanalytically as
   a metaphor for strangeness, familiarity and uncanniness and reminds the
   subject of the limitations of what is physically controllable. The
   coronavirus and thus coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) challenges
   psychoanalysis to deal with the unconscious, repressed dynamics of the
   virus and, above all with the virus metaphor. The virus is a complex
   conceptual structure, the effects of which go far beyond the biological
   pathogen. Epidemic diseases have always been an image of social disorder
   and are also used as an explanation for their appearance: Oedipus and
   the plague over Thebes is a prominent historical example and refers to a
   transgenerational familial (sexual) disorder. The virus is understood as
   an invading element into one's own unknown cell, understood as the
   individual body and the collective body; it is the threatening stranger
   par excellence and at the same time synonymous with the highest
   flexibility. This specific penetration into one's own body evokes an
   archaic fear with the early defence mechanisms of the split between
   denial, introjection and projection but also immunity. When we speak of
   a virus today we always mean one thing above all: an invader that takes
   possession of an organism, a body, in order to enter into a symbiotic
   relationship with the host. An analogy to the occupation of the ego with
   super-ego or the id. We are currently witnessing how these effects of
   the coronavirus affect the subject psychologically: denial, division,
   paranoid conspiracy theories, voluntary schizoid isolation and the face
   mask debate.},

Title = {Communicating Health Information at the End of Life: The Caregivers'
   Perspectives},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {Health information and communication are key elements that allow
   patients and family members to make decisions about end-of-life care and
   guarantee a death with dignity. Objective: To understand caregivers'
   experiences regarding health information and communication during the
   illness and death of family members. Methods: This qualitative study was
   conducted in Andalusia based on the paradigm of hermeneutic
   phenomenology. Participants were caregivers who had accompanied a family
   member at the end of life for over 2 months and less than 2 years. Five
   nominal groups and five discussion groups were established, and 41
   in-depth interviews with 123 participants were conducted. Atlas.ti 7.0
   software was used to analyze the discourses. A comprehensive reading was
   carried out along with a second reading. The most relevant units of
   meaning were identified, and the categories were extracted. The
   categories were then grouped in dimensions and, finally, the contents of
   each dimension were interpreted and described given the appropriate
   clarifications. Results: Four dimensions of the dying process emerged:
   differences in caregivers' perceptions of information and communication,
   a conspiracy of silence, consequences of the absence or presence of
   information, and the need for a culture change. Conclusions: Poor
   management of health information and communication at the end of life
   increased the suffering and discomfort of patients and their families.
   The culture of denying and avoiding death is still present today. A
   change in education about death would better enable health professionals
   to care for patients at the end of life.},

Abstract = {To this day, Prince Max von Baden (1867-1929), the last imperial
   Chancellor, has been portrayed as a liberal politician of great
   integrity. However, his selective memoirs and speeches were to a great
   extent inspired and written by the moderate Kurt Hahn, his loyal Jewish
   advisor. The darker side of the Princes political views is revealed in
   his--so far unpublished--correspondence with the infamous racist writer
   Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Both men were great admirers of Richard
   Wagner and met in Bayreuth in 1909. Their friendship blossomed during
   the First World War, when the Prince encouraged Chamberlain to write
   anti-English propaganda pamphlets and acted as an intermediary between
   Chamberlain and William II. Both Baden and Chamberlain had betes noires
   in common: they believed the war to be the product of a Jewish
   conspiracy and feared a democratisation and westernization of Germany.
   Under Chamberlains influence, Baden celebrated the German government's
   1917 announcement of the U-boat war, although he had previously opposed
   the idea. Yet, while Chamberlains tuck to his reactionary agenda, the
   Prince started simultaneously to cajole the liberal circles around Paul
   Rohrbach. It was they who ultimately brought him to power. By November
   1918, Chamberlain was shocked that `his Prince' of all people handed
   over the government to the socialists. As a result, Max von Baden became
   an outcast in aristocratic and in right wing circles. Though he would
   advocate a military dictatorship for Germany in 1924, his former friend
   Chamberlain did not forgive him. He had found another `saviour' by
   then--Adolf Hitler.},

Abstract = {Socially and medically vulnerable groups (e.g., people 65 years or
   older, minoritized racial groups, non-telework essential workers, and
   people with comorbid conditions) experience barriers to COVID-19
   prevention and treatment, increased burden of disease, and increased
   risk of death from COVID-19. Researchers are paying increased attention
   to social determinants of health (SDH) in explaining inequities in
   COVID-19-related health outcomes and rates of vaccine uptake. The
   purpose of the present manuscript is to identify clinically significant
   predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake among people who were socially and
   medically vulnerable to SARs-CoV-2 infection. Analysis was informed by
   the SDH framework and included a sample of 641 baseline surveys from
   participants in a clinical trial designed to increase COVID-19 testing.
   All participants were at high risk of developing COVID-19-related
   complications or dying from COVID-19. Following community-based
   participatory research principles, a well-established community
   collaborative board conducted every aspect of the study. Multiple
   logistic regressions were conducted to examine the relationships between
   individual and structural factors and COVID-19 vaccine uptake. In the
   final time adjusted model, we found that vaccine uptake was only
   predicted by specific individual-level factors: being 65 years and
   older, living with HIV/AIDS, and having previously received a flu
   vaccine or a COVID-19 test. Those reporting to believe in
   COVID-19-conspiracy theories were less likely to get the COVID-19
   vaccine. More research is needed to identify predictors of vaccine
   uptake among people with comorbidities that make them more vulnerable to
   COVID-19 complications or death.},

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy during
   pregnancy.Design: We used regular expressions to identify publicly
   available social media posts from pregnant people expressing at least
   one reason for their decision not to accept COVID-19 vaccine.Setting:
   Two social media platforms - WhatToExpect and Twitter.Sample: A total of
   945 pregnant people in WhatToExpect (1017 posts) and 345 pregnant people
   in Twitter (435 tweets).Methods: Two annotators manually coded posts
   according to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE)
   working group's 3Cs vaccine hesitancy model (confidence, complacency and
   convenience barriers). Within each 3Cs we created subthemes that emerged
   from the data.Main Outcome Measures: Subthemes were derived according to
   the people's posting own words.Results: Safety concerns were most common
   and largely linked to the perceived speed at which the vaccine was
   created and the lack of data about its safety in pregnancy. This led to
   a preference to wait until after the baby was born or to take other
   precautions instead. Complacency surrounded a belief that they are young
   and healthy or already had COVID-19. Misinformation led to false safety
   and efficacy allegations, or even conspiracy theories, and fed into
   creating confidence and complacency barriers. Convenience barriers (such
   as availability) were uncommon.Conclusion: The information in this study
   can be used to highlight the questions, fears and hesitations pregnant
   people have about the COVID-19 vaccine. Highlighting these hesitations
   can help public health campaigns and improve communication between
   healthcare professionals and patients.},

Abstract = {With the recognition and influence of Twitter on modern society, an
   enormous amount of multimedia information is regularly generated and
   rapidly disseminated on the platform. These characteristics have caught
   the attention of automated accounts called bots that are frequently
   leveraged for malevolent activities. From distorting the political
   elections to crashing the stock markets to spreading conspiracy theories
   and fake news, various bot accounts have become a source of grave
   concern. Particularly, spambots have been known to mimic the behaviour
   of a legitimate user, making them almost insurmountable to detect. Of
   late, DNA inspired behaviour encoding of Twitter accounts such as
   B-Type,(3) and B-Content(3) DNA has achieved promising results in
   detecting the social spambots. However, the evolving nature of spambots
   drives academia and the industries to devise adaptive strategies to keep
   pace with the progressing capabilities of these spambots and curtail the
   menace caused by them. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid technique
   utilizing digital DNA as a base approach and augmenting it with the
   state-of-the-art BERT model pre-trained on the sentiment classification
   task. The proposed hybrid encoding is termed B-Sentiment(3) DNA.
   Further, the study extends B-Content(3) encoding and proposes
   B-Content(5) DNA encoding to make spambot detection more robust.
   B-Content(5) encoding achieved an accuracy of 75.23\%, surpassing
   B-Content(3) encoding, while the proposed hybrid approach,
   B-Sentiment(3) DNA, achieved an accuracy of 85.79\%, significantly
   outperforming all the DNA encoding techniques considered in this study.},

Abstract = {As countries continue to deal with the global COVID-19 pandemic and its
   consequences, policymakers recognize that science, technology, and
   innovation (STI) practices offer a means of addressing many of the
   health problems that arise from the ongoing pandemic. Such recognition
   has given rise to many STI policy initiatives across various areas of
   science and policy, leading to a better understanding of coronavirus and
   the development of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics.
   However, the practical implementation of vaccine and treatment
   strategies within local communities extends well beyond the laboratory.
   This study explored how misinformation and trust amplify or attenuate
   coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine perceptions of those from ethnic
   minority groups deemed more susceptible to the impacts of the virus.
   Primary data in this study were collected in Scotland through
   semistructured interviews with 26 expert and nonexpert members from
   Scotland's minority ethnic communities. The study findings show that
   risk perception is fluid and dependent on the information and evidential
   environment in which people find themselves. Misinformation, fake news,
   conspiracies, and trust or distrust (from prior experiences and historic
   practices) influence the perception of coronavirus and how risk messages
   are received, including the acceptance of coronavirus vaccines. This
   article reflects on Scotland's approach to building trust and COVID-19
   vaccine confidence and engagement based on the findings of this study,
   identifying areas of strength and areas for further improvement or
   research. The authors believe, as shown by our research, that vaccine
   engagement will be more impactful if developed by and with the public,
   and reflects public values, concerns, and priorities.},

Abstract = {This research is a comparative study of narrative strategies by Umberto
   Eco (1932-2016) and Jhumpa Lahiri (1967-) as the most extreme and
   diverse examples of the `narrative by proxy.' Eco, in his narrative and
   critical writings, insists on `memory,' on the act of remembering the
   past in order to build an identity and a future, while Lahiri with her
   novels in Italian puts emphasis on `oblivion' and forgetfulness as the
   key to liberation from the conflict of languages and cultures. In the
   novel The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, Eco builds an encyclopedic
   and paper memory of 20th-century Italy by means of memorabilia such as
   images, journals, novels, and comics. In the novel The Prague Cemetery,
   he uses not only a double narrator and the exchange between the model
   author and the narrator to render the narrator's identity ambiguous but
   also the false document on the Jewish conspiracy, which caused hatred
   against the Jews and changed the course of history. Lahiri, on the other
   hand, follows the style of Gertrude Stein, which is impersonal
   autobiography. In the novel In Other Words, she constructs a linguistic
   autobiography and in Whereabouts an impersonal one, by avoiding to name
   and identify the characters and places. Thus, this article is an attempt
   to demonstrate how the opposite concepts of `memory' and `oblivion,' in
   Eco's historical and the same time anti-historical strategies and
   Lahiri's transnational and anti-conventional ones, can contribute to the
   development of the narrative by proxy.},

Abstract = {Off-label drug promotion is commonplace in the United States, but it is
   not without its dangers. While the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not
   explicitly ban off-label promotion, the Food \& Drug Administration
   (FDA) in order to protect consumers from unsafe and ineffective drugs
   has taken steps to regulate it. The FDA does so through its intended-use
   regulation, which lists the types of evidence the FDA can consider in
   determining whether a drug is misbranded. It is a crime to sell a
   misbranded drug into interstate commerce or to conspire to do so. On
   September 25, 2015, the FDA proposed an amendment to the regulation,
   which has drawn opposition from various industry groups due to its
   potential to restrict the type of speech that is often used in off-label
   promotion.\& para;\& para;The First Amendment challenge to the proposed
   amendment rests on United States v. Caronia, in which the FDA was
   prevented from using truthful, nonmisleading speech to convict a
   pharmaceutical representative of a conspiracy to sell a misbranded drug.
   This Note examines whether the amendment to the regulation is
   permissible under Caronia. It first contends that the regulation does
   not facially violate the First Amendment. It further argues that the
   rule is constitutional and does not pose the same First Amendment issue
   as was seen in Caronia as long as the FDA implements it with care. This
   Note concludes by exploring various ways that the FDA can
   constitutionally regulate off-label drug promotion under the proposed
   rule.},

Title = {Mapping information exposure on social media to explain differences in
   HPV vaccine coverage in the United States},

Abstract = {Background: Together with access, acceptance of vaccines affects human
   papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine coverage, yet little is known about media's
   role. Our aim was to determine whether measures of information exposure
   derived from Twitter could be used to explain differences in coverage in
   the United States.
   Methods: We conducted an analysis of exposure to information about HPV
   vaccines on Twitter, derived from 273.8 million exposures to 258,418
   tweets posted between 1 October 2013 and 30 October 2015. Tweets were
   classified by topic using machine learning methods. Proportional
   exposure to each topic was used to construct multivariable models for
   predicting state-level HPV vaccine coverage, and compared to
   multivariable models constructed using socioeconomic factors: poverty,
   education, and insurance. Outcome measures included correlations between
   coverage and the individual topics and socioeconomic factors; and
   differences in the predictive performance of the multivariable models.
   Results: Topics corresponding to media controversies were most closely
   correlated with coverage (both positively and negatively); education and
   insurance were highest among socioeconomic indicators. Measures of
   information exposure explained 68\% of the variance in one dose 2015 HPV
   vaccine coverage in females (males: 63\%). In comparison, models based
   on socioeconomic factors explained 42\% of the variance in females
   (males: 40\%).
   Conclusions: Measures of information exposure derived from Twitter
   explained differences in coverage that were not explained by
   socioeconomic factors. Vaccine coverage was lower in states where safety
   concerns, misinformation, and conspiracies made up higher proportions of
   exposures, suggesting that negative representations of vaccines in the
   media may reflect or influence vaccine acceptance. (C) 2017 The

Title = {Problematizing official narratives of HIV and AIDS education in Scotland

Abstract = {When human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency
   syndrome (AIDS) are framed within an intersectional approach, they have
   the potential to transform understandings of social justice within the
   curriculum and education policy and practice in general. Yet, this
   transformative potential is often hampered by official narratives that
   fail to position HIV and AIDS as an integral component of overlapping
   systems of oppression, domination and discrimination. This article
   explores how official HIV and AIDS narratives tend to promote systemic
   injustice and inequality within education policy and practice in both
   Scotland and Zimbabwe, despite their good intents. We frame our argument
   within a transformative education discourse which seeks to create
   participatory and emancipatory HIV-related messages at school, tertiary
   and community levels. Using a narrative enquiry design, a Foucauldian
   theoretical lens was used to analyse the narratives derived from key
   informant responses, supplemented by analysis of key documents that deal
   with HIV and AIDS in both Scotland and Zimbabwe. Four broad narratives
   emerged: the `Gay' Narrative; the Migration Narrative; the Conspiracy
   Narrative; and the Religious Narrative. We discuss how each of these
   narratives entrench stigma across both developed and developing world
   contexts, and propose how a more intersectional interpretation would
   contribute to a deeper and less stigmatizing understanding of HIV, thus

Title = {Completely Anonymous Multi-Recipient Signcryption Scheme with Public
   Verification},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Most of the existing multi-recipient signcryption schemes do not take
   the anonymity of recipients into consideration because the list of the
   identities of all recipients must be included in the ciphertext as a
   necessary element for decryption. Although the signer's anonymity has
   been taken into account in several alternative schemes, these schemes
   often suffer from the cross-comparison attack and joint conspiracy
   attack. That is to say, there are few schemes that can achieve complete
   anonymity for both the signer and the recipient. However, in many
   practical applications, such as network conference, both the signer's
   and the recipient's anonymity should be considered carefully. Motivated
   by these concerns, we propose a novel multi-recipient signcryption
   scheme with complete anonymity. The new scheme can achieve both the
   signer's and the recipient's anonymity at the same time. Each recipient
   can easily judge whether the received ciphertext is from an authorized
   source, but cannot determine the real identity of the sender, and at the
   same time, each participant can easily check decryption permission, but
   cannot determine the identity of any other recipient. The scheme also
   provides a public verification method which enables anyone to publicly
   verify the validity of the ciphertext. Analyses show that the proposed
   scheme is more efficient in terms of computation complexity and
   ciphertext length and possesses more advantages than existing schemes,
   which makes it suitable for practical applications. The proposed scheme
   could be used for network conferences, paid-TV or DVD broadcasting
   applications to solve the secure communication problem without violating
   the privacy of each participant.},

Abstract = {Much past analysis of community participation, in programmes designed to
   produce either housing or infrastructure, is incomplete as a guide to
   governments and nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) in terms of the
   approach required to achieve success in this area. There are two main
   problems to consider when analysing this issue: one is whether community
   participation is practised at all, the other is how. This paper focuses
   on the former, aiming at providing some basis of understanding on the
   latter. Here, community participation is not seen as being just a means
   to enable the people to get, through mutual-help initiatives and
   possibly with outside help, the basic needs which, otherwise, would not
   be available to them, but also as a means to influence decisions in the
   political arena about issues that affect them.
   Existing models of community participation, such as Amstein's ladder of
   citizen participation, although adequate for analysis in developed
   countries, provide misleading results within a development context. A
   tentative classification for the evaluation of participation within
   underdeveloped countries is suggested, based on the degree of the
   external institutional involvement in terms of facilitating/carrying out
   community mutual-help projects. These levels of involvement are arranged
   in the form of a ladder composed of the following rungs: empowerment,
   partnership, conciliation, dissimulation, diplomacy, informing,
   conspiracy and self-management. Examples are used to illustrate these
   concepts. Cases of empowerment and self-management, at the opposite
   extremes of the ladder, demonstrate that basic needs can be achieved
   with or without governmental support. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Title = {Organization and evolution of the UK far-right network on Telegram},
Journal = {APPLIED NETWORK SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The instant messaging platform Telegram has become popular among the
   far-right movements in the US and UK in recent years. These groups use
   public Telegram channels and group chats to disseminate hate speech,
   disinformation, and conspiracy theories. Recent works revealed that the
   far-right Telegram network structure is decentralized and formed of
   several communities divided mostly along ideological and national lines.
   Here, we investigated the UK far-right network on Telegram and are
   interested in understanding the different roles of different channels
   and their influence relations. We apply a community detection method,
   based on the clustering of a flow of random walkers, that allows us to
   uncover the organization of the Telegram network in communities with
   different roles. We find three types of communities: (1) upstream
   communities contain mostly group chats that comment on content from
   channels in the rest of the network; (2) core communities contain
   broadcast channels tightly connected to each other and can be seen as
   forming echo chambers; (3) downstream communities contain popular
   channels that are highly referenced by other channels. We find that the
   network is composed of two main sub-networks: one containing mainly
   channels related to the English-speaking far-right movements and one
   with channels in Russian. We analyze the dynamics of the different
   communities and the most shared external links in the different types of
   communities over a period going from 2015 to 2020. We find that
   different types of communities have different dynamics and share links
   to different types of websites. We finish by discussing several
   directions for further work.},

Abstract = {A primary goal in recent research on contextuality has been to extend
   this concept to cases of inconsistent connectedness, where observables
   have different distributions in different contexts. This article
   proposes a solution within the framework of probabilistic causal models,
   which extend hidden-variables theories, and then demonstrates an
   equivalence to the contextuality-by-default (CbD) framework. CbD
   distinguishes contextuality from direct influences of context on
   observables, defining the latter purely in terms of probability
   distributions. Here, we take a causal view of direct influences,
   defining direct influence within any causal model as the probability of
   all latent states of the system in which a change of context changes the
   outcome of a measurement. Model-based contextuality (M-contextuality) is
   then defined as the necessity of stronger direct influences to model a
   full system than when considered individually. For consistently
   connected systems, M-contextuality agrees with standard contextuality.
   For general systems, it is proved that M-contextuality is equivalent to
   the property that any model of a system must contain `hidden
   influences', meaning direct influences that go in opposite directions
   for different latent states, or equivalently signalling between
   observers that carries no information. This criterion can be taken as
   formalizing the `no-conspiracy' principle that has been proposed in
   connection with CbD. M-contextuality is then proved to be equivalent to
   CbD-contextuality, thus providing a new interpretation of
   CbD-contextuality as the non-existence of a model for a system without
   hidden direct influences.
   This article is part of the theme issue `Contextuality and probability
   in quantum mechanics and beyond'.},

Title = {Savarkar (1883-1966), Sedition and Surveillance: the rule of law in a
   colonial situation},
Journal = {SOCIAL HISTORY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51+},
Abstract = {In March 1910, after two years of sustained surveillance by the colonial
   government, a young Indian revolutionary nationalist, Vinayak Damodar
   Savarkar (1883-1966), was arrested in London and extradited to India for
   trial. Among the charges he faced was the curious one of sedition. Using
   Savarkar as the starting point - and concluding with Gandhi's own
   encounter with sedition - this essay argues that sedition law had a
   critical, and extended, life in the colonial context, allowing the use
   of what were seen as dangerous words to be evidence of conspiracy long
   after the metropole had abandoned the practice. The colonial state's
   response to revolutionary nationalism gave rise to two principal
   colonial weapons against anti-colonial nationalism (whether manifested
   in Savarkar's call for armed rebellion or Gandhian nonviolent
   noncooperation). The first weapon was surveillance, a developing
   technology of state control that placed an increasingly large number of
   young `revolutionaries' under systematic monitoring. They were placed
   under surveillance to monitor not just what they were doing, but also
   what they were thinking, writing, and speaking. The second and perhaps
   more important weapon of the colonial state in India was sedition law.
   While sedition had a long history in Britain, the modern history of
   sedition was in fact inextricably linked to colonial rule. The history
   of colonial surveillance and the development of sedition law strongly
   suggests that the real danger posed by all nationalists, revolutionary
   and otherwise, lay in a violence that was far more rhetorical and
   symbolic than physical, for what was really at stake was the fundamental
   legitimacy of colonial rule.},

Abstract = {The invasion of Iraq was justified to the American people by a
   sophisticated propaganda campaign that reflected a think tank's vision
   for a new foreign policy. One objective of this article is to set forth
   a theoretical argument for analyzing modern propaganda campaigns as a
   feature of mass-mediated discourse crafted by think tanks and highly
   organized claims makers. We propose that the current structure of policy
   and critique is now institutionalized and formatted as War Programming,
   which connects criticism within a narrative sequence, including
   critiques and reflections about journalistic failings. The scope of the
   action is so immense that it precludes and preempts its critique. The
   second objective is to show how the rationale for the invasion was
   developed as a ``public conspiracy{''} over a decade by the members of
   the Project for a New American Century (PNAC). The third aim of this
   article is to describe and clarify why the PNAC plans for Iraq and an
   imperialist foreign policy received very little news media coverage.
   Qualitative content analysis of news materials suggests that the news
   sources and media shared a logic and perspective about ``timely and
   entertaining news.{''} The PNAC plan was not publicized by the major
   news media because it fell outside the focus of the Bush
   administration's propaganda campaign to demonize Iraq and its leader
   Saddam Hussein, who was held to be responsible for attacks on the United
   States. The implications of such a well-organized propaganda campaign
   for future news coverage of war are discussed.},

Abstract = {Gambling has been associated with an array of fallacious beliefs that
   foster risky gambling decisions. Research into other belief systems
   suggests that the endorsement of non-evidence based beliefs, such as the
   paranormal or conspiracy theories, can be reduced when people think more
   analytically. The purpose of this study was to explore whether an
   intervention designed to elicit analytical thinking was effective in
   altering the gambling beliefs and simulated gambling behaviour of 178
   regular electronic gaming machine (EGM) gamblers (102 males, 76 female).
   Participants were randomly allocated to complete either an analytic or a
   neutral priming task, followed by completion of belief measures
   (erroneous and protective) and play on a simulated EGM game. Results
   failed to show that priming for analytical thinking changed betting on
   an EGM; including features of bet size, bet change, persistence and
   theoretical losses. Contrary to expectations, results suggest that
   priming analytical thinking using generalised interventions does not
   appear to be effective in altering peoples' simulated gambling
   involvement or gambling beliefs. In fact, priming people to think more
   critically might be counterproductive by contributing to greater
   positive expectations about gambling outcomes. The results further
   suggested that the number of times a player alters their bet is a good
   indicator of theoretical gambling losses and is associated with
   irrational gambling cognitions. Interventions designed to promote safer
   thinking in gamblers should be implemented with care, as results from
   our study suggest that encouraging critical thinking in at-risk or
   problem gamblers may not be effective in reducing risky gambling.},

Abstract = {This piece examines the British reception of the biography of German
   Field Marshal Erwin Rommel by the British author Brigadier Desmond
   Young, upon which was based the Twentieth Century-Fox movie The Desert
   Fox (Hathaway, 1951), British newspaper reviewers showed a love-hate
   relationship towards the memory of the late Wehrmacht Field Marshal. For
   some, such as former opponent Claude Auchinleck and military historian
   Basil Liddell Hart, Rommel was a talented field commander and resistance
   martyr, tangled up in the 20 July 1944 conspiracy against Hitler, for
   which he had been forced to commit suicide; for others, Such as Hugh
   Trevor-Roper and Richard Crossman, he was an unthinking collaborator who
   had betrayed the Fuhrer only when the war had turned against the army.
   The author argues that the book and film set the precedent for the
   cultural rehabilitation of the Wehrmacht on screen, not only in
   English-speaking countries, but in West Germany too. Moreover,
   Anglo-American military histories and films tended to depoliticize and
   remilitarize the Wehrmacht even more than West German productions. Other
   films considered include The Battle of the River Plate (Powell and
   Pressburger, 1956), III Met by Moonlight (Powell and Pressburger, 1957)
   and Ice Cold in Alex (Thompson, 1958). The author argues that the
   postwar `clean hands' myth-making surrounding the Wehrmacht was
   performed not only by the West German film industry but by a
   transnational cultural division of labour which suited the needs of the
   Western alliance during Cold War rearmament and West German
   reintegration into the international community.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an authorization-based group-oriented secure
   broadcasting system based on the ID-based system proposed by Tsujii and
   Itoh. In the proposed system, any broadcasting secret in ciphertext form
   is addressed to ``group{''} instead of ``individual{''}. First of all,
   the broadcaster defines the message authorization strategy among the
   individuals in the destination group by considering the characteristics
   or restrictions of the secret, such as timeliness, integrity, or
   importance etc. Afterwards, the broadcaster broadcasts the secret in
   ciphertext form to the destination group such that the individuals in
   the destination group only can recover the secret by means of
   authentication, following a predefined message authorization strategy.
   In general, the broadcaster can define the message authorization
   strategy for a secure broadcast as one of the following: (1) restricted
   1-out-of-n, so that only the specified individual in the destination
   group can recover it; (2) unrestricted 1-out-of-n, so that any
   individual in the destination group can recover it; (3) n-out-of-n, so
   that all individuals in the destination group should collaborate
   together to recover it; (4) restricted t-out-of-n, so that only the
   specified t individuals in the destination group should collaborate
   together to recover it; and (5) unrestricted t-out-of-n, so that any t
   individuals in the destination group can collaborate together to recover
   it. The security of the proposed system is based on the difficulty of
   computing discrete logarithms over GF(p). Also, some possible conspiracy
   attacks on the proposed system are analyzed.},

Abstract = {Much of the existing literature on vaccine hesitancy and resistance
   focuses on the explicit reasons individuals justify their opposition to
   a particular vaccine or vaccination programs in general. We were
   therefore interested to assess vaccine hesitancy among university
   students in Palestine. A valid and reliable multi-item questionnaire was
   made available through social media to recruit Palestinian students. The
   survey was conducted between February and June 2021, and included
   socio-demographic information, knowledge and source of information about
   the disease, and attitudes towards COVID-19 conspiracy theories. The
   total number of respondents in this study was 840 students.
   Approximately 80\% of the respondents were females, 5.8\% of the
   respondents suffered from chronic diseases, and 38.9\% of the
   respondents either suffered from COVID-19 or had a family member who
   did. The respondents' intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was as
   follows: 65\% of males, 45\% of females, 53\% with chronic diseases,
   48\% without chronic diseases, and 51\% of patients previously suffered
   from COVID-19. General intention to get the influenza vaccine was 315
   (37.5\%) of those surveyed. The general assumption that COVID-19 is a
   man-made disease was agreed by 390 (46\%), with 66\% of these
   respondents intending to be vaccinated. The overall intent to receive
   the COVID-19 vaccine was highest among students who were relying on
   scientific sources for their information about the vaccine (63\%).
   Misinformation triggered by unregulated social media can have
   potentially serious repercussions on individuals and the community if it
   takes precedence over evidence -based guidelines.},

Title = {The ``<i>Invisible Other</i>{''}: Social Representations of COVID-19
   Pandemic in Media and Institutional Discourse},
Journal = {PAPERS ON SOCIAL REPRESENTATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This paper thematizes issues of ``otherness{''} in the representations
   of the COVID-19 pandemic in the media and institutional discourses. The
   emergence of unknown infectious disease represents a threatening event,
   intensively discussed in public and private communication. The pandemic
   crisis spread from China on a global scale and refocused the media
   agenda, transferring citizens' attention from immigration to health
   risk, superseding the racially connoted immigrant with an ``invisible
   other{''}. At first, Italian citizens were exposed to an institutional
   communication aimed at reassuring the population: ``no more than a
   flu{''}. Once the pandemic emerged as a public concern, alarm was used
   as a prevention strategy, legitimated by the recommendations of
   scientists: awareness stage. Successively, communication entered the
   divergence stage: multiple discourses emerged, both across scientists
   and politicians, and between lay people and experts, increasing
   uncertainty about the situation anchored into dilemma of health versus
   economic priority. Conjointly, representations of the disease offered in
   public discourses appealed to lay belief patterns: coronavirus was
   explained as result of either the unhygienic contiguity of the Chinese
   people to animals, or the interests of hidden powerful groups pursuing
   their goals (e.g., the conspiracy theories concerning 5G or lab-based
   viral weapon). Notwithstanding, the invisible infectious disease also
   increased awareness of human vulnerability on a global scale,
   engendering concurrent representations of otherness, which refer to
   humankind as the common ingroup. This process - contrary to the
   ``othering{''} occurring in the projection of the disease cause onto
   devalued outgroups - implies the assumption that the ``other may be
   me/us{''}.},

   Perceptions of Police},

Abstract = {Building on research demonstrating significant differences in how Black
   and White Americans view law enforcement, this study assesses how those
   differential views shape potential jurors' decision-making in the
   context of a federal drug conspiracy case in which the primary evidence
   against the defendant is provided by an FBI agent and an informant
   cooperating with the agent. A sample of 649 Black and White
   jury-eligible U.S. citizens were exposed to the case, in which a Black
   defendant is being tried, and where the informant-witness race (Black or
   White) was varied. Participants determined verdict, evaluated evidence,
   and completed additional measures. Results indicated that Black
   participants were significantly less likely to convict than White
   participants, especially in the White informant condition; rated the law
   enforcement witness as less credible, and viewed police more negatively
   across three composite measures. Exploratory analysis of how juror race
   and gender interacted indicates Black women largely drove racial
   differences in verdicts. Perceptions of police legitimacy mediated the
   relationship between juror race and verdict choice. We conclude that it
   is critical that citizens are not prevented from being seated on juries
   due to skepticism about police, given the risk of disproportionate
   exclusion of Black potential jurors. The legal processes relevant to
   juror excusals need to be reconsidered to ensure that views of police,
   rooted in actual experience or knowledge about the problems with fair
   and just policing, are not used to disproportionately exclude persons of
   color, or to seat juries overrepresented by people who blindly trust
   police.},

Abstract = {Competing schools of thought on the reconstruction of Proto-Austronesian
   stress contend that primary stress was either regular (falling on the
   penultimate syllable with possible phonetic conditions that triggered
   stress shift to the final syllable) or lexical (falling unpredictably
   either on the penult or ultima). In this study, I argue that the
   comparative evidence supports the first position: that primary stress
   fell regularly on the penultimate syllable and was not lexical. Further,
   primary stress was repelled to the final syllable if the penultimate
   syllable was open and contained a schwa nucleus. Three Austronesian
   first-order subgroups, Malayo-Polynesian, Western Formosan, and Paiwan,
   are shown to directly continue the reconstructed stress system of
   Proto-Austronesian, with stress falling regularly on the penultimate
   syllable but shifting to the final syllable after a schwa.
   I also argue that the inability of schwa to hold stress is a result not
   of quality, but rather of quantity, as it is shown that schwa was a
   zero-weight vowel in Proto-Austronesian. Words with a schwa in the
   penultimate syllable, C(sic)CVC, are shown to be sub-minimal, containing
   only a single mora. Daughter languages in Malayo-Polynesian underwent
   multiple cases of phonologically motivated drift, including consonant
   gemination, the deletion of penultimate schwa in three-syllable words,
   and vowel shift. These sound changes are argued to be part of a
   phonological conspiracy whose outcome is the addition of a mora to
   sub-minimal words. This study therefore offers both a reconstruction of
   Proto-Austronesian stress as well as a phonological explanation for
   these various sound changes in Malayo-Polynesian.},

Abstract = {This article traces the life of a single figure, Sufi Abdul Hamid, to
   bring into conversation the history of the transmission of Buddhism to
   the United States with the emergence of new Black religio-racial
   movements in the early twentieth century. It follows Hamid's activities
   in the 1930s to ask what Hamid's life reveals about the relationship
   between Buddhism and race in the United States. On the one hand, Hamid's
   own negotiation of his identity as a Black Orientalist illustrates the
   contentious process through which individuals negotiate their
   religio-racial identities in tension with hegemonic religio-racial
   frameworks. Hamid constructed a Black Orientalist identity that
   resignified Blackness while criticizing the racial injustice
   foundational to the American nation-state. His Black Orientalist
   identity at times resonated with global Orientalist discourses, even
   while being recalcitrant to the hegemonic religio-racial frameworks of
   white Orientalism. The subversive positioning of Hamid's Black
   Orientalist identity simultaneously lent itself to his racialization by
   others. This is illustrated through Hamid's posthumous implication in a
   conspiracy theory known as the ``Black Buddhism Plan.{''} This theory
   drew on imaginations of a Black Pacific community formulated by both
   Black Americans and by government authorities who created Japanese
   Buddhists and new Black religio-racial movements as subjects of
   surveillance. The capacious nature of Hamid's religio-racial identity,
   on the one hand constructed and performed by Hamid himself, and on the
   other created in the shadow of the dominant discourses of a white racial
   state, demonstrates that Buddhism in the United States is always
   constituted by race.},

   Scythian Myth about Kolaxais},

Pages = {229-260},
Abstract = {The article addresses the gold object found in 1988 in a grave-mound
   Perederieva Mogyla of the century BC. It relates to objects of unknown
   purpose, which are conventionally called cones. Two battle scenes are
   depicted on the Perederieva Mogyla cone. An analysis of the iconography
   suggests that the scenes consistently represent two key episodes of the
   legend (myth) about three brothers. The first scene shows the conspiracy
   of the elder brothers, the second scene - the death of the younger
   brother. The legend of the three brothers is well known in the Iranian
   mythological and epic traditions. It tells about the sons of the hero
   Fereydun (Thraetaona in the Avesta) - Salm, Tur and Iraj. Fereydun
   divided the world into three kingdoms and gave them to his sons. The
   younger son became king in Iran, and the elder brothers envied this.
   They conclude an alliance and kill Iraj. Analyzing and comparing the
   Scythian and Iranian myths, the author comes to the conclusion that the
   Scythian hero Kolaxais corresponds to the Iranian Fereydun/Thraetaona,
   and the story of his sons is depicted on the cone. The death of his
   younger son was the first death, the first blood with which the history
   of human wars began. It is a symbolic sacrifice that is made to seize
   power. The legend of the three brothers became the basis of the concept
   of power among the Iranian peoples, including the Scythians. She was
   associated with important royal and military rituals, in which they used
   the golden cone.},

Abstract = {Catchments that do not behave in the way the hydrologist expects, expose
   the frailties of hydrological science, particularly its unduly
   simplistic treatment of input and model uncertainty. A conceptual
   rainfall-runoff model represents a highly simplified hypothesis of the
   transformation of rainfall into runoff. Sub-grid variability and
   mis-specification of processes introduce an irreducible model error,
   about which little is currently known. In addition, hydrological
   observation systems are far from perfect, with the principal catchment
   forcing (rainfall) often subject to large sampling errors. When ignored
   or treated simplistically, these errors develop into monsters that
   destroy our ability to model certain catchments. In this paper, these
   monsters are tackled using Bayesian Total Error Analysis, a framework
   that accounts for user-specified sources of error and yields
   quantitative insights into how prior knowledge of these uncertainties
   affects our ability to infer models and use them for predictive
   purposes. A case study involving a catchment with an apparent water
   balance anomaly (a hydrological monstrosity!) illustrates these
   concepts. It is found that, in the absence of additional information,
   the rainfall-runoff record is insufficient to explain this anomaly - it
   could be due to a large export of groundwater, systematic overestimation
   of catchment rainfall of the order of 40\%, or a conspiracy of these
   factors. There is ``no free lunch{''} in hydrology. The rainfall-runoff
   record on its own is insufficient to decompose the different sources of
   uncertainty affecting calibration, testing and prediction, and
   hydrological monstrosities will persist until additional independent
   knowledge of uncertainties is obtained.},

Title = {Factors associated with the intention of Syrian adult population to

Abstract = {Background and objectives With global efforts to develop and deliver a
   COVID-19 vaccine rapidly, vaccine hesitancy stands as a barrier to these
   efforts. We aimed to estimate the proportion of Syrian adult population
   intending to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and, principally, to assess
   the demographic and attitudinal factors associated with it in order to
   approach suitable solutions. Methods An anonymous online questionnaire
   was conducted between 23rd December 2020 and 5th January 2021 in various
   provinces in Syria. A total of 3402 adults were sampled to reflect the
   population demographic factors. Attitudinal factors included Covid-19
   fears, risks, and beliefs on the origin. Vaccination hesitancy and
   knowledge were also measured. The intention to get vaccinated against
   COVID-19 was the primary endpoint. Results According to their
   statements, 1222 participants (35.92\%) will consent to get vaccinated
   against COVID-19. Our findings indicate that male gender, younger age,
   rural residence, not having children, smoking, fear about COVID-19,
   individual perceived severity, believing in the natural origin of the
   coronavirus, and high vaccination knowledge were positive predictors of
   embracing COVID-19 vaccine when it is available. Conclusion COVID-19
   vaccine acceptance rate is considerably poor across Syrian population
   compared to populations in developed countries. Vaccine hesitancy is
   closely bound to the fear of side effects and doubts about vaccine
   efficacy. Factors such as conspiracy beliefs and myths about the vaccine
   lower vaccine uptake. Thus, interventional educational campaigns are
   increasingly required to overcome misinformation and avert low
   vaccination acceptance rates.},

Abstract = {Despite being an effective cancer prevention strategy, human
   papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Canada remain suboptimal. This study
   is the first to concurrently evaluate HPV vaccine knowledge, attitudes,
   and the decision-making stage of Canadian parents for their school-aged
   daughters and sons. Data were collected through an online survey from a
   nationally representative sample of Canadian parents of 9-16 year old
   children from August to September 2016. Measures included
   socio-demographics, validated scales to assess HPV vaccine knowledge and
   attitudes (using the Health Belief Model), and parents' HPV vaccination
   adoption stage using the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM; six
   stages: unaware, unengaged, undecided, decided not, decided to, or
   vaccinated). 3779 parents' survey responses were analyzed (1826 parents
   of sons and 1953 parents of daughters). There was a significant
   association between child's gender and PAPM stage of decision-making,
   with parents of boys more likely to report being in earlier PAPM stages.
   In multinomial logistic regression analyses parents of daughters
   (compared to sons), parents of older children, and parents with a health
   care provider recommendation had decreased odds of being in any earlier
   PAPM stage as compared to the last PAPM stage (i.e. vaccinated). Parents
   who were in the `decided not to vaccinate' stage had significantly
   greater odds of reporting perceived vaccine harms, lack of confidence,
   risks, and vaccine conspiracy beliefs. Future research could use these
   findings to investigate theoretically informed interventions to
   specifically target subsets of the population with particular attention
   towards addressing knowledge gaps, perceived barriers, and concerns of
   parents.},

Abstract = {In the current research, we investigated the lay representations of the
   recent economic downturn, that had severe consequences on the lives of
   the involved people. We compared data of respondents from two countries
   that were affected to a different degree by the crisis: Greece (N = 529)
   and Italy (N = 327). We examined laypeople's representations of the
   perceived causes of the crunch (e.g., overconsumption, obscure power
   conspiracy), the strategies that are believed to be useful to overcome
   it (e.g., conforming to EU request, EU exit), and the political
   participatory activities (e.g., legal and illegal activism) that people
   intend to adopt. These variables were analyzed in light of two main
   predictors: political orientation and subjective economic vulnerability.
   The main hypothesis was that self-positioning on the left/ right axis
   may be a strong driver of lay representations and political
   participation. However, we expected that in conjunction with the linear
   effect of this variable, its quadratic effect should be considered as
   well. The latter specifies that in some circumstances the opinions of
   people self-positioned at the poles of the political spectrum may be
   closer to each other than to the opinions of the people that position
   themselves in the center which sometimes do not behave as moderate but
   appear more conformist. Additionally, we hypothesized that vulnerability
   may be a motive to seek for explanations of the crisis, to find
   strategies and to engage in activities to overcome it. Findings were
   generally in line with predictions and were discussed in the light of
   recent research and the context of analysis.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and administered at record pace in
   order to curtail the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccine hesitancy
   has impacted uptake unequally across different groups. This study
   explores the drivers for vaccine hesitancy in ethnic minority groups in
   the UK, the impact of social media on vaccine hesitancy and how vaccine
   hesitancy may be overcome. Twelve semi-structured interviews were
   conducted, coded and thematically analyzed with participants from ethnic
   minority groups in the UK who identified as vaccine hesitant. Social
   media played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy. For those who
   considered themselves healthy, seeing misinformation of extreme side
   effects relating to COVID-19 vaccinations on social media resulted in
   the opinion that the risk of vaccination is greater than risk from
   COVID-19 infection. For women, misinformation on social media regarding
   fertility was a reason for delaying or not getting vaccinated.
   Participants who had sources of information they trusted in outside of
   social media were more likely to choose to get vaccinated. This study
   identified the broad spectrum of views on vaccine hesitancy in ethnic
   minority groups in the UK. Enabling factors such as a desire to travel,
   and positive public health messaging can increase vaccine uptake,
   whereas a lack of trusted sources of information may cause vaccine
   hesitancy. Further research is required to combat misinformation and
   conspiracy theories. Effective methods include actively responding and
   disproving the misinformation. For an inclusive vaccination programme
   that reduces health inequality, policy makers should build trust amongst
   marginalized communities and address their concerns through tailored
   public health messaging.},

Title = {Rumor spreading: A trigger for proliferation or fading away},
Journal = {CHAOS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The dynamics of rumor spreading is investigated using a model with three
   kinds of agents who are, respectively, the Seeds, the Agnostics, and the
   Others. While Seeds are the ones who start spreading the rumor being
   adamantly convinced of its truth, Agnostics reject any kind of rumor and
   do not believe in conspiracy theories. In between, the Others constitute
   the main part of the community. While Seeds are always Believers and
   Agnostics are always Indifferents, Others can switch between being
   Believer and Indifferent depending on who they are discussing with. The
   underlying driving dynamics is implemented via local updates of randomly
   formed groups of agents. In each group, an Other turns into a Believer
   as soon asmor more Believers are present in the group. However, since
   some Believers may lose interest in the rumor as time passes by, we add
   a flipping fixed rate 0<d<1from Believers into Indifferents. Rigorous
   analysis of the associated dynamics reveals that switching from m=1 to m
   >= 2triggers a drastic qualitative change in the spreading process.
   Whenm=1, even a small group of Believers may manage to convince a large
   part of the community very quickly. In contrast, for m >= 2, even a
   substantial fraction of Believers does not prevent the rumor dying out
   after a few update rounds. Our results provide an explanation on why a
   given rumor spreads within a social group and not in another and also
   why some rumors will not spread in neither groups. Published under

Abstract = {This paper explores how citizen-users think and communicate about public
   opinion polling through an analysis of tweets published during and just
   after the 2010 UK General Election leaders' debate broadcast on Sky News
   on 22 April 2010, the second of three debates. For those who comment on
   events in real time through social media such as Twitter, a category we
   call the `viewertariat', this event was notable for Sky News's immediate
   coverage of a YouGov poll that seemed discrepant. Indeed, within an hour
   of the end of the debate, various mainstream media published a number of
   polls apparently at odds with each other. Such discrepancies opened a
   space for lay theories to emerge about relationships between political
   parties, media, polling firms, and the wider public itself. Individuals
   were pushed to find explanations and quick to publish them in a public
   assembly of views. Analysis of these data illuminates not just what
   people think, but how they think about long-term concerns of scholars
   and practitioners of politics and political communication, such as
   credibility, trust and power, and how citizens manage expectations
   during events where the outcome is uncertain. Accounting for
   viewertariat behaviour develops recent research on mediatized politics
   in important ways. First, we find some viewertariat members performing a
   lay tutelage role, providing information and explanations about polling
   and elections to fellow citizens who express confusion. This indicates
   the continued importance of informed public discussion to some citizens.
   Second, we find a blurring of elite/non-elite interactions alongside
   persistent theories about elite conspiracies.},

Title = {`William' and the old folks: Notes on infantilisation},
Journal = {AGEING AND SOCIETY},

Number = {4},

Abstract = {Critical concern with infantilisation practices - i.e. the tendency to
   treat older people as if they are dependent children - has for the most
   part concentrated on the negative associations between infantilisation
   and dependency in later life. Infantilisation is usually defined as an
   unwelcome imposition on older men and women who are often portrayed as
   relatively powerless to resist. Whilst the negative consequences of
   enforced infantilisation must not be ignored there are also occasions
   when infantilisation may be regarded as a voluntary or chosen mode of
   resistance on the part of older people to the decrements and external
   impositions of later life. The concept of infantilisation may therefore
   be enlarged to include modes of resistance involving processes of mutual
   identification of the old with the young; in certain instances even as a
   form of conspiracy between these two age groups against the wider
   society. This paper therefore pursues fictional images of such rapport
   as they occur in a selection of the `William'' stories written by
   Richmal Crompton during the period from 1919 up to her death in 1969,
   and with an appeal which continues up to the present day. The argument
   is that these stories of alliances between boyhood and `elders' may be
   regarded as vivid examples (a repository of positive images) of what may
   be described as `positive infantilisation': that is to say, of
   consciousness of the independence of subjective selfhood from the ageing
   body in the face of the misperceptions and misleading stereotypes of the
   (mature) adult world.},

Abstract = {The Central State Archive of the City of Moscow (TsGA of Moscow) holds
   documents that expand existing notions on the Soviet military
   construction of 1918-19, the formation of military intelligence and
   counterintelligence in Soviet Russia, and the ``third wave{''} of mass
   Red terror in 1919. These documents are mostly found in the seemingly
   insignificant fond of the Serpukhov uezd committee of the Russian
   Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Since in the autumn 1918 - summer 1919,
   the Field Staff of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic
   was located in Serpukhov and its military commissar, head of the
   registration department, and founder of the Soviet military
   intelligence, S. I. Aralov actively worked in the Serpukhov uezd
   committee, the committee protocols are of great importance for studying
   the formation of the Red Army and its special services. The documents on
   admission to the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and party
   registration of the Field Staff senior officials, brothers Alexei and
   Pavel Vasiliev contain new information on the personnel continuity in
   the Operational Department of the People's Commissariat for Military
   Affairs of the RSFSR and the Field Staff. Protocols of the reports of
   the old Bolshevik A. A. Antonov at the sessions of the Serpukhov uezd
   bodies of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) clarify the existing
   notions on the calamity of June 1919, which took place on the eve of the
   events associated with the arrest of the first Commander-in-Chief of all
   the armed forces of the Republic J. J. Vacietis and some of his
   employees in July 1919, the cleaning of the Field Staff initiated by the
   old Bolshevik, longtime associate of Lenin S. I. Gusev who replaced S.I.
   Aralov at his posts. There are also documents containing information on
   the Bolshevik leadership reaction to the events related to the explosion
   in the building of the Moscow Committee of the Russian Communist Party
   (Bolsheviks) on September 25, 1919, when 12 Bolsheviks were killed and
   55 received wounds of varying severity. These materials complement and
   correct data from the documents stored in the federal archives, in
   particular, in the Russian State Military Archive, which keeps documents
   on the history of the Red Army in 1918-41. For instance, it turns out
   that it was decided to arrest the bourgeoisie and other
   ``counter-revolutionaries{''} with their subsequent imprisonment in a
   concentration camp created specifically for this purpose in the
   Serpukhov district.},

Abstract = {The present article examines the role of political parties in
   transferring power from Qajar to Pahlavi. The main question of this
   article is that what was the role of political parties in transferring
   power from Qajar to Pahlavi? In response to this hypothesis political
   parties, especially in the fifth parliament, have played a major role in
   transferring power from Qajar to Pahlavi. The parliament played an
   unparalleled role in the reform process of Reza Khan. The parliament was
   the site of the day of the country, and were legal activities of the
   political and intellectual currents. The relations and interactions of
   these forces, in particular, formed political parties and political
   organizations that were first reflected in the parliament and eventually
   reflected outside it, directly or indirectly, on the fate of Reza Khan
   as the main actor in the political scene of Iran. Reza Khan also stepped
   up the steps in setting up relations with political factions and
   influencing their behavior and performance. Obviously, the parliament
   and political factions within it enjoyed a dominant and dominant role in
   this cycle. It can be said that the reign of Reza Khan did not come
   solely through violence, military force, assassinations and military
   conspiracies, but it was made through an open coalition with various
   groups inside and outside the fourth and fifth congresses. These forces
   were: The conservative reformist party, the reformist reformist party,
   the radical socialist party and the revolutionaries of the communist
   sect. The fifth parliament, which opened in 1303, was the second pillar
   of Reza Khan's reach. The type of research methodology will be
   descriptive-analytic.},

Abstract = {Purpose - To explore and document the emerging international market for
   stolen tractors and plant in the United Kingdom. Whilst this may appear
   to be a criminological problem relating specifically to rural crime, it
   is a sophisticated international criminal business organised by
   traditional organised crime groups (OCGs) such as the Italian, Polish
   and Turkish Mafia's in conjunction with a network of criminal
   entrepreneurs.
   Methodology/approach - Using annual statistical data provided by
   National Farmers Union (NFU) Mutual and Plant and Agricultural National
   Intelligence Unit (PANIU) and other material sourced using documentary
   research techniques supplemented by qualitative interviews with industry
   specialists we present 10 micro-case studies of rural OCGs engaged in
   this lucrative enterprise crime. The data is verified and authenticated
   using narrative inquiry techniques.
   Findings - There is an entrepreneurial dimension to the crime because
   traditional criminal families with knowledge of rural areas and rural
   social capital form alliances with OCGs. The practical utility of the
   NFU model of entrepreneurial alliances with interested parties including
   the police is highlighted.
   Research limitations/implications - Implications for research design,
   ethics and the conduct of such research which are identified and
   discussed. These include the need to develop an investigative framework
   to protect academic researchers similar to guidelines in place to
   protect investigative journalists.
   Practical implications - An investigative framework and the adaption of
   the business model canvass (Osterwalder \& Pigneur, 2010) to cover
   illegal business models are proposed.
   Social implications - Suggestions are provided for the need to legislate
   against international criminal conspiracies.
   Originality/value - Uses a mixture of entrepreneurship and
   criminological theories to help develop an understanding of the problem
   from an investigative perspective.},

Abstract = {The article considers the ``epistemology of everyday life{''}: since
   today the population objectifies the processes of its cognition and
   their results in social networks, the author applies the epistemological
   categories to the analysis of this material. The article is based on the
   materials of the report that was made at a conference organized by the
   University of Heidelberg and the Saint Petersburg State University on
   the topic: ``The human existence between the illness and the health as a
   philosophical and a cultural problem{''}. Its participants were engaged
   in clarifying the philosophical foundations of psychology and
   psychiatry. The article considers the emergence of such methodological
   seminars` tradition a hundred years ago at the University of Heidelberg
   when K. Jaspers and K. Wilmans discussed whether it is possible to use
   the concepts of ``norm{''} and ``deviation{''} to characterize the
   mental health of society. The author of the article proceeds from the
   fact that Anglo-Saxon empiricism based on video culture dominates in the
   modern world after the Second World War. The theoretical thought is not
   welcome; any theory is dismissed as ``a conspiracy theory{''}. This is
   the continuation of the epistemology of Bacon, who struggled with
   theories as of the ``ghosts of the theater.{''} However, there are two
   opposing currents within the empiricism. The first one is the intention
   to impose on the population a video sequence and ways of ordering the
   perceptions of this sequence into the familiar subjects - with the
   elimination of everything subjective. The second current is an
   expression of objection and self-affirmation, which is expressed in
   portraying oneself as the center of the world (a picture of
   ``selfie{''}).},

Abstract = {The article argues that collective labor law is a fundamental element of
   American exceptionalism and also a basic factor in the Swedish model.
   The two systems of labor law could hardly be more different: regulation
   of the unions in the early period of industrialism became minimal in
   Sweden and massive in America, where the courts were strongly antiunion.
   In both countries the way unions were treated by the public authorities
   had far-reaching effects not only on labor relations but also on
   political structure and on public policies. In Sweden, a near-absence of
   labor legislation and key decisions in the Supreme Court facilitated 0
   rapid growth of the unions and, indirectly, of the Social Democratic
   Labor Party, which became dominant in Swedish politics. In America,
   legal restraints were particularly effective against attempts to
   organize unskilled workers. Labor organizations became smaller, more
   middle-class oriented and less influential than they had a potential to
   become. Low levels of union membership effected workers' Participation
   in politics and elections and influenced America in a conservative
   direction. There is not much evidence that American workers, to begin
   with, were less inclined to organize than workers in Europe.},

Title = {Understanding Stakeholders' Perspectives to Increase COVID-19 Vaccine
   and Booster Uptake Among Black Individuals With Rheumatic Conditions},
Journal = {ARTHRITIS CARE \& RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 30},
Abstract = {Objective. Disparities in COVID-19 vaccine and booster uptake persist.
   This study aimed to obtain perspectives from community and physician
   stakeholders on COVID-19 vaccine and booster hesitancy and strategies to
   promote vaccine uptake among Black individuals with rheumatic and
   musculoskeletal conditions.Methods. We invited community leaders and
   physicians in greater Boston and Chicago to participate in
   semi-structured interviews using a moderator guide developed a priori.
   Participants were queried about how to best address vaccine hesitancy,
   strategies to target high-risk populations, and factors to identify
   future community leaders. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed
   verbatim, and analyzed thematically using Dedoose.Results. A total of 8
   physicians and 12 community leaders participated in this study between
   November 2021 and October 2022. Qualitative analyses revealed
   misinformation/mixed messaging and mistrust, with subthemes including
   conspiracy theories, concerns regarding vaccine development and
   function, racism and historical injustices, and general mistrust of
   health care systems as the top cited reasons for COVID-19 vaccine
   hesitancy. Participants also shared demographic-specific differences,
   such as race, ethnicity, age, and gender that influenced the identified
   themes, with emphasis on COVID-19 vaccine access and apathy. Strategies
   for community-based vaccine-related information dissemination included
   personal storytelling with an iterative and empathetic approach, while
   recognizing the importance of protecting community leader
   well-being.Conclusion. To increase vaccine uptake among Black
   individuals with rheumatic conditions, strategies should acknowledge and
   respond to racial/ethnic and socioeconomic injustices that engender
   vaccine hesitancy. Messaging should be compassionate, individually
   tailored, and recognize heterogeneity in experiences and opinions.
   Results from these analyses will inform a planned community-based
   intervention in Boston and Chicago.},

Title = {Global COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: A Systematic Review of Associated
   Social and Behavioral Factors},
Journal = {VACCINES},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {COVID-19 vaccines have met varying levels of acceptance and hesitancy in
   different parts of the world, which has implications for eliminating the
   COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this systematic review is to examine how
   and why the rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy differ
   across countries and continents. PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and
   Science Direct were searched between 1 January 2020 and 31 July 2021
   using keywords such as ``COVID-19 vaccine acceptance{''}. 81
   peer-reviewed publications were found to be eligible for review. The
   analysis shows that there are global variations in vaccine acceptance
   among different populations. The vaccine-acceptance rates were the
   highest amongst adults in Ecuador (97\%), Malaysia (94.3\%) and
   Indonesia (93.3\%) and the lowest amongst adults in Lebanon (21.0\%).
   The general healthcare workers (HCWs) in China (86.20\%) and nurses in
   Italy (91.50\%) had the highest acceptance rates, whereas HCWs in the
   Democratic Republic of Congo had the lowest acceptance (27.70\%). A
   nonparametric one-way ANOVA showed that the differences in
   vaccine-acceptance rates were statistically significant (H (49) =
   75.302, p = 0.009{*}) between the analyzed countries. However, the
   reasons behind vaccine hesitancy and acceptance were similar across the
   board. Low vaccine acceptance was associated with low levels of
   education and awareness, and inefficient government efforts and
   initiatives. Furthermore, poor influenza-vaccination history, as well as
   conspiracy theories relating to infertility and misinformation about the
   COVID-19 vaccine on social media also resulted in vaccine hesitancy.
   Strategies to address these concerns may increase global COVID-19
   vaccine acceptance and accelerate our efforts to eliminate this
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {Has the state's manipulation of the NHS dental contract systems
   deliberately, or accidentally, had corrupting effects on the behaviours
   of some members of the dental profession? If the answer is `possibly' or
   `probably', then obvious questions that follow include, `was this done
   deliberately' and if so, `why'? Could this have been done for largely
   altruistic reasons, or was it done to achieve government control for
   minimum cost? Might this have been undertaken for political, financial
   or ideological reasons - regardless of any adverse longer term
   consequences for some patients or for some dental professionals? Might
   it have been done to take greater control of the dental profession on
   the grounds that all professions are a conspiracy against the laity, as
   the mildly paranoid George Bernard Shaw once alleged? Is it possible
   that some of this manipulation might have been done to help to
   disempower yet another profession, allegedly to `modernise it', but
   perhaps to enslave it for its own reasons? Was this just another example
   of some statist politicians wanting to interfere in all aspects of UK
   society, regardless of their lack of specific understanding, or any
   proven expertise, in many areas? Could the state's manipulation of
   contracts and processes be regarded as an abuse of power by a virtual
   monopoly, which has been used to control a largely altruistic profession
   by imposing corrupting NHS dental contract systems with the most recent
   one involving `units of dental activity' (UDAs)? Perhaps it was really
   about some politicians wanting ever more power, control or money their
   usual drivers - with the dental and medical professions accidentally
   becoming casualties?},

Title = {One Law to Rule Them All: The Radial Acceleration Relation of Galaxies},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {836},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {We study the link between baryons and dark matter (DM) in 240 galaxies
   with spatially resolved kinematic data. Our sample spans 9 dex in
   stellar mass and includes all morphological types. We consider (1) 153
   late-type galaxies (LTGs; spirals and irregulars) with gas rotation
   curves from the SPARC database,. (2) 25 early-type galaxies (ETGs;
   ellipticals and lenticulars) with stellar and H I data from ATLAS(3D) or
   X-ray data from Chandra,. and (3) 62 dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) with
   individual-star spectroscopy. We find that LTGs, ETGs, and
   ``classical{''} dSphs follow the same radial acceleration relation: the
   observed acceleration (gobs) correlates with that expected from the
   distribution of baryons (g(bar)) over 4 dex. The relation coincides with
   the 1: 1 line (no DM) at high accelerations but systematically deviates
   from unity below a critical scale of similar to 10(-10) m s(-2). The
   observed scatter is remarkably small (less than or similar to 0.13 dex)
   and largely driven by observational uncertainties. The residuals do not
   correlate with any global or local galaxy property (e.g., baryonic mass,
   gas fraction, and radius). The radial acceleration relation is
   tantamount to a natural law: when the baryonic contribution is measured,
   the rotation curve follows, and vice versa. Including ultrafaint dSphs,
   the relation may extend by another 2 dex and possibly flatten at g(bar)
   less than or similar to 10(-12) m s(-2), but these data are
   significantly more uncertain. The radial acceleration relation subsumes
   and generalizes several well-known dynamical properties of galaxies,
   like the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations, the ``baryon-halo{''}
   conspiracies, and Renzo's rule.},

Abstract = {Tropical peatlands are known not only for their high, area-based, carbon
   emissions in response to land-use change but also as hot spots of debate
   about associated data uncertainties. Perspectives are still evolving on
   factors underlying the variability and uncertainty. Debate includes the
   ways of reducing emissions through rewetting, reforestation and
   agroforestry. A knowledge value-chain that is long and complex links (a)
   fundamental understanding of peat and peatland processes leading to
   sciencebased quantification and default values, (b) willingness and (c)
   ability to act towards emission reduction, and ultimately (d) to local,
   national and global actions that effectively provide rules, incentives
   and motivation to conserve peat and reduce emissions. We discuss this
   value chain, its stakeholders and issues that still remain partially
   unresolved. We conclude that, to shorten the denial and
   conspiracy-theory stages of debate that otherwise slow down steps B and
   C, networks of international and national scientists have to be involved
   at the early stage of identifying policysensitive environmental issues.
   Models span part of the knowledge value-chain but transition of analysis
   units requires specific attention, from soil volumes through area and
   commodity flows to opportunities for reductions. While drainage of
   peatlands triggers landscape-scale increases in emissions, factors
   beyond drainage depth, including nutrient supply, may have a major
   influence on decomposition rates. Attempts to disentangle the
   contributions of plant and peat-based respiration in surface flux
   measurements involve assumptions that cannot be easily verified in
   comparisons between land uses. With progress on A leading to new
   internationally accepted defaults and with resistance on step B reduced,
   the reality of C and lack of working solutions for D is currently
   constraining further progress.},

Title = {Turkish middle school students' evaluation of fallacious claims about
   vaccination},
Journal = {CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 18},
Abstract = {In today's world, there is too much information pollution and people
   circulate it without questioning, and the claims on controversial issues
   often contain fallacies and conspiracy theories. Considering this point
   of view, it is necessary to create citizens who critically evaluate
   information. In order to achieve this goal, science educators need to
   address students' evaluation of fallacies on controversial issues. The
   aim of the present study, thus, is to explore eighth graders' evaluation
   of fallacies about vaccination. We used case study in the study in which
   29 eighth grade students participated. We adapted a rubric that was
   developed by Lombardi et al. (Int J Sci Educ 38(8):1393-1414, 2016. ) to
   assess students' evaluation levels between claims and evidence and used
   it to analyze students' evaluations of each fallacy in groups and
   individually. The findings of this study indicate that students were
   mostly unable to evaluate claims and evidence critically. We advocate
   that attempts should be made so that students cope with misinformation
   and disinformation, ensuring that they establish a consistent
   relationship between claim and the evidence, and the social and cultural
   factors that affect their evaluation of false claims should be
   identified. The implications of this study suggest to make deliberate
   attempts in order to enable middle school students to evaluate claims
   and evidence critically in various science topics, particularly in
   health issues, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications of the present
   research include suggestion of a method including discussions of
   fallacies about controversial issues and utilizing additional data
   sources such as interviews to reveal student ideas in-depth and analyze
   students' decision-making skills.},

Abstract = {Popular perceptions about the recidivism of homicide offenders are
   contradictory, varying from one extreme - that such offenders rarely
   commit further violent offences - to the opposite, where it is thought
   that they remain at a high risk of serious reoffending. The present
   study draws on the records of 1088 persons arrested in Western Australia
   over the period 1984-2005 for domestic murders and other types of
   homicides (robbery and sexual murder), including attempted murder,
   conspiracy to murder, manslaughter (unintentional homicide) and driving
   causing death. Our database provides up to 22 years follow-up time (for
   those arrested in 1984) and accounts critically for the first and any
   subsequent arrests, if they occur. Of the 1088 persons, only 3 were
   subsequently arrested and charged with a homicide offence event in the
   follow-up period. Among those arrested for a murder and subsequently
   released, we estimate a probability of 0.66 (accounting for censoring)
   of being rearrested for another offence of any type. The corresponding
   probabilities for those originally arrested for manslaughter or for
   driving causing death were equal, at 0.43. A dynamic analysis of the
   longitudinal data by survival analysis techniques is used to reliably
   estimate these probabilities. Having a prior record increased the risk
   of re-arrest; for example male non-Aboriginals arrested for murder with
   at least one prior arrest have an estimated probability of 0.72 of being
   rearrested for another offence of any type. Their estimated probability
   of being rearrested for another serious offence was 0.33. These findings
   should be of interest to courts and correctional agencies in assessing
   risk at various stages of the administration of criminal justice.},

Title = {Neutrino mass hierarchy and electron neutrino oscillation parameters
   with one hundred thousand reactor events},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {Proposed medium-baseline reactor neutrino experiments offer
   unprecedented opportunities to probe, at the same time, the mass-mixing
   parameters which govern nu(e) oscillations both at long wavelength
   (delta m(2) and theta(12)) and at short wavelength (Delta m(2) and
   theta(13)), as well as their tiny interference effects related to the
   mass hierarchy (i.e., the relative sign of Delta m(2) and delta m(2)).
   In order to take full advantage of these opportunities, precision
   calculations and refined statistical analyses of event spectra are
   required. In such a context, we revisit several input ingredients,
   including nucleon recoil in inverse beta decay and its impact on energy
   reconstruction and resolution, hierarchy and matter effects in the
   oscillation probability, spread of reactor distances, irreducible
   backgrounds from geoneutrinos and from far reactors, and degeneracies
   between energy scale and spectrum shape uncertainties. We also introduce
   a continuous parameter alpha, which interpolates smoothly between normal
   hierarchy (alpha + 1) and inverted hierarchy (alpha = -1). The
   determination of the hierarchy is then transformed from a test of
   hypothesis to a parameter estimation, with a sensitivity given by the
   distance of the true case (either alpha + 1 or alpha = -1) from the
   ``undecidable{''} case (alpha = 0). Numerical experiments are performed
   for the specific setup envisaged for the JUNO project, assuming a
   realistic sample of O(10(5)) reactor events. We find a typical
   sensitivity of similar to 2 sigma to the hierarchy in JUNO, which,
   however, can be challenged by energy scale and spectrum shape
   systematics, whose possible conspiracy effects are investigated. The
   prospective accuracy reachable for the other mass-mixing parameters is
   also discussed.},

Title = {Disparities in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among a diverse
   community-based sample in Connecticut, United States},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE MEDICINE REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Though vaccination is among our strongest tools to prevent COVID-19
   infections, its delivery has proven chal-lenging. At a time when
   COVID-19 cases were rapidly increasing in the Northeast, we examined the
   role of sociodemographic factors, social determinants of health (SDOH),
   and health-related beliefs, including conspiracy theories, in
   influencing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among a diverse sample of
   Connecticut (United States) residents. Between August and December 2020,
   utilizing community partners and advertisements via social media, we
   surveyed communities known to be most impacted by COVID-19. We used
   descriptive analysis and multivariable logistic regression to examine
   vaccine hesitancy. Among 252 participants, most were female (69.8\%) and
   under the age of 55 (62.7\%). Approximately one-third reported household
   incomes less than \$30,000 per year and 23.5\% were non-Hispanic Black
   and 17.5\% were Hispanic/Latinx. While 38.9\% of par-ticipants were
   vaccine hesitant, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx participants
   were more vaccine hesitant (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] = 3.62; 95\% CI
   1.77, 7.40) compared to non-Hispanic Whites/Others. Additional factors
   associated with vaccine hesitancy after adjustment for socioeconomic
   status and barriers related to SDOH included low perceived risk of
   COVID-19 and not receiving COVID-19 information from medical
   institutions and community health workers (p < 0.05). Race/ethnicity,
   perceived risk, sources of health information, and con-spiracy beliefs
   played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy among this diverse
   sample. Interventions to promote vaccination should include trusted
   messengers and sources of information, while long term efforts should
   focus on addressing the social conditions that deter confidence in
   scientific data, vaccine efficacy, and the healthcare system.},

Abstract = {Credible evidence-based political discourse is a critical pillar of
   democracy and is at the core of guaranteeing free and fair elections.
   The study of online chatter is paramount, especially in the wake of
   important voting events like the recent November 3, 2020 U.S.
   Presidential election and the inauguration on January 21, 2021. Limited
   access to social media data is often the primary obstacle that limits
   our abilities to study and understand online political discourse. To
   mitigate this impediment and empower the Computational Social Science
   research community, we are publicly releasing a massive-scale,
   longitudinal dataset of U.S. politics- and election-related tweets. This
   multilingual dataset encompasses over 1.2 billion tweets and tracks all
   salient U.S. political trends, actors, and events from 2019 to the time
   of this writing. It predates and spans the entire period of the
   Republican and Democratic primaries, with real-time tracking of all
   presidential contenders on both sides of the aisle. The dataset also
   focuses on presidential and vice-presidential candidates, the
   presidential elections and the transition from the Trump administration
   to the Biden administration. Our dataset release is curated, documented,
   and will continue to track relevant events. We hope that the academic
   community, computational journalists, and research practitioners alike
   will all take advantage of our dataset to study relevant scientific and
   social issues, including problems like misinformation, information
   manipulation, conspiracies, and the distortion of online political
   discourse that has been prevalent in the context of recent election
   events in the United States. Our dataset is available at:

Title = {A Dynamic Trust Framework for Opportunistic Mobile Social Networks},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Opportunistic mobile social network (OMSN) enables users to form an
   instant social network for information sharing (e.g., people watching
   the same soccer game can share their instant comments). OMSN is ad hoc
   in nature, thus relies on the cooperation of members regarding message
   transmission. However, some uncooperative or malicious behavior from
   abnormal members may reduce network performance, even damage the entire
   network. Currently, there does not exist effective mechanisms to detect
   selfish and malicious nodes. To tackle this problem, we propose a
   dynamic trust framework to facilitate a node to derive a trust value of
   another node based on the behavior of the latter. The novelty of our
   framework includes the following: 1) we design a new metric for a trust
   value of a node and 2) we propose a ``two-hop feedback method{''} that
   requires intermediate nodes in a forwarding path to generate ACK
   messages to verify a node's honesty if they are two hops away. In most
   existing trust models, final ACK messages are considered as critical
   factors. In OMSN, nodes are not fully connected and final ACK messages
   cannot be reliably received. In order to avoid the problem that few
   final ACK messages can be received, we propose a ``two-hop feedback
   method.{''} Simulation results show that our approach is able to detect
   a majority of abnormal nodes including malicious nodes, selfish nodes,
   and those nodes launching conspiracy attacks. Thus, the entire network
   efficiency can be improved without negative impact of abnormal nodes.
   Besides, our trust framework can be easily applied to the current
   popular routing protocols of opportunistic networks.},

Abstract = {We use HST images to derive effective radii and effective surface
   brightnesses of 15 early-type (E+S0) lens galaxies identified by the
   SLACS Survey. Our measurements are combined with stellar velocity
   dispersions from the SDSS database to investigate for the first time the
   distribution of lens galaxies in the fundamental plane ( FP) space.
   Accounting for selection effects ( top priority to the largest Einstein
   radii and thus approximately to the largest velocity dispersions, sigma
   greater than or similar to 240 km s(-1)) and for passive evolution, the
   distribution of the lens galaxies inside the FP is indistinguishable
   from that of the parent sample of SDSS galaxies. We conclude that SLACS
   lenses are a fair sample of high velocity dispersion E+S0s. By comparing
   the central stellar velocity dispersion (sigma) with the velocity
   dispersion that best fits the lensing models (sigma(SIE)) we find <
   f(SIE)> equivalent to <sigma/sigma(SIE)> = 1.01 +/- 0.02 with 0.065 rms
   scatter. We infer that within the Einstein radii (typically R-e/2) the
   SLACS lenses are very well approximated by isothermal ellipsoids,
   requiring a fine tuning of the stellar and dark matter distribution (the
   bulge-halo ``conspiracy''). Interpreting the offset from the local FP in
   terms of evolution of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, we find d log
   (M/L-B)/dz = - 0.69 +/- 0.08 (rms 0.11) consistent with the rate found
   for field E+S0s and with most of the stars being old (z(f) > 2) and less
   than similar to 10\% of the stellar mass having formed below z = 1. We
   discuss our results in the context of formation mechanisms such as
   collisionless ({''}dry'') mergers.},

Abstract = {Digital Health Literacy (DHL) helps online users with navigating the
   infodemic and co-existing conspiracy beliefs to avoid mental distress
   and maintain well-being. We aimed to investigate the association between
   DHL and future anxiety (FA); and examine the potential mediation roles
   of information satisfaction and fear of COVID-19 (F-CoV). A web-based
   cross-sectional survey was carried out among 1631 Taiwanese university
   students aged 18 years and above from June 2021 to March 2022. Data
   collected were socio-demographic characteristics (sex, age, social
   status, university location), information satisfaction, F-CoV, DHL and
   FA (using Future Dark scale). The linear regression model was used to
   explore factors associated with FA. The pathway analysis was further
   used to evaluate the direct and indirect relationship between DHL and
   FA. A higher score of DHL (B = -0.21; 95\% CI, -0.37, -0.06; p = 0.006),
   and information satisfaction (B = -0.16; 95\% CI, -0.24, -0.08; p <
   0.001) were associated with a lower FA score, whereas a higher F-CoV
   score was associated with a higher FA score (B = 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.36,
   0.50; p < 0.001). DHL showed the direct impact (B = -0.1; 95\% CI,
   -0.17, -0.04; p = 0.002) and indirect impact on FA as mediated by
   information satisfaction (B = -0.04; 95\% CI, -0.06, -0.01; p = 0.002)
   and F-CoV (B = -0.06, 95\% CI, -0.08, -0.04; p < 0.001). Strategic
   approaches to promote DHL, information satisfaction, lower F-CoV are
   suggested to reduce FA among students.},

Title = {Exploring the Scope and Dimensions of Vaccine Hesitancy and Resistance
   to Enhance COVID-19 Vaccination in Black Communities},

Abstract = {Background The long history of distrust that characterizes the
   relationship between the Black/African-American population and the US
   Medical community makes COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy of great concern. A
   needs assessment of the Black/African-American community assessed
   willingness and explored the perceptions of community members regarding
   COVID-19 vaccination. Methods The study used a mixed-methods approach.
   Respondents (n = 183) were surveyed with a web-based questionnaire. They
   were asked whether there would get vaccinated for COVID-19 barring any
   access or cost-related challenges. Perceptions of community members
   regarding vaccination were explored through one-on-one interviews (n =
   30) and eight focus groups (n = 49), with participants drawn from across
   various demographic characteristics. Survey responses were summarized
   using frequencies and proportions. A thematic analysis was conducted on
   the qualitative data. Results Thirty-four percent of respondents
   indicated ``Yes{''} (willing to get vaccinated); 26.8\% indicated
   ``No{''}, while 37.1\% expressed hesitancy ({''}Maybe{''} or ``I don't
   know{''}). Themes emerging from the qualitative data are grouped into
   three broad categories: vaccine accessibility (transportation,
   information, navigating healthcare system); vaccine hesitancy (with
   sub-categories of compliance, complacency and confidence); and vaccine
   ``resistance{''} (conspiracy theories, conflicting beliefs, distrust of
   Government, trustworthiness of Health care). Conclusion Findings
   demonstrate a nuanced expansion of ``vaccine hesitancy{''} to delineate
   groups with varying issues and perspectives. Interventions to enhance
   vaccination rates in Black/African-American communities should
   incorporate components that assure accessibility at the minimum, but
   also address non-access-related issues. Priority should be given to
   enhancing vaccine literacy, information-sharing as efficacy and safety
   data emerge, and addressing specific concerns identified through
   community-engaged outreach efforts.},

Abstract = {The study is dedicated to the emergence of the Russian Arctic politics
   language which is considered as a set of specific idioms, rhetoric,
   grammars, and categories. The formation of the Russian Arctic politics
   language took place during drastic transformations of Russian public and
   civil political life in the 1860s and 1870s. As any political language,
   it developed through discussions on political matters: political
   economy, international relations, and law. Moreover, as every political
   language, it became an instrument for rationalizing and constructing
   reality. The rhetoric and pragmatics of the ``Russian North
   protectors{''}, such as manufacturers V.N. Latkin, M.K. Sidorov, public
   persons V.L. Dolinskiy, D.L. Mordovtsev, and others, are analyzed in the
   article. Attempting to gain governmental support for their business
   projects and promoting the position of ``state international policy{''},
   they developed an alarmist conspiracy method of speech (discourse) about
   the North of Russia, making themselves closer to the dynamically forming
   conservative nationalist opposition to the liberal reforms. From that
   perspective, the ``Northern question{''} was constructed as one of weak
   points of the liberal government. Idiomatic and speech constructions of
   the ``Russian North protectors{''} were grounded on the thesis about the
   threat of alienation of the North of Russia. In the 1860s, this
   resonated with the moral panic originated from the Polish riots of
   1863-1864 concerning the ``disruption{''} of the wholeness of the
   Russian state, and with the ``military anxiety{''} provoked by the
   eastern crisis of 1875-1876 in the next decade. The author concludes
   that the key part in forming the Russian Arctic politics language was
   played by society, which, however, failed to include the ``North
   question{''} in the current Russian agenda.},

Abstract = {Since young age, Jan Kakolewski was fascinated with scouting; he was
   among the chief conspirators in the region of Wielkopolska at the end of
   the partitions of Poland. He was raised in the spirit of solidarity,
   devotion to the mother country, armed struggle for Poland's independence
   and hope for a better future. When the Wielkopolska uprising broke out
   on 27 December 1918, he was at the epicentre of events, fought against
   Germans to liberate the city of Poznan and subsequently led troops which
   were part of the northern front of the Wielkopolska uprising, fighting
   in the vicinity of Kcynia. Since 18 October 1919, he fought in the 6th
   infantry regiment of the Legions in the Lithuania n-Belarus Front where
   he was in command of 2nd Company. lie also took part in the
   Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920. In the Second Polish Republic, by 1933
   he served as a professional soldier. During WWII he was member of the
   armed independence conspiracy around Warsaw, Bialystok and Krakow. After
   1945 he strived to survive communism and support his family, working for
   example as a farmer. During the Polish October of 1956, he embraced
   another cause, namely securing the interests of the veterans of the
   Wielkopolska uprising. On 3 May 1976, during the jubilee celebrations of
   600 years of the monastery of the Order of Saint Paul (1382-1982) and
   the presence of the image of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa he was
   among the generals who deposited their most precious medals as a symbol
   of their gratitude to Our Lady for her presence in Poland's struggle for

Abstract = {The article discusses the application of one particular tool
   international criminal. tribunals may use in order to bolster their
   perceived legitimacy: consistent resort to domestic criminal law (DCL).
   Arguably, legitimacy concerns affect decisions by tribunals to invoke
   DCL, as well as the manner in which DCL is applied. After presenting a
   general analysis of the pros and cons of the utilization of DCL from a
   legitimacy perspective (a discussion informed by some of the literature
   on comparative law), and after introducing a typology of possible uses
   of DCL by international criminal tribunals, the article explores three
   case studies involving reliance on DCL or lack thereof: (1) The
   invocation of a common plan or conspiracy by the Nuremberg Tribunal and
   the subsequent treatment of the joint Criminal Enterprise doctrine by
   the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY),
   the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), the Extraordinary
   Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia and the International Criminal Court;
   (2) the incorporation of domestic sentencing standards in the case law
   of ICTY and ICTR; and (3) the decision by the Special Court for Sierra
   Leone not to utilize in its work domestic Sierra Leone criminal law
   (notwithstanding the authorization found in its Statute). Through a
   discussion of these cases, I try to speculate upon the tribunals'
   motivations in employing DCL in the first place, and in selecting
   between different sources of DCL (particularly, in choosing the
   countries whose laws are to be consulted). On the basis of this
   discussion, I will attempt to map the different functions which the
   invocation of DCL may fulfil in the work of international criminal
   tribunals.},

Abstract = {The Sc spiral, NGC 450 (v0 = 1863 km s-1) has conspicuously brighter H
   II regions at just the point o projected contact with the spiral UGC 807
   (v0 = 11,600 km s-1). New spectra and photometry are reported which show
   the following:
   1. The rotation curve of the low-redshift spiral has asymmetries and
   large discontinuities.
   2. The brightest H ii regions show differences between them of the order
   of 100 km s-1, and one knot shows a discrepancy of 400 km s-1, well in
   excess of escape velocity.
   3. The distribution of neutral hydrogen in NGC 450 is heavily
   overbalanced to the side of the bright knots and the position of UGC
   807.
   4. The rotation curve of the high-redshift spiral shows a shallow
   increase to maximum rotational velocity (v(max) = 171 km s-1) which is
   characteristic of lower luminosity spirals. The rotation curve is also
   asymmetric and shows irregularities.
   5. The relative Halpha surface brightness, a distance-independent
   quantity, signifies currently enhanced star formation in UGC 807. The
   Halpha luminosity of the higher redshift spiral is unprecedentedly large
   if placed at its redshift distance.
   6. The morphology of the higher redshift spiral is more extended on the
   side toward NGC 450 than on the side away and the color index isocontour
   lines indicate a discontinuity where the UGC 807 image merges well that
   of NGC 450.
   The conclusion from the extensive analysis is that one would have to
   invoke an enormous conspiracy of accidents in order to avoid the
   conclusion that UGC 807 is a moderately low luminosity galaxy
   interacting with NGC 450.},

Title = {Political Preferences, Knowledge, and Misinformation About COVID-19: The
   Case of Brazil},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a vast research agenda focusing on how
   citizens acquire knowledge about the virus and the health expert
   guidelines to protect themselves and their close ones against it. While
   many countries and regions have been accounted for, there still remains
   a substantial gap with respect to public opinion about the virus in
   Latin America, most notably in Brazil, which currently has the second
   highest in number of fatalities in the world. In this article, we employ
   a national survey of Brazilians (n = 2,771) to measure and explain
   knowledge and misinformation about the coronavirus and its illness,
   COVID-19. Our focus concerns the role of political preferences in a
   context of high elite polarization with a sitting government that has
   systematically downplayed the risks associated with the coronavirus and
   its illness. Our findings are clear: political preferences play a
   substantial role in explaining differences in knowledge about the
   coronavirus and COVID-19, more than conventional determinants of
   learning like motivation, ability, and opportunities. Specifically, we
   find that supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro-an avid science and
   COVID-19 denier-know significantly less about the coronavirus and its
   illness and are more likely to believe in a conspiracy theory that
   claims that the coronavirus was purposefully created in a Chinese
   laboratory to promote China's economic power, when compared to
   Brazilians who are less supportive of him and his government. Our
   findings carry important implications for how Brazilians take
   informational cues from political elites in that-even in a major event
   like a global pandemic-supporters of the president are as likely as ever
   to ``follow their leader{''} and deny expert-backed scientific evidence.},

Abstract = {The majority of accounts of the Second World War have described Nazi
   Germany as an uncontrollable monster with a highly industrialized
   economy. But what if it was not so? What if the European tragedy was not
   rooted in Germany's strength, but in its weakness?
   Adam Tooze has written a radically new history of the Second World War.
   The author achieved this by taking into account racial relations and
   politics, with special attention focused on economy. Understanding of
   the global economy played a critical role in Hitler's views. He guessed
   that Germany's relative poverty in 1933 was conditioned by not only the
   Great Depression but also limitations of its territory and natural
   resources. He foresaw a rise of a new globalized world where Europe
   would be pressed by the unbreakable power of America. There was a last
   chance: the European superstate led by Germany.
   However, the global balance of economic and military forces did not
   initially favor of Hitler. With the purpose of preventing the threat
   from the West, he sent his poorly armed troops to conquer Europe which
   led to the crash of his intentions. Even in the summer of 1940, a time
   of Germany's great triumphs, Hitler was worried about America's air and
   maritime domination, which he was convinced was the result of a Jewish
   conspiracy.
   As soon as the Wehrmacht came into Soviet territory, the war turned into
   a battle of attrition without any hope of Germany's winning. Because
   Hitler and others did not accept this, the Third Reich was destroyed at
   the cost of millions of lives.},

Abstract = {Objective: To provide strategies for immunization advocates on how best
   to participate in online discussion forums about immunization.
   Methods: Content and thematic analysis of an online discussion forum
   held following the national screening of a documentary about the
   measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism scare. A subsample of
   branches containing more than 20 posts was analysed. Each distinct
   message (a ``post{''}) was coded for the author's manifest position on
   immunization, author type, topic, and evidence presented or sought.
   Results: From 103 distinct branches there were 1193 posts sent over a
   31/2 h period. We selected the 13 longest branches containing 466 posts
   from 166 individuals. One third of these individuals were explicitly
   critical of MMR immunization and one third sought information. The
   remainder were ambivalent but seeking no information (5\%), supportive
   (14\%), or unstated (15\%). Among five author categories, only 4\%
   identified themselves as health professionals. Topics included alleged
   adverse effects of immunization (35\%); autism spectrum disorders
   treatment and causes (31\%); vaccine ingredients (12\%); a conspiracy
   (9\%); immunization policies (8\%); and measles, mumps or rubella (4\%).
   Scientific concepts of evidence failed to compete with lay concepts and
   personal anecdotes prevailed.
   Conclusions: Health professionals and other advocates of immunization
   should engage in similar types of post-broadcast online discussion
   forums in a planned and strategic manner that accounts for the decision
   processes of lay people. This involves expanding and diversifying the
   support base of people contributing to the forum; setting the agenda;
   introducing messages known to influence behaviour; not overselling
   vaccination; and avoiding personal attacks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {H1N1v influenza vaccine in Greek medical students},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {329-332},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: We sought to investigate the penetration of the H1N1v
   vaccine in Greek medical students, as well as their approach to the
   vaccination. Methods: A survey was conducted among the students of the
   University of Athens, School of Medicine, 1 month after the initiation
   of the vaccination programme. Participants were asked to fill in a
   questionnaire regarding their status of vaccination and their approach
   to the H1N1v vaccine. Results: We handed a questionnaire to 1000
   students (out of 1700 officially enrolled in the medical school) and
   retrieved 922 answers. Only 74 (8\%) medical students had been
   vaccinated and 78 (9\%) planned to (probably or definitely) do so in the
   future, while 641 (67\%) would (probably or definitely) not get
   vaccinated. The highest coverage was among the sixth year students
   (37/234, 16\%). The most common reasons for not having received the
   vaccine were perception of the disease as mild (387/848, 46\%), and
   concern regarding long-term adverse events (370/848, 44\%). Thirty
   percent (258/848) of the students doubted the vaccine's effectiveness,
   and 197 (23\%) worried about possible short-term adverse events. One
   hundred and thirty-three respondents (16\%) believed the whole story is
   a conspiracy while 102 (12\%) reported to have had the flu. Almost half
   (43\%) of the participants considered their knowledge on the subject
   inadequate. Conclusion: Our findings confirmed the low penetration of
   the H1N1 vaccine in Greece, as in most European countries, even in
   medical students. Better education of the students and the public might
   aid in increasing the immunization rates.},

Title = {Car buyers and fuel economy?},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This research is designed to help researchers and policy makers ground
   their work in the reality of how US consumers are thinking and behaving
   with respect to automotive fuel economy. Our data are from
   semi-structured interviews with 57 households across nine
   lifestyle..sectors.{''} We found no household that analyzed their fuel
   costs in a systematic way in their automobile or gasoline, purchases.
   Almost none of these households track gasoline costs over time or
   consider them explicitly in household budgets. These households may know
   the cost of their last tank of gasoline and the unit price of gasoline
   on that day, but this accurate information is rapidly forgotten and
   replaced by typical information. One effect of this lack of knowledge
   and information is that when consumers buy a vehicle, they do not have
   the basic building blocks of knowledge assumed by the model of
   economically rational decision-making, and they make large errors
   estimating gasoline costs and savings over time.
   Moreover, we find that consumer value for fuel economy is not only about
   private cost savings. Fuel economy can be a symbolic value as well, for
   example among drivers who view resource conservation or thrift as
   important values to communicate. Consumers also assign non-monetary
   meaning to fuel prices, for example seeing rising prices as evidence of
   conspiracy. This research suggests that consumer responses to fuel
   economy technology and changes in fuel prices are more complex than
   economic assumptions suggest. The US Department of Energy and the Energy
   Foundation supported this research. The authors are solely responsible
   for the content and conclusions presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Does highlighting COVID-19 disparities reduce or increase vaccine
   intentions? evidence from a survey experiment in a diverse sample in New
   York State prior to vaccine roll-out},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {Racial identity and political partisanship have emerged as two important
   social correlates of hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines in the United
   States. To examine the relationship of these factors with respondents'
   intention to vaccinate before the vaccine was available
   (November/December, 2020), we employed a multi-method approach: a survey
   experiment that randomized a vaccine-promotion message focused on racial
   equity in vaccine targeting, stepwise regression to identify predictors
   of hesitancy, and qualitative analysis of open-ended survey questions
   that capture how respondents reason about vaccination intentions.
   Experimental manipulation of a racial equity vaccine promotion message
   via an online survey experiment had no effect on intention-to-vaccinate
   in the full sample or in racial, ethnic and partisan subsamples.
   Descriptively, we find heightened hesitancy among non-Hispanic Black
   respondents (OR = 1.82, p<0.01), Hispanics (OR = 1.37, p<0.05), Trump
   voters (OR = 1.74, p<0.01) and non-Voters/vote Other (OR = 1.50, p<0.01)
   compared with non-Hispanic White respondents and Biden voters. Lower
   trust in institutions, individualism and alternative media use accounted
   for heightened hesitancy in Trump voters, but not non-Hispanic Blacks
   and Hispanics. Older age and female gender identity also persistently
   predicted lower vaccine intentions. Qualitatively, we find that most
   hesitant responders wanted to `wait-and-see,' driven by generalized
   concerns about the speed of vaccine development, and potential vaccine
   side-effects, but little mention of conspiracy theories. Identity
   appears to be an important driver of vaccinate hesitancy that is not
   fully explained by underlying socioeconomic or attitudinal factors;
   furthermore, hesitancy was not significantly affected by racial equity
   messages in this setting.},

Abstract = {In the first year of the Republic there was a conspiracy which failed
   because a slave reported it to the authorities. As a reward he received
   a sum of money and was granted his freedom as well as Roman citizenship.
   The historian Livy claims that this was the first time a slave was freed
   through the procedure of manumissio vindicta, and that the ceremony
   derived its name from the slave in question: Vindicius. Many scholars
   have pointed out that the story is unlikely to be historically accurate.
   Instead of demonstrating the accuracy or inaccuracy of Livy's story,
   however, the present study wants to suggest that in addition to
   providing an etymological explanation for a key procedure in the
   manumission of slaves Livy may have aimed to present the story as a
   specific deserving case of the granting of freedom and citizenship. This
   should be understood against the backdrop of the turbulent times that
   Livy's readers had recently experienced and the attempts by Augustus to
   re-energize Rome's destiny on the firm footing of its past moral
   foundations. Within this perspective Vindicius' act of story may be
   viewed as an essential contribution to the freedom of the Roman people.
   Livy achieves this above all by screening out the fact that in order to
   save the state Vindicius has to betray his own familia. This aspect
   receives additional importance against the many examples in the history
   of the first century BC of slaves betraying their masters for money.
   Vindicius' stance is ideologically correct and therefore in agreement
   with the Roman perception of the good slave.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of
   perceptions on the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life and suicidal
   ideation in both healthy controls and individuals with psychiatric
   disorders.
   Method: The study was conducted on 4 different groups with 83 depressive
   disorders, 90 anxiety disorders and 61 schizophrenia patients who have
   been followed in Gazi University Medical Faculty Hospital Mental Health
   and Diseases outpatient clinic since before the COVID-19 pandemic period
   and another group of 93 healthy volunteers. Participants were evaluated
   with Sociodemographic Data Form, Suicide Probability Scale (SPS), SF-36
   Quality of Life Scale (SF36), Perception of COVID-19 Scale (P-COVID-19),
   and Perception of Causes of COVID-19 Scale (PCa-COVID-19).
   Results: The perception on the danger and contaigiousness of P-COVID-19
   scored lowest in the schizophrenia group, compared to other groups and
   PCa-COVID-19's Conspiracy and Belief subdimension scores were highest.
   In all groups, a significant negative correlation was found between the
   P-COVID-19's dangerousness subdimension score and the SF-36 scale's
   Mental Health sub-dimension. Again, in all groups, significant positive
   correlations were found between the Dangerousness sub-dimension score of
   P-COVID-19 and the anger/impulsivity, hopelessness/loneliness and
   suicidal thoughts sub-dimensions of the SPS.
   Conclusion: The negative effects of perceptions associated with COVID-19
   on mental health were observed both in groups with a psychiatric
   disorder and in healthy controls. The higher number of participants and
   longitudinal research will provide a better understanding of the effects
   of perceptions associated with COVID-19 and will guide the necessary
   treatment interventions.},

Title = {Assessing Public Awareness of the Malaria Vaccine in Sub-Saharan Africa},
Journal = {TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Malaria infection remains one of the leading causes of death
   in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years, several measures have been
   implemented for the prevention of malaria, including vector control with
   insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying, and seasonal or
   traveling prophylactics. In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO)
   approved the use of the malaria vaccine in children. We conducted a
   cross-sectional survey study in three sub-Saharan African
   countries-Uganda, Ghana, and Nigeria-to assess public awareness of the
   malaria vaccine among the residents of these countries. Method: A
   cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted between time January
   2022 and April 2022 using Qualtrics (R) software (Version number: April
   2022; Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA). A total of 3896 responses were
   analyzed using SAS OnDemand for Academics software. Linear regression
   model was used to assess the relationship between the demographic
   characteristics and awareness of the malaria vaccine, using a level of
   significance (alpha) of 0.05. Result: Overall, there was significant
   association between the level of education and public awareness of the
   malaria vaccine in each of the countries studied. Gender and place of
   residence were associated with awareness in Nigeria and Uganda, while
   younger respondents were more likely to be aware of the malaria vaccine
   in Ghana. Conclusion: Given the negative impact of lack of awareness and
   knowledge, misinformation and conspiracy theories on immunization
   programs, public health campaigns preceding the population-wide roll-out
   of the novel malaria vaccine should target the less-educated, and those
   residing in more rural areas, while assuring equitable access to the
   malaria vaccine across sub-Saharan Africa.},

Title = {Knowledge and Awareness of Algerian Students about Cervical Cancer, HPV
   and HPV Vaccines: A Cross-Sectional Study},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cervical cancer is one of the most recurrent and dangerous female
   cancers in Algeria and worldwide. It is mainly caused by human
   papillomaviruses (HPV), which can induce other cancers as well. Although
   it can be fatal, cervical cancer is one of the most preventable and
   manageable cancers. While HPV vaccination is the key weapon to win the
   battle against this pathology, it is still not approved in Algeria.
   Therefore, we set up a cross-sectional survey to assess the knowledge
   and awareness of students from Algerian universities concerning cervical
   cancer and HPV and to understand their attitudes towards HPV
   vaccination. The results reveal that, out of 715 students, the majority
   of students were aware of cervical cancer (84.6\%). However, only 46.2\%
   of students had heard about HPV. Furthermore, willingness to get the HPV
   vaccine was estimated at 26.7\% among students with prior knowledge of
   HPV, and 21.5\% of these students claimed to be willing to pay to get
   the HPV vaccine if available. Nevertheless, HPV vaccine hesitancy was
   estimated at 37.5\% among the students aware of HPV. The main causes of
   HPV vaccine reluctance were: complacency (30.6\%), refusal of
   vaccination in general (20.2\%) and belief in the rarity of HPV-induced
   infections in Algeria (19.4\%). Moreover, the embrace of vaccine
   conspiracy beliefs among students were significantly related with their
   HPV vaccine rejection. Overall, these findings encourage the
   establishment of a social education policy concerning the fight against
   HPV-induced cancers, particularly that of the cervix, and the
   implementation of a national HPV vaccination program targeting young
   people.},

Title = {Multimedia Fusion Privacy Protection Algorithm Based on IoT Data
   Security under Network Regulations},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {This study provides an in-depth analysis and research on multimedia
   fusion privacy protection algorithms based on IoT data security in a
   network regulation environment. Aiming at the problem of collusion and
   conspiracy to deceive users in the process of outsourced computing and
   outsourced verification, a safe, reliable, and collusion-resistant
   scheme based on blockchain is studied for IoT outsourced data computing
   and public verification, with the help of distributed storage methods,
   where smart devices encrypt the collected data and upload them to the
   DHT for storage along with the results of this data given by the cloud
   server. After testing, the constructed model has a privacy-preserving
   budget value of 0.6 and the smallest information leakage ratio of
   multimedia fusion data based on IoT data security when the decision tree
   depth is 6. After using this model under this condition, the maximum
   value of the information leakage ratio of multimedia fusion data based
   on IoT data security is reduced from 0.0865 to 0.003, and the data
   security is significantly improved. In the consensus verification
   process, to reduce the consensus time and ensure the operating
   efficiency of the system, a consensus node selection algorithm is
   proposed, thereby reducing the time complexity of the consensus. Based
   on the smart grid application scenario, the security and performance of
   the proposed model are analyzed. This study proves the correctness of
   this scheme by using BAN logic and proves the security of this scheme
   under the stochastic prediction machine model. Finally, this study
   compares the security aspects and performance aspects of the scheme with
   some existing similar schemes and shows that the scheme is feasible
   under IoT.},

Title = {Multi-Ideology Multi-Class Extremism Classification Using Deep Learning
   Techniques},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {104829-104843},
Abstract = {Social media is an integral part of today's social communication. Social
   media platforms have a global reach with immense popularity among the
   young generation. This reach and influencing power of social media has
   attracted extremist and terrorist organizations to social media
   platforms. Numerous terrorist organizations like ISIS, Taliban,
   Al-Qaeda, and Proud Boys and conspiracy theory groups like Alt-Right and
   QAnon spread their propaganda, radicalize and recruit youths via social
   media platforms. Thus, online extremism research is imperative to
   monitor extremists' influence and their spread of hate on social media.
   The existing research is limited to the specific ideology, which results
   in a bias towards a particular ideology. The classification of extremism
   is presented only in binary or tertiary classes with no further
   insights. This research work presents the development of a seed dataset
   and balanced multi-ideology extremism text dataset with multi-class
   labels. Recently natural language processing with deep learning has
   gained significant attention in extremism detection research. Thus this
   research focuses on collecting, cleaning and classifying the extremist
   tweets. This study presents a multi-class classification of the balanced
   multi-ideology dataset. This dataset is termed Merged Islamic State of
   Iraq and Syria (ISIS) /Jihadist-White Supremacist (MIWS). The MIWS
   dataset is evaluated using pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder
   Representation for Transformers (BERT) and variants like Robustly
   Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) and DistilBERT and
   achieves the highest f1-score of 0.72. RoBERTa and DistilBERT provide
   f1-score of 0.68 and 0.71, respectively. Thus, deep learning can be
   effectively used to identify extremism from multiple ideologies and
   segregate them into propaganda, radicalization and recruitment.},

Abstract = {Having emerged in a global world with its high cross-border population
   mobility, the COVID-19 pandemic could not but affect the basic
   characteristics of this process. Almost everywhere, partial or complete
   restrictions on movements between countries and within individual
   nations have been recognized as one of the most effective means of
   combating the spread of the infection. This resulted in a broad blocking
   of tourist flows and business trips, as well as in the increased
   difficulties of students studying abroad and the serious reduction of
   labour mobility. The problems associated with the need to regulate
   migration flows in emergency conditions are considered in the article
   using the example of two - at first glance different, but in fact
   clearly overlapping - country cases. The selection of Italy and Sweden
   is not accidental. These nations have demonstrated both similarities and
   differences in the objective circumstances and subjective factors that
   determined their chosen strategies to combat the pandemic and the
   priorities of their migration policies. The deep differences in
   socio-cultural traditions and the dissimilarity of these strategies
   between the two countries are reflected, in particular, in the divergent
   impact of COVID-19 and its consequences on social cohesion, weakening it
   in Italy and strengthening it in Sweden. The increased relevance of the
   problem of migration in the mass consciousness that associated with the
   coronavirus pandemic is fraught with the emergence and spread of
   erroneous stereotypes, philistine phobias, and conspiracy theories. This
   explains the revival of the tendency to strengthen the role of
   anti-immigrant populist and nationalist parties and movements, which may
   lead to a corresponding change in the configuration and balance of
   political forces.},

Abstract = {As climate change increases the frequency and severity of disasters, and
   population and social changes raise the public's vulnerability to
   disaster events, societies face additional risk of multiple disaster
   events or other hazards occurring simultaneously. Such hazards involve
   significant uncertainty, which must be translated into concrete plans
   able to be implemented by disaster workers. Little research has explored
   how disaster managers incorporate different forms of knowledge and
   uncertainty into preparations for simultaneous hazards or disaster
   events, or how front-line disaster workers respond to and implement
   these plans. In this paper I draw on ethnographic research working as a
   wildland firefighter, interviews with firefighters and fire managers,
   and state and agency planning documents to examine preparations for two
   events occurring in Central Oregon in August 2017: (1) the height of
   wildfire season and (2) hundreds of thousands of anticipated visitors
   for a total solar eclipse. I find that different qualities of risk,
   hazard, and uncertainty across these two events were central to the
   development and implementation of disaster plans. Agency leaders devised
   worst-case scenario plans for the eclipse based on uncertain predictions
   regarding hazards from the eclipse and the occurrence of severe
   wildfires, aiming to eliminate the potential for unknown hazards. These
   plans were generally met with skepticism by front-line disaster workers.
   Despite the uncertainties that dominated eclipse-planning rhetoric,
   firefighters largely identified risks from the eclipse that were risks
   they dealt with in their daily work as firefighters. I conclude by
   discussing implications of these findings for conceptual understandings
   of disaster planning as well as contemporary concerns about skepticism
   and conspiracy theories directed at government planning and response to
   disaster events.},

Title = {LOST IN THE MEDIASCAPE: EMBRACING UNCERTAINTIES AND CONTRADICTIONS AT
   THE CULTURAL NEXUS OF CRIME AND MEDIA},
Booktitle = {THEORIZING CRIMINALITY AND POLICING IN THE DIGITAL MEDIA AGE},
Series = {Studies in Media and Communications},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {151-167},
Abstract = {Purpose: In this chapter, the authors posit that, shadowing the
   etiological crises in criminology, much crime media scholarship remains
   ``lost in the mediascape.{''} The authors outline why dominant
   positivist methodologies in crime media scholarship leave us lost and
   offer tools that researchers may use for better wayfinding in this
   complex and dynamic environment.
   Methodology/approach: Drawing on the concept of liquid criminology, the
   authors join a growing chorus in the crime media field calling for
   methodological and theoretical concepts more reflective of the social
   dimensions of liquid modernity, that is, uncertainty, ambiguity,
   impermanence, precarity, etc.
   Findings: The conditions of liquid modernity inform a mediascape
   characterized by an abundance of data, misinformation, disinformation,
   propaganda, and conspiracy theories resulting in collective
   disorientation and the inability to form coherent narratives about the
   past, present, or future. As such, these conditions defy positivistic
   conventions like representative sampling and demand new, imaginative
   approaches to the study of crime media. To that end, informed by the
   cultural criminological perspective, the authors offer two methodologies
   and one theoretical concept.
   Research limitations: The authors believe our methodological and
   theoretical suggestions are best suited for analyzing themes and
   concepts among discourse around crime incidents that have significant
   legal and social implications. The authors offer no definitive answers,
   but hope to begin building a better toolbox for wayfinding in this
   digital wilderness.
   Originality/value: The currently dominant methodology within crime media
   scholarship is a poor fit with contemporary media culture. Here, the
   authors begin to remedy that by proposing an orientation that fits
   better with the fluid, uncertain, and dynamic media environment that
   permeates our social world.},

Abstract = {The evidence of waning immunity offered by COVID-19 vaccines suggests
   that widespread and regular uptake of routine COVID-19 booster vaccines
   will be needed. In order to understand the hesitancy toward COVID-19
   boosters, we examined the barriers and facilitators to receiving regular
   COVID-19 boosters in a sample of young adults in the UK. A
   cross-sectional survey was completed by 423 participants (M = 22.8; SD =
   8.6 years) and assessed intention to receive regular COVID-19 boosters,
   the 7C antecedents of vaccination (i.e. confidence, complacency,
   constraints, calculation, collective responsibility, and compliance and
   conspiracy), and any previous experience of side-effects from COVID-19
   vaccines. Participants also provided a free text qualitative response
   outlining their barriers and facilitators to receiving regular COVID-19
   boosters. Overall, 42.8\% of the sample were hesitant about receiving
   regular COVID-19 boosters. Multivariate logistic regression analysis
   showed that intention to accept future boosters was associated with
   having higher levels of confidence in, and compliance with, vaccines,
   lower levels of complacency, calculation and perceptions of constraints
   to vaccination, and having experienced less severe side effects from the
   COVID-19 vaccines. Qualitative responses highlighted the main barriers
   included experiencing side effects with previous COVID-19 vaccines and
   inaccessibility of vaccination services. Key facilitators included
   protecting the health of friends and family members, protecting personal
   health, and maintaining regular activities. Our findings suggest that
   interventions targeted at increasing booster uptake should address the
   experience of side effects while also emphasizing the positive vaccine
   benefits relating to the individual's health and the maintenance of
   their regular work and social activities.},

Title = {Nationalism and anti-ethno-politics: why `Chinese Development' failed at
   Myanmar's Myitsone Dam},
Journal = {EURASIAN GEOGRAPHY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {374-402},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In 2011, the Burmese military-backed government stunned global audiences
   by unilaterally suspending the construction of the Myitsone Dam, the
   cornerstone of China's largest hydropower project abroad. This prominent
   failure of China's Going Out investment strategy reverberated globally.
   Both Western and Chinese accounts frame the event as a pivotal moment in
   Myanmar's celebrated reform process, the cooling of China-Myanmar
   relations, and US-China geopolitical rivalry in the Asia-Pacific.
   However, my ethnographic field and media research from 2010 to 2015
   reveals that the mega-project's failure does not originally stem from
   inter-state geopolitics or contested economics and ecology. Through
   chronological narration, I show how the Myitsone Dam is primarily the
   casualty of a distinctly ethno-political causality, whereby three
   nationalisms clashed and the replication of China's anti-ethno-political
   model of development failed. Though no monolithic Chinese state directs
   Chinese Development overseas, individual Chinese entrepreneurs
   nonetheless draw from the People's Republic of China's (PRC's)
   anti-political and state-centric paradigm when facing foreign social
   worlds. In the particular case of Myitsone, Chinese proponents drew from
   PRC's state-nationalist heuristics of national minorities and state-led
   development and Western anti-China conspiracy, when facing Myanmar's
   ethnic Kachin and Burman nationalisms. State ideological subjectivities
   of these developers seemed to blind them to the weakness in their own
   anti-ethno-political strategies, even when those collapsed publicly. I
   conclude that the Myitsone Dam's construction will likely not be
   restarted, despite the hydropower company's efforts. The Myitsone case
   also exemplifies how China's previous historical entanglements in its
   neighboring regions uniquely disrupt the progress of Going-Out in Asia.},

Abstract = {In Uganda, curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS has largely depended on public
   and private media messages about the disease. Media campaigns based on
   Uganda's cultural norms of communication are metaphorical, analogical
   and simile-like. The topic of HIV/AIDS has been introduced into the
   Senior Three (Grade 11) biology curriculum in Uganda. To what extent do
   students' pre-conceptions of the disease, based on these media messages
   influence students' development of conceptual understanding of the
   disease, its transmission and prevention? Of significant importance is
   the impact the conceptions students have developed from the indirect
   media messages on classroom instruction on HIV/AIDS. The study is based
   in a theoretical framework of conceptual change in science learning. An
   interpretive case study to determine the impact of Ugandan students'
   conceptions or perceptions on classroom instruction about HIV/AIDS,
   involving 160 students aged 15-17, was conducted in four different
   Ugandan high schools: girls boarding, boys boarding, mixed boarding, and
   mixed day. Using questionnaires, focus group discussions, recorded
   biology lessons and informal interviews, students' preconceptions of
   HIV/AIDS and how these impact lessons on HIV/AIDS were discerned. These
   preconceptions fall into four main categories: religious, political,
   conspiracy and traditional African worldviews. Results of data analysis
   suggest that students' prior knowledge is persistent even after biology
   instructions. This has implications for current teaching approaches,
   which are mostly teacher-centred in Ugandan schools. A rethinking of the
   curriculum with the intent of offering science education programs that
   promote understanding of the science of HIV/AIDS as opposed to what is
   happening now-insensitivity to misconceptions about the disease-is
   needed.},

Abstract = {The concept of artificial intelligence was first introduced in 1955 with
   the official proposal letter of the Dartmouth Summer Research Project
   prepared in Dartmouth College. With time and developments in artificial
   intelligence technology, the use of this concept has gained increasing
   popularity. Today, the effects of artificial intelligence, particularly
   on human rights, are being increasingly discussed in international
   meetings held between many states such as United Kingdom, France etc.
   The development of artificial intelligence technology and its
   integration in our lives has brought several conspiracy theories. Some
   people perceive it as a threat, whereas others see it as a useful
   technology for humanity. Artificial intelligence contributes to
   significant developments in several fields such as technology, health,
   and education. Similarly, it may contribute to the further improvement
   of human rights. However, its negative effects on human rights cannot be
   ignored. Identifying and eliminating such negative effects will also
   result in the prevention of human right violations. Considering the
   aforementioned reasons, it is essential to consider the positive and
   negative effects of artificial intelligence on human rights. In this
   study, first, the concept of artificial intelligence is detailed. Then,
   types of artificial intelligence based on their developments are
   discussed. Next, the artificial intelligence law is examined in the
   context of human rights and subsequently, the effects of artificial
   intelligence applications on human rights are detailed. Finally, the
   artificial intelligence applications are discussed in terms of some
   fundamental rights and freedoms. In this framework, the effects of
   artificial intelligence applications on the ``right to life,{''} ``right
   to a fair trial,{''} ``right to respect private and family life,{''}
   ``freedom of expression,{''} and ``principle of equality and prohibition
   of discrimination{''} are evaluated.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the new
   coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the globe with unprecedented
   consequences for the health of millions of people. While the pandemic is
   still in progress, with new incidents being reported every day, the
   resilience of the global society is constantly being challenged. Under
   these circumstances, the future seems uncertain. SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus
   has spread panic among civilians and insecurity at all socio-political
   and economic levels, dramatically disrupting everyday life, global
   economy, international travel and trade. The disease has also been
   linked to the onset of depression in many individuals due to the extreme
   restriction measures that have been taken for the prevention of the
   rapid spreading of COVID-19. First, the socio-economic, political and
   psychological implications of the COVID-19 pandemic were explored.
   Substantial evidence is provided for the consequences of the pandemic on
   all aspects of everyday life, while at the same time we unravel the role
   and the pursuits of national regimes during this unforeseen situation.
   The second goal of this review is related to the scientific aspect of
   the pandemic. Hence, we explain why SARS-CoV-2 is not a so-called
   `invisible enemy', and also attempt to give insight regarding the origin
   of the virus, in an effort to reject the conspiracy theories that have
   arisen during the pandemic. Finally, rational strategies were
   investigated for successful vaccine development. We are optimistic that
   this review will complement the knowledge of specialized scientists and
   inform non-specialized readers on basic scientific questions, and also
   on the social and economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Recent terrorist events in the UK, such as the security alerts at
   British airports in August 2006 and the London bombings of July 2005
   gained extensive media and academic analysis. This study contends,
   however, that much of the commentary demonstrated a wide degree of
   failure among government agencies, academic and analytic experts and the
   wider media, about the nature of the threat and continues to distort
   comprehension of the extant danger. The principal failure, this argument
   maintains, was, and continues to be, one of an asymmetry of
   comprehension that mistakes the still relatively limited means of
   violent jihadist radicals with limited political ends. The
   misapprehension often stems from the language that surrounds the idea of
   `terrorism', which increasingly restricts debate to an intellectually
   redundant search for the `root causes' that give rise to the politics of
   complacency. In recent times this outlook has consistently
   underestimated the level of the threat to the security of the UK. This
   article argues that a more realistic appreciation of the current
   security condition requires abandoning the prevailing view that the
   domestic threat is best prosecuted as a criminal conspiracy. It demands
   instead a total strategy to deal with a totalizing threat. The empirical
   evidence demonstrates the existence of a physical threat, not merely the
   political fear of threat. The implementation of a coherent set of social
   policies for confronting the threat at home recognizes that securing
   state borders and maintaining internal stability are the first tasks of
   government. Fundamentally, this requires a return to an understanding of
   the Hobbesian conditions for sovereignty, which, despite the delusions
   of post-Cold War cosmopolitan multiculturalism, never went away.},

Title = {Gunshot-wound dynamics model for John F. Kennedy assassination},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in an open
   motorcade by a sniper in Dallas, Texas on 22 November 1963. A civilian
   bystander, Mr. Abraham Zapruder, filmed the motorcade with a 8-mm home
   movie camera as it drove through Dealey Plaza, inadvertently recording
   an approximate to 8 second sequence of events that included a fatal
   gunshot wound to the President in the head. The accompanying backward
   motion of the President's head after impact appeared to support later
   ``conspiracy theories{''} because it was claimed that this was proof of
   a shot from the front (in addition to one from behind). In this paper,
   simple one-dimensional dynamical models are uniquely applied to study in
   detail the fatal shot and the motion of the President's head observed in
   the film. Using known parameters from the crime scene, explicit force
   calculations are carried out for determining the projectile's
   retardation during tissue passage along with the resulting transfer of
   momentum and kinetic energy (KE). The computed instantaneous KE transfer
   within the soft tissue is found to be consistent with the formation of a
   temporary cavity associated with the observed explosion of the head, and
   subsequent quantitative examination of this phenomenon reveals two
   delayed forces at play in the backward motion of the President following
   impact. It is therefore found that the observed motions of President
   Kennedy in the film are physically consistent with a high-speed
   projectile impact from the rear of the motorcade, these resulting from
   an instantaneous forward impulse force, followed by delayed rearward
   recoil and neuromuscular forces.},

Abstract = {This article examines the recent trial of ANC president Jacob Zuma, and
   how gender power was framed in respect to, and within, the politics of
   culture. The trial centred on allegations of rape by Zuma of an HIV
   positive woman many years his junior, who was also the daughter of a
   former anti-apartheid struggle comrade. All of these details were
   considered pertinent, not only to the legal debates about whether a
   crime had been committed, but also to the political debates raging
   around the nation's key challenges of high rates of sexual violence and
   the `denialist' state response to devastating levels of HIV infection.
   Many Zuma supporters saw the accusation of rape as politically motivated
   and as evidence of an anti-Zuma conspiracy. In visibly smaller numbers,
   women's rights groups were present on the streets as well, trying to
   draw attention to the general problem of the nation's extraordinarily
   high rates of sexual violence and the general failure of the justice
   system to address cases of rape. The article argues that the fervour
   surrounding this trial, the burning political question of women's status
   was continually cast as a private matter: debates about relations
   between men and women came to be focused on issues of propriety,
   behaviour and etiquette rather than on questions about rights and power.
   In short, the privatisation of gender was effected through the politics
   of culture. As culture is politicised as a legal and secular `right',
   gender is de-politicised to become a normatively `private' and
   `customary' domain. This is not merely a South African dilemma, but a
   dilemma which is con-concomitant to the social conditions of modernity
   itself.},

Title = {Participant observation as a method of social sciences research and
   undercover police operations - conceptual differences and apparent
   similarities between criminology and criminal investigation},

Abstract = {The paper provides a review of literature on participant observation in
   social sciences and undercover police operations in Slovenia, presenting
   similarities and differences between the method of participant
   observation in criminological research and the method of undercover
   police operations in the investigation of crime. Although observation is
   common to both methods, their aims are completely different. In
   criminological research, participant observation is a method which is
   popular on the one hand but unpopular on the other and, at the same
   time, a method in which a researcher can be well- or ill-informed. It
   follows from this that such researchers can be called hostile spies,
   antipathetic members, friendly allies or friendly beginners or
   adherents. The aim of participant observation is not to detect criminal
   offenders but to study certain specifics, what can have wider
   implications than undercover police operations, which is exactly defined
   by law whereby it is stipulated that data must be protected and used
   exclusively for criminal investigation purposes. It is important to
   stress that a researcher, using the method of participant observation,
   must have a supervisor in order to preserve relative objectivity.
   Critics of participant observation consider this method to be
   `psychological spying' and think that it can arouse feelings of
   dissatisfaction and mistrust and lead to the theory of conspiracy and
   abuse for political purposes. In undercover police operations it is
   important - if the case does not get an epilogue, i.e. if the police do
   not collect enough evidence against a suspect - to protect data
   carefully, not to violate human dignity and to respect all legal
   provisions regulating this field of activity.},

Abstract = {A large survey of two-component, spherically symmetric, collisionless,
   self-consistent models is carried out with the aim of studying
   elliptical galaxies embedded in massive dark halos. Although many
   factors and options are explored in quantitative detail, the main focus
   is on a family of models where the luminous component is mostly
   isotropic inside the half-light radius and the dark component is
   slightly warmer (and normally more diffuse) than the luminous component,
   consistent with the picture that ellipticals were generically formed as
   a result of collisionless collapse (or merging) in the presence of
   cold/warm dark matter. The constraints imposed by self-consistency are
   found to be quite complex, but a few important features (such as limits
   on the amount of dark matter inside the half-light radius in terms of
   observed quantities and a characterization of the physical parameter
   space) are clarified by a proper use of the Jeans equations and of the
   virial theorem. In spite of the variety of kinematical profiles realized
   in our self-consistent models, we note a natural ``conspiracy{''} to
   support realistic photometries, that is, luminosity profiles consistent
   with the R1/4 law. Within our main family of models, we develop the
   concept of ``minimum-halo models{''} as a way to fit a given set of data
   by minimizing the request of dark matter. This paper, where many of the
   results are illustrated in terms of projected quantities for a direct
   application to observed objects, forms the theoretical basis for a
   systematic study of photometric and kinematical properties of elliptical
   galaxies that may give quantitative estimates on the amount of dark
   matter present in these systems.},

Abstract = {News creation and consumption has been changing since the advent of
   social media. An estimated 2.95 billion people in 2019 used social media
   worldwide. The widespread of the Coronavirus COVID-19 resulted with a
   tsunami of social media. Most platforms were used to transmit relevant
   news, guidelines and precautions to people. According to WHO,
   uncontrolled conspiracy theories and propaganda are spreading faster
   than the COVID-19 pandemic itself, creating an infodemic and thus
   causing psychological panic, misleading medical advises, and economic
   disruption. Accordingly, discussions have been initiated with the
   objective of moderating all COVID-19's communications, except those
   initiated from trusted sources such as the WHO and authorized
   governmental entities. This article presents a large-scale study based
   on data mined from Twitter. Extensive analysis has been performed on
   approximately one million COVID-19 related tweets collected over a
   period of two months. Furthermore, the profiles of 288,000 users were
   analyzed including unique users' profiles, meta-data and tweets'
   context. The study noted various interesting conclusions including the
   critical impact in term of reach level of the (1) exploitation of the
   COVID-19 crisis to redirect readers to irrelevant topics and (2)
   widespread of unauthentic medical precautions and information. Further
   data analysis revealed the importance of using social networks in a
   global pandemic crisis by relying on credible users with variety of
   occupations, content developers and influencers in specific fields. In
   this context, several insights and findings have been provided while
   elaborating computing and non-computing implications and research
   directions for potential solutions and social networks management
   strategies during crisis periods.},

Abstract = {Why was the French Communist Party (PCF) evicted in May 1947, only two
   years after it was asked to join the Socialists (SFIO) and the Christian
   Democrats (MRP) in a tripartite government? According to Pierre Grosser,
   the chief cause of the eviction was the pressure exerted by the United
   States on MRP and SFIO leaders, who distanced themselves from their
   Communist counterparts. While rejecting the thesis of an American-led
   conspiracy, Irwin Wall also underlines the role of MRP and SFIO
   politicians, whom he believed nourished strong anti-Communist feelings.
   The assumption is therefore that of a passive role for the PCF, the
   aspirations of which were limited to the seizure of power through
   democratic means. In contrast, this article argues that the Communists
   had a strategic interest in their own expulsion. Given what they
   perceived as a French alignment with the Western bloc at the Moscow
   Conference in April 1947, they began to weigh the advantages of a
   temporary eviction from government. They concluded that this would allow
   them to regain the support of the discontented working class and force
   the MRP and the SFIO to finally concede some of their demands. The hope
   was to stage their retour en force to the government at a later point.
   Their abstention in a vote on military appropriations for Indochina on
   19 March 1947 brought them close to expulsion. However, it was not until
   their defiance of government wage policy that Paul Ramadier finally
   evicted them on 5 May 1947. In retrospect, contrary to the PCF's
   original plan, its `temporary' return to the opposition was to last more
   than 30 years.},

Abstract = {Reputation is a crucial factor that governs the importance of a software
   agent in the agent-mediated e-market. In the e-market, various buyers
   and service providers are involved in buying and selling the products. A
   buyer agent (BA) acts on behalf of a buyer to buy the products from a
   service provider agent (SPA) preferably having a good reputation score
   (Rep-Score). The conventional customer rating mechanism for online
   transactions lacks adequate analysis and investigation of customer
   reviews and hence does not reflect the accurate reputation of the
   service providers. This research investigates the reputation of a
   software agent using customer feedback based on product attributes such
   as product quality, design, price, delivery time, and defects. A
   knowledge rule-set is formed to establish a link between customer
   feedback and the repute of a software agent. Further, a simulation-based
   approach using the Rosetta toolkit and the Fuzzy Control System is
   applied to quantify and fine-tune the reputation of a software agent.
   There could be a chance of an unfair relationship between the same
   buyer-seller pair due to recurrent transactions. The proposed work
   eliminates any chance of a conspiracy between a service provider and a
   buyer agent. In case, the buyer agent makes repeated transactions with a
   particular service provider agent, the value of the weight assigned to
   the reputation of the service provider agent is significantly diminished
   for each new transaction, hence decreasing the final value of the
   Rep-Score. As a result, this method guarantees the correctness of the
   reputation evaluation of a software agent. A performance analysis is
   performed to validate the proposed approach using mean squared error and
   standard deviation.},

Title = {HYDROSTATIC GAS CONSTRAINTS ON SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE MASSES:
   IMPLICATIONS FOR HYDROSTATIC EQUILIBRIUM AND DYNAMICAL MODELING IN A

Abstract = {We present new mass measurements for the supermassive black holes
   (SMBHs) in the centers of three early-type galaxies. The gas pressure in
   the surrounding, hot interstellar medium (ISM) is measured through
   spatially resolved spectroscopy with the Chandra X-ray Observatory,
   allowing the SMBH mass (M-BH) to be inferred directly under the
   hydrostatic approximation. This technique does not require calibration
   against other SMBH measurement methods and its accuracy depends only on
   the ISM being close to hydrostatic, which is supported by the smooth
   X-ray isophotes of the galaxies. Combined with results from our recent
   study of the elliptical galaxy NGC4649, this brings the number of
   galaxies with SMBHs measured in this way to four. Of these, three
   already have mass determinations from the kinematics of either the stars
   or a central gas disk, and hence join only a handful of galaxies with
   MBH measured by more than one technique. We find good agreement between
   the different methods, providing support for the assumptions implicit in
   both the hydrostatic and the dynamical models. The stellar mass-to-light
   ratios for each galaxy inferred by our technique are in agreement with
   the predictions of stellar population synthesis models assuming a Kroupa
   initial mass function (IMF). This concurrence implies that no more than
   similar to 10\%-20\% of the ISM pressure is nonthermal, unless there is
   a conspiracy between the shape of the IMF and nonthermal pressure.
   Finally, we compute Bondi accretion rates (M-bondi), finding that the
   two galaxies with the highest M-bondi exhibit little evidence of X-ray
   cavities, suggesting that the correlation with the active galactic
   nuclei jet power takes time to be established.},

Abstract = {Background: The demographic determinants of hesitancy in Coronavirus
   Disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccination include rurality, particularly in
   low- and middle-income countries. In the second year of the pandemic, in
   South Tyrol, Italy, 15.6 percent of a representative adult sample
   reported hesitancy. Individual factors responsible for greater
   vaccination hesitancy in rural areas of central Europe are poorly
   understood. Methods: A cross-sectional survey on a probability-based
   sample of South Tyrol residents in March 2021 was analyzed. The
   questionnaire collected information on sociodemographic characteristics,
   comorbidities, COVID-19-related experiences, conspiracy thinking, and
   the likelihood of accepting the national vaccination plan. A logistic
   regression analysis was performed. Results: Among 1426 survey
   participants, 17.6\% of the rural sample (n = 145/824) reported
   hesitancy with COVID-19 vaccination versus 12.8\% (n = 77/602) in urban
   residents (p = 0.013). Rural residents were less likely to have
   post-secondary education, lived more frequently in households with
   children under six years of age, and their economic situation was worse
   than before the pandemic. Chronic diseases and deaths due to COVID-19
   among close relatives were less frequently reported, and trust in
   pandemic management by national public health institutions was lower, as
   was trust in local authorities, civil protection, and local health
   services. Logistic regression models confirmed the most well-known
   predictors of hesitancy in both urban and rural populations; overall,
   residency was not an independent predictor. Conclusion: Several
   predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were more prevalent in rural
   areas than in urban areas, which may explain the lower vaccine uptake in
   rural areas. Rurality is not a determinant of vaccine hesitancy in the
   economically well-developed North of Italy.},

Title = {Linguistic and communication exclusion in COVID-19 awareness campaigns
   in Malawi},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFRICAN MEDIA STUDIES},

Abstract = {The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has unravelled the significance
   of having robust communication structures about health and disease to
   dynamic societies. The need to construct a mutual understanding of
   health issues has become imperative, and achieving a universal
   understanding of the disease burden requires robust information-sharing
   processes which can easily surmount the barriers to communication. What
   is challenging, however, is to communicate in a way and in a language
   that the majority of the population understands. In Malawi, where the
   majority of the population (84 per cent) live in rural areas, and
   without access to information technologies, it becomes more challenging
   when devising messages that should reach such hard-to-reach populations.
   This therefore begs the question: how effective is the COVID-19
   communication to the Malawi public domain? This article attempts to
   answer this question by discussing the language choice vis-a-vis the
   lingua-cultural needs of the masses in COVID-19 awareness, and the
   strategies and modes of communication in COVID-19 communication. In view
   of this, the article argues that the government communication strategies
   concerning COVID-19 were not entirely effective. The article notes that
   the use of English in most of the COVID-19 messages has excluded the
   majority and has perpetuated the attitude of perceiving COVID-19 as a
   disease for the rich people. The modes being used in communicating
   COVID-19 do not effectively reach the masses since the media penetration
   is minimal resulting in most Malawians getting secondhand information
   and developing myths and conspiracy theories. The article concludes that
   it is imperative for Malawi to devise a contextually appropriate
   framework for communicating complex health messages.},

Title = {Poison and romance: Oscar Wilde and the strange case of Edith Thompson},
Journal = {IRISH STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {353-365},
Abstract = {Oscar Wilde considered crime and sin no impediment to art or culture, as
   the case of the poisoner-artist-critic Thomas Wainewright (1794-1847)
   allowed him to demonstrate. English society of the time, as George
   Orwell famously declared, was as fascinated by poisoning as was Wilde.
   One of Orwell's cases was that of Edith Thompson who, along with her
   young lover, was convicted in 1922 in London of conspiracy to murder her
   husband whom it was alleged she had tried to poison. She and her lover
   were hanged in early 1923. Thompson's preoccupation with poison was
   entangled with her preoccupation with popular romance fiction of the day
   which she read copiously and discussed perceptively with her lover in
   the letters that helped to convict her. Her favourite novelist was
   Robert Hichens, the acquaintance, imitator and caricaturist of Wilde.
   She quoted Hichens's novel Bella Donna (1909) in letters to her lover,
   including on the practical matter of poison, which helped convince the
   jury of her guilt. Her trial, like Wilde's trials - all involving sexual
   transgression - raised the difficult question of whether literature
   could poison and influence for the worse its readers or whether it lay
   outside both morality and the world of action. Moreover, were Thompson's
   own letters literature and fantasy or were they oblique discussions of
   practical intent, including the intent to murder? As in the case of
   Wilde, a larger question supervened. In part through her reading, in
   part through her own experience, Edith came to believe, even before the
   murder, that freedom is an illusion, fate an inescapable reality.},

Title = {Hong Kong undercover: an approach to `collaborative colonialism'},

Note = {Workshop on Urban Imaginaries, Lingnan Univ, Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA,

Abstract = {Early Hong Kong colonial history offers a distinct angle for
   understanding the exceptional circumstances in which a place was
   colonized by both the British and their Chinese collaborators. The term
   `collaborative colonialism' characterizes a political-cultural formation
   where descriptions of flows and trajectories of forces may be more
   helpful than history in illuminating the colony's murky pasts. Full of
   treacheries, conspiracies, betrayals and mistrust, such pasts can also
   help to explain the popularity of `undercover' figures in Hong Kong's
   movies. At risk of losing his true identity, the undercover figure was
   received as a social victim in the early 1980s' `new wave' that followed
   the legacy of social realism. To feed the appetite for gang heroism,
   this `victim' soon transformed into a tragic hero agonized by moral
   anxieties. Yet the frame imposed by the police-gangster genre did not
   stop it from being used as a vehicle to reflect on Hong Kong's
   geo-political situation: a place located in-between different political
   projects beyond the locals' control, and gripped by the relentless march
   of policed-managerial modern order. A twist in the 1990s gave the
   undercover figure a cynicist and comedic turn. Postmodern celebrations
   of witty betrayal can be read as rewriting the undercover story to
   reinscribe Hong Kong's fate: released from narcissistic heroism, new
   undercover images responding to the 1997 transition took identity less
   as a matter of authenticity than of performance. Unravelling this
   historically-embedded structure of feelings shows how the way had long
   been paved for the success of the award-winning series Infernal Affairs,
   extending a deeper reach into the local politics of memory and time.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim is to discover the perceptions of individuals living
   in different countries relating to Covid-19 and develop a joint
   initiative against this virus and future outbreaks by making comparisons
   over a number of sociological factors.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional research design was applied,
   which is a type of descriptive survey belonging to quantitative
   research. The sample was selected from various countries: Turkey, USA,
   France, Germany, Netherlands, Georgia, India, and South Africa. The
   total number of participants is 1020 people. The data were provided
   through the One-Way Anova Test and collected based on ``The Covid-19
   Perception Questionnaire{''} which contained 5 personal information and
   10 items.
   Results: We found that statistically significant differences among the
   Covid-19 perceptions of individuals. The effect size showed that this
   difference is at a large level. As the variances did not evenly
   distribute, the Dunnett C multiple comparison tests were applied.
   According to this, the highest mean in Georgia and India, the lowest
   mean in Germany and the USA.
   Conclusion: The majority have the national and international awareness
   required to cope with the pandemic. However, the source of the virus has
   still not been explained so it has been observed that the number of
   people who believe in conspiracy theories is also high. As a result,
   people need more reliable sources of information, especially the World
   Health Organization should make more precise explanations to people
   about the origin of Covid-19 and updated information should be made
   available to people constantly. In addition, although a long time passed
   after the appearance of the Covid-19, people are still confused.},

Abstract = {Purpose The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of
   ethical dilemmas in the end-of-life process in advanced cancer patients.
   Methods We carried out a multicenter, cross-sectional, observational,
   prospective study in a cohort of cancer patients whose life expectancy
   was <= 6 months. We recorded sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis
   of cancer, symptom burden, cognitive and functional status, emotional
   impact, and sociofamilial risk factors. The main outcome measure was the
   detection of ethical dilemmas, based on the following definition:
   conflict in decision-making during the end-of-life process that involves
   the need to choose between morally acceptable opposing options, where
   none is clearly preferable to another. Results We included 324 patients
   (mean age, 69 years; 58\% men). We identified 117 dilemmas in 90
   patients (27.8\%). The dilemmas detected were as follows: (a) conflicts
   of information (adaptive denial, conspiracy of silence, information
   exceeding patient's desired limit), 15.7\%; (b) discrepancies in
   proportionality (discussion on futility, rejection of treatment,
   withdrawal of life support measures), 16.7\%; (c) unrealistic
   expectations about the outcome of clinical trials, 2.5\%; and (d)
   request for euthanasia or medically assisted suicide, 1.2\%. We observed
   a greater prevalence of ethical dilemmas in men, in patients receiving
   active cancer treatment, and in patients with emotional distress (p <
   0.05). Conclusions The prevalence of ethical dilemmas during the
   end-of-life process in cancer patients is relevant. Most dilemmas were
   associated directly or indirectly with respect for patient autonomy. In
   this context, the communication skills of the health professionals and
   advanced care planning take on a key role.},

Abstract = {In this article the mystical historiosophy of Velimir Khlebnikov is
   considered as a form of Russian historiosophical thought. Religious,
   philosophical, historical and cultural prerequisites of formation of the
   concept of historicism in Russian mysticism of the beginning of the 20th
   century are analyzed. Special attention is paid to ``Boards of Fate{''},
   a collection of notes and observations about the universal laws of time
   discovered by Khlebnikov. In the article general principles are
   formulated of assessment of both the mystical historiosophy of
   Khlebnikov, and other attempts of mystic-occult development of the
   principle of historicism. Progress in the humanities and cultural
   anthropology makes it easy to see the limitation of such attempts and to
   establish some of their initial attitudes, reproduced by default. When
   these attitudes remain ignored, mystical historicism not only is
   reproduced in this or that form again and again, but also naturally
   finds admirers. In particular, we consider the idea of ``the universal
   myth{''} which for a long time was an attractive reference point for
   anthropology and for other humanities. Modern anthropological theories
   (for example, M. Godelye), see in such construction of the universal
   myth the reproduction of old speculative idealism in new forms of
   ethnology and psychoanalysis. As the current state of domestic culture
   is characterized by deviations from scientific and philosophical
   historicism (various versions of folk history, ``new chronology{''} of
   A. Fomenko, conspiracy theories, etc.), analysis of sources of Russian
   mystical historicism acquires natural relevance. A conclusion is made
   about the need to study Russian historiosophical mysticism for deeper
   understanding of the principle of historicism and of peculiarities of
   its perception in Russia.},

Title = {Spectral Sirens: Cosmology from the Full Mass Distribution of Compact
   Binaries},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS},

Abstract = {We explore the use of the mass spectrum of neutron stars and black holes
   in gravitational-wave compact binary sources as a cosmological probe.
   These standard siren sources provide direct measurements of luminosity
   distance. In addition, features in the mass distribution, such as mass
   gaps or peaks, will redshift and thus provide independent constraints on
   their redshift distribution. We argue that the entire mass spectrum
   should be utilized to provide cosmological constraints. For example, we
   find that the mass spectrum of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events introduces at
   least five independent mass ``features{''}: the upper and lower edges of
   the pair instability supernova (PISN) gap, the upper and lower edges of
   the neutron star-black hole gap, and the minimum neutron star mass. We
   find that although the PISN gap dominates the cosmological inference
   with current detectors (second generation, 2G), as shown in previous
   work, it is the lower mass gap that will provide the most powerful
   constraints in the era of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope (third
   generation, 3G). By using the full mass distribution, we demonstrate
   that degeneracies between mass evolution and cosmological evolution can
   be broken, unless an astrophysical conspiracy shifts all features of the
   full mass distribution simultaneously following the (nontrivial) Hubble
   diagram evolution. We find that this self-calibrating ``spectral
   siren{''} method has the potential to provide precision constraints of
   both cosmology and the evolution of the mass distribution, with 2G
   achieving better than 10\% precision on H(z) at z less than or similar
   to 1 within a year and 3G reaching less than or similar to 1\% at z
   greater than or similar to 2 within one month.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article was to take into account the large number of
   publications on the PBL and its application at different levels, to make
   a critical assessment of this and the causes that prevent its
   application at different educational levels. A review of the term
   ``Problem Based Learning{''} in the title of the documents was done in
   Google Scholar. 1000 references were obtained for the period 2000-2016.
   Of this total 536 (53.6\%) documents have been cited 1 time or more.
   Using the same criterion of citations received, a total of 84 references
   were finally determined, all with 10 citations or more. Their analysis
   sought to clarify the fundamental trends in PBL and its application.
   According to the study, it was possible to characterize the possible
   cycle of application of the PBL and the changes that implies in the role
   of teacher and student. The central aspect in this is the design of the
   problem, that is to say, to concretize a real problem and the
   feasibility of studying it. Against the application of the PBL
   conspiracy: the current form of organization of the curriculum based
   more on transmission of knowledge, Which are based more on measuring
   knowledge than reasoning skills and reflection and active participation
   and the same student / teacher relationship. As desirable research lines
   that derive from the study carried out is the need for studies that
   analyze specific cases and that rather than focusing on the theoretical
   aspects provide concrete examples of success or failure in the
   application of problems and serve as an example for the same Teacher
   training for a PBL implementation},

Abstract = {The possibility of measuring the density parameter OMEGA-0 and the
   cosmological constant lambda-0 = LAMBDA/(3H0(2)) using dynamical tests
   is explored in linear and non-linear theory. In linear theory we find
   that the rate of growth of the perturbations at the present epoch is
   approximated by f(z = 0) almost-equal-to-OMEGA-0(0.6) + 1/70 lambda-0(1
   + 1/2 OMEGA-0). Therefore, dynamical tests such as infall around
   clusters and dipoles at the present epoch do not distinguish well
   between universes with and without a cosmological constant. At higher
   redshifts, the perturbations also depend mainly on the matter density at
   a particular epoch, f(z) almost-equal-to OMEGA-0.6(z), which has a
   strong dependence on lambda-0 at z almost-equal-to 0.5-2.0. Therefore,
   information on both parameters can be obtained by looking at clustering
   at different redshifts. In practice, however, the other observables also
   depend on the cosmology, and in some cases conspire to give a weak
   dependence on lambda-0. By using the non-linear spherical infall model
   for a family of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) power-spectra we also find that
   dynamics at z = 0 does not tell much about lambda-0. At higher redshifts
   there is unfortunately another conspiracy between conventional
   observables, which hides information about lambda-0. The final radius of
   a virialized cluster (relative to the turnaround radius) is approximated
   by R(f)/R(ta) almost-equal-to (1 - eta/2)/(2 - eta/2), where eta is the
   ratio of LAMBDA to the density at turn-around. Therefore a
   repulsive-LAMBDA gives a smaller final radius than a vanishing-LAMBDA.},

Abstract = {Background/Aim The first case of COVID-19 in Turkey was officially
   recorded on March 11, 2020. Social media use increased worldwide, as
   well as in Turkey, during the pandemic, and conspiracy theories/fake
   news about medical complications of vaccines spread throughout the
   world. The aim of this study was to identify community interactions
   related to vaccines and to identify key influences/influencers before
   and after the pandemic using social network data from Twitter. Materials
   and methods Two datasets, including tweets about vaccinations before and
   after COVID-19 in Turkey, were collected. Social networks were created
   based on interactions (mentions) between Twitter users. Users and their
   influence were scored based on social network analysis and parameters
   that included in-degree and betweenness centrality. Results In the
   pre-COVID-19 network, media figures and authors who had anti-vaccine
   views were the most influential users. In the post-COVID-19 network, the
   Turkish minister of health, the was the most influential figure. The
   vaccine network was observed to be growing rapidly after COVID-19, and
   the physicians and authors who had opinions about mandatory vaccinations
   received a great deal of reaction. One-way communication between
   influencers and other users in the network was determined. Conclusions
   This study shows the effectiveness and usefulness of large social media
   data for understanding public opinion on public health and vaccination
   in Turkey. The current study was completed before the implementation of
   the COVID-19 vaccine in Turkey. We anticipated that social network
   analysis would help reduce the ``infodemic{''} before administering the
   vaccine and would also help public health workers act more proactively
   in this regard.},

Title = {The anti-vaccination infodemic on social media: A behavioral analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Vaccinations are without doubt one of the greatest achievements of
   modern medicine, and there is hope that they can constitute a solution
   to halt the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the anti-vaccination
   movement is currently on the rise, spreading online misinformation about
   vaccine safety and causing a worrying reduction in vaccination rates
   worldwide. In this historical time, it is imperative to understand the
   reasons of vaccine hesitancy, and to find effective strategies to
   dismantle the rhetoric of anti-vaccination supporters. For this reason,
   we analyzed the behavior of anti-vaccination supporters on the platform
   Twitter. Here we identify that anti-vaccination supporters, in
   comparison with pro-vaccination supporters, share conspiracy theories
   and make use of emotional language. We demonstrate that anti-vaccination
   supporters are more engaged in discussions on Twitter and share their
   contents from a pull of strong influencers. We show that the movement's
   success relies on a strong sense of community, based on the contents
   produced by a small fraction of profiles, with the community at large
   serving as a sounding board for anti-vaccination discourse to circulate
   online. Our data demonstrate that Donald Trump, before his profile was
   suspended, was the main driver of vaccine misinformation on Twitter.
   Based on these results, we welcome policies that aim at halting the
   circulation of false information about vaccines by targeting the
   anti-vaccination community on Twitter. Based on our data, we also
   propose solutions to improve the communication strategy of health
   organizations and build a community of engaged influencers that support
   the dissemination of scientific insights, including issues related to
   vaccines and their safety.},

Title = {Power-law Sersic profiles in hydrostatic stellar galaxy discs},

Abstract = {Previously, we showed that surface density profiles of the form of a
   power-law times a Sersic function satisfy the hydrostatic Jeans
   equations, a variety of observational constraints, and the condition of
   a minimal radial entropy profile in two-dimensional galaxy discs with
   fixed power law, halo potentials. It was assumed that such density
   profiles are generated by star scattering by clumps, waves, or other
   inhomogeneities. Here, we generalize these models to self-gravitating
   discs. The cylindrically symmetric Poisson equation imposes strong
   constraints. Scattering processes favour smoothness, so the smoothest
   solutions, which minimize entropy gradients, are preferred. In the case
   of self-gravitating discs (e.g. inner discs), the gravity, surface
   density, and radial velocity dispersion in these smoothest models are
   all of the form 1/r times an exponential. When vertical balance is
   included, the vertical velocity dispersion squared has the same form as
   the surface density, and the scale height is constant. In combined
   self-gravitating plus halo gravity cases, the radial dispersion has an
   additional power-law term. None the less, the surface density profile
   has the same form at all radii, without breaks, satisfying the
   `disc-halo conspiracy'. The azimuthal velocity and velocity dispersions
   are smooth, though the former can have a distinct peak. In these models
   the vertical dispersion increases inwards, and scattering may mediate a
   transition to a secular bulge. If halo gravity dominates vertically in
   the outer disc, it flares. The models suggest a correlation between disc
   mass and radial scale length. The combination of smoothness, simplicity,
   ability to match generic observational features, and physical
   constraints is unique to these models.},

Title = {A rare mythological scene at Gornji Grad: the tale of Scylla and Minos?},
Journal = {ARHEOLOSKI VESTNIK},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {179-198},
Abstract = {The article discusses a central motif on the socle of a funerary
   monument at Gornji Grad, Slovenia. Together with those from Oswaldgraben
   (western Styria, province of Noricum) and Aquincum, it has been
   interpreted ever since the fundamental study written on the subject by
   Erna Diez as showing the reunion of Menelaus and Helen after the end of
   the Trojan War. This interpretation, however, becomes less certain upon
   comparing the relief to a less well-known mirror from the Bulla Regia
   cemetery (province of Africa proconsularis). The latter shows an almost
   identical composition, but includes the figure of an elderly woman who
   does not appear in the reunion story. The main features of the scene,
   the hand on the hilt of the sword, the woman offering an object to the
   man, and the active role of Eros, can be found in another, rarely
   depicted myth, namely the meeting of Minos and Scylla, described in most
   detail in the Ciris epyllion. According to the latter, Scylla, the
   daughter of King Nisus, falls in love with the enemy King Minos after an
   intervention by Eros, and is aided, in conspiracy against her father and
   homeland, by her nurse.
   Iconographical analysis and literary sources have enabled the author to
   add four new depictions of Minos and Scylla to those already known.
   Three of those newly-added are depictions on stone reliefs, from Noricum
   (Gornji Grad, Oswaldgraben) and Pannonia (Aquincum), with the fourth one
   on the above-mentioned bronze mirror. All of them had previously been
   interpreted as the reunion of Menelaus and Helen after the end of the
   Trojan War.},

Title = {A cartographic view on mood prominence and force in Mandarin A case of
   the speaker-oriented adverb <i>zuihao</i>},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-48},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {This work investigates the division of labor between mood and
   illocutionary force in syntax by examining three modal construals
   encoded by the speaker-oriented adverb zuihao `best' (deontic, epistemic
   and evidential) in Mandarin, and accounts for a cluster of syntactic and
   pragmatic properties it is associated with. Very much in line with
   Tsai's (2015a, 2015b and 2015d) modal system in Mandarin, it is observed
   that each type of zuihao can cooccur with its matching modal auxiliary
   in the fashion of Cinque's (1999) location-in-Spec' hypothesis and
   encodes a certain type of illocutionary force. One persistent question
   is how zuihao substantiates illocutionary force in syntax, while its
   designated position is not situated in the licensing domain of ForceP.
   As far as the left periphery is concerned, this work argues for a
   conspiracy between syntax, semantics and pragmatics to ensure the
   success in activating the Bidirectional Agree relation between speech
   act, force and mood. We argue for a speech act layer (Sa{*}P) externally
   merging to CP (Speas and Tenny, 2003), whose head values the
   uninterpretable speech act feature {[}uSa] on Force degrees via the
   Bidirectional Agree to trigger its interface with the utterance content
   (CP). Meanwhile, following Kempchinsky's (2009) idea, it is further
   argued in this work that Force degrees hosts the uninterpretable feature
   {[}uW] which has to be checked and valued by the modal construals of
   zuihao to determine the irrealis-realis mood. An immediate implication
   is that ForceP serves as a gateway to not only mood but also speech act
   at the interface. Several issues involved in dealing with zuihao are
   discussed.},

Title = {Secure Data De-Duplication Based on Threshold Blind Signature and Bloom
   Filter in Internet of Things},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Within the cloud environment, the availability of storage, as well as
   bandwidth, can be effectively preserved in virtue of data
   de-duplication. However, refraining redundancy from additional storage
   or communication is not trivial due to security concerns. Though
   intensive researches have been addressed on a convergent cryptosystem
   for secure data de-duplication, the conflicts amongst functionality,
   confidentiality, and authority remain unbalanced. More concretely,
   although data are obfuscated under convergent encryption, a violent
   dictionary attack is still efficacious since the whole pseudorandom
   process relies heavily on plaintexts. As for data ownership, the
   download privilege, which depends on hash value, may also be infringed
   due to the same reason. To dispose of these problems, we presented a
   conspiracy-free data de-duplication protocol based on a threshold blind
   signature in this article. With the help of multiple key servers, the
   outsourced file and de-duplication label will be computationally
   indistinguishable from random strings. We used the Boom filter as a tool
   to implement a proof of ownership, ensuring that the ownership claims
   made by users are real. It effectively prevents the attacker from using
   the stolen tag to get the whole file to gain file access without
   authorization. The most significant innovation of this article is to use
   homomorphism computation to aggregate and generate partial signature
   tags, and to introduce a secret sharing mechanism based on The Chinese
   Remainder Theorem to hide signature keys, thus balancing the security
   concerns of cloud and client. Compared with existing schemes, both
   communication and computation performances are preferable in our
   protocol. As far as we know, our scheme is the only data de-duplication
   scheme that satisfies the semantic security of ciphertext and label.},

Abstract = {The discovery of protoglobular cluster candidates in many present-day
   mergers allows us to understand better the possible effects of a merger
   event on the globular cluster system of a galaxy, and to foresee the
   properties of the end-product. By comparing these expectations with the
   properties of globular cluster systems of elliptical galaxies at the
   present time we can constrain merger models. The observational data
   indicate that (i) every gaseous merger induces the formation of new star
   clusters, and (ii) the number of new clusters formed in such a merger
   increases with the gas content of the progenitor galaxies.
   Low-luminosity (about My > -21), discy ellipticals are generally thought
   to be the result of a gaseous merger. As such, new globular clusters are
   expected to form but have not been detected to date. We investigate
   various reasons for the non-detection of subpopulations in
   low-luminosity ellipticals, i.e. absence of an old population, absence
   of a new population, destruction of one of the populations and, finally,
   an age-metallicity conspiracy that allows old and new globular clusters
   to appear indistinguishable at the present epoch. All of these
   possibilities lead us to a similar conclusion, namely that
   low-luminosity ellipticals did not form recently (z < 1) in a gas-rich
   merger, and might not have formed in a major merger of stellar systems
   at all. High-luminosity ellipticals do reveal globular cluster
   subpopulations. However, it is difficult to account for the two
   populations in terms of mergers alone and, in particular, we can rule
   out scenarios in which the second subpopulation is the product of a
   recent, gas-poor merger.},

Title = {Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes in
   France},

Abstract = {Objectives: The objective of the study is to investigate the factors
   associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes in France.
   Study design: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among a
   representative sample of the French population between November 20th and
   23rd 2020 (N = 1146).
   Methods: Factors associated with the intention to get vaccinated and
   with COVID-19 vaccine attitudes were estimated using ordered logistic
   and multinomial logistic regressions, respectively. Independent
   variables of interest include COVID-19 and vaccine perceptions, trust,
   endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and time/risk preferences.
   Results: Only 30.5\% of our respondents would agree to get vaccinated
   against COVID-19 during the first semester of 2021 while 31.1\% declare
   being unsure of their vaccination intentions. COVID-19 risk perceptions
   are associated with vaccination intentions and attitudes. Individual and
   collective benefits of the vaccine and the concerns over its safety are
   strongly associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes.
   Vaccine acceptors are more willing to take risks in the health domain
   compared with vaccine hesitant respondents which indicates that the
   COVID-19 vaccine is perceived as a greater health risk than the COVID-19
   itself by some respondents. We also find a positive association between
   future preference and the willingness to get vaccinated.
   Conclusion: Awareness campaigns should be conducted to enhance
   vaccination uptake among vaccine hesitant individuals. These campaigns
   could highlight the positive benefit-risk balance of the COVID-19
   vaccines or the short-term benefits of vaccination and should reinsure
   the public on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. (C) 2021 The Royal

Abstract = {Objective: A better understanding of public attitudes towards
   vaccination and recognition of associated factors with vaccine hesitancy
   or refusal is important regarding the control of the pandemic. Our aim
   was to analyze the public's attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and to
   identify factors affecting them.
   Materials and Methods: Data were drawn from the Turkish COVID-19
   Snapshot Monitoring, between July-December 2020, a serial online
   cross-sectional survey. The sample comprised 3888 adult respondents.
   Attitudes to vaccines and trust were investigated in 3 periods
   corresponding to the timeline of pandemic-related events in Turkey.
   Results: In the third period of our study, in parallel with the increase
   in the spread of COVID-19, vaccine hesitancy/refusal increased
   significantly from 43.9\% to 58.9\% (P < .001). The significant
   predictors of vaccine refusal were female gender, being elder, and
   conspiracy thinking. Having a chronic illness, worrying more about loved
   ones and the health system being overloaded were significant predictors
   of vaccine willingness. Less compliance with preventive measures, less
   knowledge of prevention, reduced risk perception, and higher perception
   of media hype were COVID-19 variables that correlated with vaccine
   refusal. Trust in the Ministry of Health and medical professional
   organizations (e.g., Turkish Medical Association) was the lowest in the
   third period and vaccine refusal was significantly related to the
   decreased trust (P < .001, P = .002).
   Conclusion: Most respondents (approximately 60\%) refused or hesitated
   to get a COVID-19 vaccine, though acceptability should be monitored when
   a vaccine becomes available. Health authorities should consider public
   trust, risk perception, and behavioral factors to improve COVID-19
   vaccine acceptability.},

Title = {The need for intellectual diversity in psychological science: Our own
   studies of actively open-minded thinking as a case study},
Journal = {COGNITION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {187},
Pages = {156-166},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Actively open-minded thinking (AOT) is measured by questionnaire items
   that tap the willingness to consider alternative opinions, the
   sensitivity to evidence contradictory to current beliefs, the
   willingness to postpone closure, and reflective thought. AOT has been
   found to be a strong predictor of performance on heuristics and biases
   tasks and of the avoidance of reasoning traps such as superstitious
   thinking and belief in conspiracy theories. Recently, several studies
   that have employed short forms of the AOT scale have shown startlingly
   high negative correlations with religiosity (in the range of -0.50 to
   -0.70). In a re-analysis of a large dataset, we demonstrate that it was
   a particular type of AOT item (termed a belief revision item, BR) that
   accounts for these large correlations. To our consternation, we realized
   that it was our research team that had introduced these items into the
   literature two decades ago, but we had heretofore never realized the
   potential for these items to skew correlations. In a new experiment, we
   demonstrate how BR items of this type disadvantage religious minded
   subjects, and we show that it is possible to construct BR items with
   parallel content that are not so demographically biased. We also show
   that unbiased BR items do not sacrifice the predictive power that has
   previously been shown by AOT scales. We believe this lesson in item
   construction resulted from the lack of intellectual diversity in our own
   laboratory (specifically, the overwhelmingly secular composition of our
   lab personnel). We believe this case study shows the importance of
   intellectual diversity in psychology, especially when studying such
   topics as religiosity and political attitudes.},

Abstract = {Over die last three decades the menopause has continued to interest die
   medical profession, the pharmaceutical industry and the mass media.
   Although there exist many different views on the menopause, there is one
   common denominator: Menopause is depicted as an exclusively female
   condition. The medical discourse on menopause seems to exclude men.
   However; a closer look at the history of the medical sciences reveals
   that there have been and still are, attempts to classify symptoms of
   ageing men as male menopause or climacterium. Despite these attempts to
   put men on the menopausal agenda, most attention is focused on women.
   How can we understand this almost exclusive focus on female bodies? Why
   does there exist such an emphasis on the medicalization of the third age
   of women rather than of men? Maybe we might be inc-lined to chink of a
   male conspiracy, as has been suggested by feminists: women take the
   pills, while men cash the bills. We might consider the enormous profits
   of the pharmaceutical industry. This paper is concerned with finding an
   alternative explanation for the almost exclusive attention for the
   female menopause. Based on historical data and more recent discussions
   in medical journals, the paper shows that the medicalization of the
   female menopause and the relative silence around the male climacterium
   can be understood in terms of the serial and cultural processes that
   underly the classification of health problems as specific diseases. The
   imbalance in medical treatment of climacteric health problems in women
   and men is not simply rooted in biological sex differences, but ran be
   ascribed to men's attitudes towards health problems and organizational
   infrastructures of the medical institutions.},

Abstract = {As early as in the 1930s the psychiatrist Ewen Cameron laid the
   organisational fundamentals for the reform of psychiatric hospitals,
   introduced the open-door system, and founded the worldwide first
   psychiatric day-hospital in 1946. He also developed an automated
   psychotherapy, called ``psychic driving{''}; furthermore, he bundled the
   somatic treatments of his time (scientific context) to a new form of
   treatment that he called ``depatterning{''}. His public image initially
   was determined by his charismatic personality, which received important
   honors; e.g. in 1961 he became the founding president of the World
   Psychiatric Association (WPA). Ten years after his death in 1967, when
   it became known that one of his research projects was covertly
   cofinanced by the CIA, he was stylized as the incarnation of
   brainwashing. The public concern with ``brain-washing{''} and the mind
   control techniques of the CIA embedded in the societal atmosphere of the
   ``cold war{''} with its conspiracy conjectures (societal context)
   changed fundamentally the posthumous image of Cameron. In a critical
   look back the fact remains that Cameron could have realized his research
   concepts in a clinical context that tolerated his research against the
   disease and emphasized this as opposed to the immediate suffering of the
   individual patient and, at the same time did not completely internalize
   the clear ethical regulations of the year 1948: the Nuremberg Codex, the
   World Medical Association's- Declaration of Geneva as well as the
   UN-Declaration of Human Rights. Furthermore, in his socially technical
   phantasies Cameron was in danger of leaving the socially oriented
   psychiatric care of mentally ill patients and of slipping down into a
   totalitarian ideology.},

Title = {The Global Regulation of ``Fake News{''} in the Time of Oxymora: Facts
   and Fictions about the Covid-19 Pandemic as Coincidences or Predictive
   Programming?},

Abstract = {The beginning of the twenty-first century saw an apparent change in
   language in public discourses characterised by the rise of so-called
   ``essentially oxymoronic concepts{''}, i.e., mainly oxymora and
   paradoxes. In earlier times, these rhetorical figures of speech were
   largely reserved for the domain of literature, the arts or mysticism.
   Today, however, many new technologies and other innovations are
   contributing to their rise also in the domains of science and of law.
   Particularly in law, their inherent contradictory quality of combining
   apparently antagonistic suppositions challenges the traditional
   dualistic mode of reasoning and binary logic. As reflected in terms like
   fake news, alternative facts or conspiracy theories, these concepts are
   seen as a threat to the rule of law and legal certainty and have been
   described as harbingers of an age of disinformation or post-truth. The
   challenge posed by these apparently contradictory concepts requires a
   closer look at the premises that guide our legal thinking and a more
   integrated theory of the senses and their role in law, as captured by
   the terms ``legal synaesthesia{''} and ``legal semiotics{''}. It also
   calls for an inquiry into the mind's functioning generally and how it
   processes information in the creative process of decision making,
   linking thoughts and actions as well as facts and fictions. Based on the
   qualification of ``fake news{''} as an oxymoron, this article critically
   examines the deficiencies in a dichotomous distinction between fact and
   fiction exemplified by information about the pandemic of coronavirus
   disease 2019 (Covid-19) in an attempt to clarify the principal issues
   for a global regulatory debate regarding ``fake news{''}.},

Abstract = {Study Objective: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has shown
   efficacy, however, many vaccine-eligible persons remain unvaccinated.
   YouTube is a popular video-sharing platform with several topics,
   including the HPV vaccine. Our purpose was to examine the tone of
   YouTube videos toward the HPV vaccine, accuracy of the information
   displayed, and content of commentary.
   Design: In this observational study we investigated publicly available
   content regarding the HPV vaccine on the video-sharing Web site YouTube
   (www.youtube.com). Videos and comments were collected between June 22,
   2014 and December 19, 2014. A total of 35 videos, with the 100 most
   recent comments for each video were collected and coded by a single
   researcher. A 25\% subsample were coded by a second researcher to ensure
   inter-rater agreement of greater than 80\%.
   Setting, Participants, and Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Videos were evaluated for 4 types of information:
   descriptive information, tone toward the vaccine (anti-or provaccine),
   content, and commentary content, sorted according to 11 frequently
   identified themes.
   Results: Most videos were negative in tone toward the vaccine. The tone
   of the video was not a predictor of video popularity. Pro-vaccine videos
   were 4 times more likely to report information accurately than
   anti-vaccine videos. Anti-vaccine videos were more likely to report
   information incorrectly and omit information. The most frequent
   commentary themes were concerning serious side effects, conspiracy
   theories, and vaccines generally being unhealthy.
   Conclusion: The Internet is an important resource for the general
   population; widely viewed YouTube videos contain erroneous and
   incomplete information. Anti-vaccine ideology is prevalent in video

Title = {Pandemic paranoia, general paranoia, and their relationships with worry
   and beliefs about self/others-A multi-site latent class analysis},
Journal = {SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {241},
Pages = {122-129},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in paranoid
   thinking has been reported internationally. The development of the
   Pandemic Paranoia Scale (PPS) has provided a reliable assessment of
   various facets of pandemic paranoia. This study aimed to (i) identify
   classes of individuals with varying levels of general paranoia and
   pandemic paranoia, and (ii) examine associations between classification
   and worry, core beliefs, and prohealth behaviours. Methods: An
   international sample of adults (N = 2510) across five sites completed
   the Revised-Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale and the PPS. Latent class
   analysis (LCA) was conducted using these two paranoia variables. Classes
   were compared on trait worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), beliefs
   about self/others (Brief Core Schema Scales), and pro-health behaviour.
   Results: Three latent classes emerged: Class 1 with low R-GPTS and PPS
   scores, Class 2 with a high R-GPTS score and a moderate PPS score, and
   Class 3 with high R-GPTS and PPS scores. Compared to Class 1, Classes
   2-3 were associated with more worry and negative self- and
   other-beliefs. Class 3 was further characterised by greater
   positive-self beliefs and less engagement in pro-health behaviours.
   Engagement in pro-health behaviours was positively correlated with
   interpersonal mistrust and negatively correlated with paranoid
   conspiracy and persecutory threat. Conclusions: Individuals with a
   general paranoia tendency were more likely to respond to the global
   health threats in a suspicious and distrusting way. Our findings
   suggested that worry and negative self/other beliefs may contribute to
   not just general paranoia but also pandemic paranoia. The preliminary
   finding of a link between pro-health behaviours and interpersonal
   mistrust warrants further examination.},

Title = {PLEADING AND THE DILEMMAS OF ``GENERAL RULES{''}},
Journal = {WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2009},
Number = {2},
Pages = {535-564},
Abstract = {This Paper comments on Professor Geoffrey Miller's paper on pleading
   under Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues \& Rights, Ltd. and goes on (1) to
   use Tellabs, Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, and Iqbal v. Hasty (in
   which the Supreme Court of the United States has granted review) to
   illustrate the limits of, and costs created by, certain foundational
   assumptions and operating principles that are associated with the Rules
   Enabling Act's requirement of ``general rules{''}; and (2), more
   generally, to illustrate the costs of the complex procedural system that
   we have created. Thus, for instance, the argument that the standards
   emerging from Twombly should be confined to antitrust conspiracy cases
   confronts the foundational assumptions that the Federal Rules of Civil
   Procedure are transsubstantive and that they cannot be amended by
   judicial interpretation. Similarly, in Iqbal, the government presumably
   denies that it is calling for the imposition of a heightened
   fact-pleading requirement in cases involving high government officials
   entitled to an immunity defense because the Court seems to have made it
   impossible for the judiciary openly to impose such a requirement other
   than through ``The Enabling Act Process.{''} The Court may, however,
   take a different view of the appropriate contextual plausibility
   judgment than did the lower court in Iqbal. If so, however, the Court
   would thereby confirm the view that Twombly is an invitation to the
   lower courts to make ad hoc decisions reflecting buried policy choices.
   I therefore argue that, if the Court is persuaded that the changes
   already made to pleading jurisprudence are insufficient to accommodate
   the needs of the immunity defense, it should forthrightly require fact
   pleading as a matter of substantive federal common law.},

Abstract = {The racial identity of Bengal played a significant role in shaping and
   determining the political discourse in South Asia at different periods
   of history. The most violent expression of this identity occurred during
   the 1970-71 crisis between East and West wings of Pakistan and
   culminated in the dismemberment of Pakistan and the emergence of
   separate independent state of Bangladesh with the support of India. This
   violent episode of assertion of racial identity was marked with drama,
   trauma and tragedy. The tragic memories of violence are still alive and
   affect the attitude of people and state as well. While for Bengalis the
   war of 1971 was a war of liberation and deliverance from tyrannical and
   exploitative rule of West Pakistan, for Indians the victory was a great
   national achievement and a good lesson and settling of score with
   Pakistan. For Pakistanis it was the act of betrayal from Bengalis and an
   Indian conspiracy. An attempt will be made in this study to understand
   the development of racial identity in East Bengal and its culmination in
   armed conflict of 1971. An effort will be made to understand the
   xenophobia of Bengali nationalists and the xenophobic response of
   Pakistani military. The study will trace historical and structural roots
   of this phenomenon to understand the way this xenophobia was politicized
   and to understand the dynamics of this crisis through application of
   xenophobic response of conflicting identities. Xenophobia, in East
   Pakistan, acquired the general character and was institutionalized and
   manifested itself in mass scale. This study will be an effort to
   approach this problem through historical perspective; where the humans'
   social behavior determined and guided the political conduct of a certain
   community.},

Abstract = {National veterinary services monitor endemic, emerging and exotic
   disease situations. They intervene when epidemic tendencies demand. They
   unravel complex disease situations. They do so as monopolies, in
   environments of political influence and budgetary restraint. When human,
   animal health and trade protection dictate, they design import or
   domestic disease control programs. As much as 80\% of program
   expenditures are on surveillance. Their initiatives are scrutinized by
   treasuries from which they seek funding, industries from which they seek
   collaboration and trading partners from whom they seek recognition.
   In democracies, surveillance and control programs are often the products
   of a complicated consultative process. It involves individuals who have
   both a commitment to improving an existing animal health situation and
   access to the required resources. The generations that designed
   traditionally risk-averse national surveillance and control programs
   have given way to a new one which is more epidemiologically informed.
   Their successors design programs bearing epidemiologically based
   improvements. The transition, however, has not been overwhelmingly
   welcomed.
   Expenditures on surveillance are tolerated out of fear during outbreaks
   of foreign or re-emergence of indigenous disease. Between epidemics,
   they decline at the hands of producers' unwillingness and budgetary
   restraint. Human nature responds to the high cost of surveillance in
   forms ranging from naivete through to conspiracy. While legislation
   cannot subdue such human frailty, several other opportunities exist.
   Education can remove the majority of problems caused by ignorance,
   leaving the minority that arise intentionally. Technology decreases the
   high cost of testing which tempts individuals to cut corners.
   International standards assist National Veterinary Services to overcome
   domestic resistance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The desire to eat sweet things does not need to be suppressed, just
   managed, according to health and nutrition experts meeting at the
   International Sweeteners Association's conference in Brussels on June
   19. At the event, leading scientists in the field concluded that low
   calorie sweeteners provide an effective solution to fulfilling our
   natural desire for sweet tastes, without allowing us to over-consume
   calories and gain weight. The recent findings of research into the
   relationship between energy balance and body weight have been reviewed.
   These findings reveal how a minor decrease in body weight (as little as
   2 or 3 percent) can result in significant overall health benefits,
   including reducing the risk of diabetes, cancer and other
   obesity-related illnesses. It has been concluded that when used as a
   substitute for sugar in foods and drinks, low calorie sweeteners can
   play a significant role in facilitating this level of weight loss and
   maintaining a healthy weight. The desire for sweetness hasn't changed in
   hundreds of years, but what has altered is that people are eating more
   and doing less exercise - all of which is contributing to rising obesity
   levels. Low calorie sweeteners can help provide a solution because they
   allow us to enjoy that sweet treat without contributing significantly to
   the overall daily calorie intake. The weight of considered scientific
   evidence, the result of careful, independent, expert scrutiny, again and
   again shows that there is no evidence of a risk to health. To argue
   otherwise, to turn problematic and discredited studies into certain,
   inviolable pronouncements, to intimate grand and global conspiracies, is
   to scare the public into abandoning an invaluable weapon in the fight
   against obesity.},

Abstract = {Using the example of the humorous science fiction novel Monday Begins on
   Saturday by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky (1964), the article discusses
   how intellectuals on both sides of the Iron Curtain, almost
   simultaneously, identified a crisis of faith in a fundamentally
   different future. Later called ``postmodern{''} and the period of
   ``cynical reason{''} (Peter Sloterdijk), a new era was characterized by
   a radically different perception of historical temporality. For several
   reasons, postwar mass culture and social sciences were isolated from
   theoretical physics that developed novel hypotheses, relying instead on
   outdated concepts of time. As a result, the popular and academic
   discussions of society promoted a cynical disbelief in the possibility
   of a truly unprecedented future and a fixation on the past and present
   as the only reality.
   The article argues that the Strugatsky brothers wrote the novel as a
   rebuttal to The Morning of the Magicians by Louis Pauwels and Jacques
   Bergier (1960), an archetypal text for New Age mysticism and modern
   conspiracy theories. Originally intended as a satire on mysticism and a
   manifesto of a humanist version of the communist future, eventually the
   Strugatskys found themselves in the same trap of presentism and
   identified their main target as crypto-Stalinists and cynics. They could
   not have been acquainted with Peter Sloterdijk's later influential
   treatise Critique of Cynical Reason (1983), which helps clarify,
   retrospectively, their take on the new age of cynicism. Surprisingly,
   despite its earlier creation, the Strugatskys' novel also sheds new
   light on Sloterdijk's work, resolving its major logical inconsistency.
   The novel also contains a potential solution to the predicament of
   ``cynical reason.{''}},

Abstract = {This article shows the problematic nature of modern studies that
   consider interrogation protocols of the Stalinist era to be reliable
   sources in their analyses. To begin with, these studies use primitive
   and inconsistent methodologies in their analysis of the interrogation
   protocols. Most of them approach the problem without the appropriate
   level of criticism, expressing little or no doubt about the content of
   these documents. Others, which claim to have adopted more specific
   methodological approaches, often base them on unverified hypotheses
   instead of empirically-proven principles. Secondly, these studies ignore
   recent work in neuroscience and cognitive, social, and clinical
   psychology that shows that coercion and torture undermine the ability of
   those under interrogation to give credible testimony. Biomedical studies
   have demonstrated that extremely stressful conditions (torture,
   coercion, blackmail, fear, deprivation of sleep and food, etc.) impair
   the function of the mind and erode its ability to retrieve reliable
   information from memory, especially affecting the accuracy and clarity
   of these recollections. Such techniques can significantly distort the
   testimony of detainees and even force those under interrogation to
   change their testimony, to repeat false information provided by the
   investigator or to falsely incriminate themselves. Thirdly, these
   studies overlook the fact that state security officials of that period
   systematically falsified interrogation protocols. Protocols, as a rule,
   were drawn up by the investigators and then were simply signed by those
   under interrogation - a practice that raises questions about how
   accurately these protocols convey the actual words, expressions and
   meanings contained in the elicited testimony. What's more, many
   investigators are known to have often added details or to have
   embellished the confessions, while others made up entire conspiracies
   from scratch, before forcing the suspects to sign protocols recording
   their false confessions. This article illustrates these theses with
   evidence from the case of A.V. Putintsev, a state security investigator
   between 1941-1954.},

Title = {Russian students in Tomsk University and the national policy of the late
   imperial Russia},
Journal = {RUSIN},

Number = {69},
Pages = {53-72},

Abstract = {The article examines the process of intellectual colonization in Russian
   Siberia in the late 19th - early 20th centuries. A nuanced approach to
   the national policy repertoire of the late imperial Russia allows
   tracing how similar political actions caused different effects on the
   western and eastern outskirts of the empire. The Russian majority of the
   student body formed at the Imperial Tomsk University (further referred
   to as ITU) in the late 1880s, when the trustee of the West Siberian
   Educational District Vasily Florinsky proposed to enroll graduates of
   Orthodox theological seminaries. This method was also used to russianize
   Warsaw and Yuriev (Derpt) Universities. However, this decision,
   initiated in relation to ITU, did not meet with unanimity in the ruling
   circles, since there were planty of radical leftists among the clergy
   students, who championed an autonomous Little Russian self-consciousness
   and became activists of the Ukrainian Students Zemlyachestvo during
   1909-1910. The admission of seminarians to universities in the western
   outskirts of the empire, which, unlike Siberia, were never destined to
   become Russian, had similar consequences. However, the strategic effects
   of these manipulations differed. It is assumed that the radicalism of
   ITU students was often exaggerated. The conspiracy interpretations of
   their activity in historical sources are explained by the atmosphere of
   distrust and confrontation between the ITU professors, the trustees of
   the West Siberian Educational District, and the Ministry of National
   Education. However, the consequences of Florinsky's project
   implementation manifested themselves over a long historical distance,
   when the educated class of Russians, who graduated from ITU, dispersed
   across Siberia. It was Florinsky's strategic aim, since he believed that
   the future of Siberia as a ``flourishing Russian province{''} was
   guaranteed not so much by the mechanical migration of Russians to the
   east, as by the expanding cultural hegemony of the Russian nation.},

Title = {Cytokines derived from innate lymphoid cells assist <i>Helicobacter
   hepaticus</i> to aggravate hepatocellular tumorigenesis in viral
   transgenic mice},
Journal = {GUT PATHOGENS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Background: Recently, intestinal microbiome has been involved in hepatic
   diseases due to the immunologic and metabolic communication between
   liver and intestine. Initiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
   frequently attributes to conspiracy between immune cells and infectious
   carcinogens. Here, the hypothesis that the tumorigenesis of HCC with HBV
   infection will be aggravated by specific intestinal bacteria was
   verified in viral transgenic mouse models.
   Methods: Comparative 16S rRNA sequencing was adopted to observe the
   intestinal enrichment of Helicobacter hepaticus in HCC. Oral
   administration of Helicobacter hepaticus was carried out to evaluate its
   hepatic carcinogenic effect in HBV transgenic mice or wildtype C57BL/6.
   The livers of experimental mice were collected and examined for the
   degree of tumorigenesis.
   Results: We found that Helicobacter hepaticus more likely colonized at
   lower colon of HBV-infected mice with HCC, compared with C57BL/6 and
   HBV-infected mice without neoplasm. Pretreatment of Helicobacter
   hepaticus in transgenic mice aggravated tumor formation, with higher
   incidence, more tumor nodule and higher serum AFP. Then, a cytokines
   expression patterns with inclined IFN-gamma, IFN-gamma R1, IL-17 and
   IL-23 was found in HBV-infected mice with Helicobacter hepaticus.
   Furthermore, innate lymphoid cells, especially Th17 and NK cells which
   can secret IL-17 and IFN-gamma respectively, might be recruited by
   Helicobacter hepaticus cooperated with HBV. Besides, increased
   expression of CD69, NKG2D and IFN-gamma showed activation of cytokine
   production in intrahepatic NK cells. Finally, IFN- decreased E-cadherin
   expression through p-STAT1 pathway, resulting in epithelial-mesenchymal
   transition with inclined expression of Snail2, SIP1 and CXCR4 in vitro.
   p-STAT1 inhibitor was able to reverse the expression of E-cadherin and
   EMT resulted from IFN- function on HBsAg-positive hepatocytes.
   Conclusions: Helicobacter hepaticus generate a detrimental immune
   microenvironment by IFN-gamma/p-STAT1 axis which can promote the
   tumorigenesis of hepatitis B via recruiting innate lymphoid cells.},

Abstract = {One year after his inauguration as President of the United States of
   America, this essay, which was written in December 2017, analyzes Donald
   Trump's behaviour in office. In comparison, the article focusses on
   similar populist developments in Europe, looking at the Alternative for
   Germany (AfD) and its Thuringian spokesman Bjorn Flocke.
   First, this article singles out the emotive potential of Trump's
   politics. It consults theoretical texts by Theodor W. Adorno and Hannah
   Arendt, comparing their classic theses with those of Uffa Jensen's essay
   Zornpolitik (Politics of Fury, 2017), which follows an ``emotion
   studies{''} approach. Like Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and
   others, Donald Trump tries to create a constant social atmosphere of
   fear and anger, based on various irrational concepts of some threatening
   Other. Disturbed by a subconscious self-hatred, this aggressive
   projection tries to fight any doubts about the greatness of Trump as a
   political leader and to silence any rational critique of the populist's
   actions as ``fake news{''}. Using an old German word, Uffa Jensen
   defines the central emotion of such politics as ``Hochmut{''}
   (disdainfulness). While journalists like Masha Gessen call Trump's
   government a near totalitarian regime, Jensen would locate Trump's sheer
   arrogant egoism in the familiar traditions of pure capitalistic
   ideology.
   Secondly, this essay focusses on Trump's use of the medium Twitter.
   While authors like Niels Werber, Thomas Hecken and Georg Sealen
   understand Trump's tweeting as a pop-cultural phenomenon, this article
   analyzes the mini-stories and conspiracy phantasies used in Trump's
   Twitter messages as effective ``pathos scenes{''} which try to create an
   enjoyable ``sense of commonality{''} (Hermann Kappelhoff) among his
   voters. Combined with the above described orientation of his politics,
   Trump's Twitter rhetoric even triggers antisemitic worldviews, as hailed
   by his followers among the White Supremacists and other racist groups.},

Title = {TRAITOR IN ONE'S RANKS: THE REPRESENTATION OF SERBIAN SOCIETY IN
   ARTICLES ABOUT THE HANDKE-CONTROVERSY 1996 IN SERBIAN PRINT MEDIA},
Journal = {FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA},
Year = {2017},
Number = {18, 1},
Pages = {193-211},
Abstract = {Peter Handke's text on Serbia A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for
   Serbia provoked a fierce controversy. While the debate in Western Europe
   and foremost in Germany is mostly part of scientific research on
   Handke's text, its reception in the countries of former Yugoslavia has
   hardly made a subject of discussion. This circumstance is remarkable
   especially since the text itself explicitly addresses also the audience
   in this area. Therefore, this article wants to give a short overview on
   the Coverage of the Handke-Controversy in Serbian Print-Media in 1996
   and shed light on the presentation of the Serbian society specifically.
   The question that is to be answered is, to what extend Serbian
   nationalist ideology, which dominated political discourse in Serbia at
   that time, played a role in the articles. To contextualize the analysis,
   at the beginning of the article Handke's view on literature is discussed
   as well as his text ``A Journey to the Rivers.{''} Presenting the
   results of the analysis the first two categories, that is ``The
   description of Peter Handke{''} and ``The description of the controversy
   in western media{''}, is given synthetically. They form the context for
   the third category, that is ``The description of Serbian society{''},
   which is given in more detail. The analysis shows, that the controversy
   was mainly seen as a further episode of the idea of a conspiracy of the
   western world against Serbia, which was widely spread in Serbia at that
   time. The protagonists of this episode (Handke, the West, Serbia) are
   described with the typical stereotypes in Serbian nationalism.
   Especially important is the accusation of a lack of culture in Serbian
   society. The call for peace that can be found in the text remained
   unconsidered.},

Abstract = {In May 1987, the U.S. Attorney's Office filed a federal indictment
   naming 36 co-conspirators in the largest anabolic steroid trafficking
   ring in history. A two-year federal investigation revealed a \$100
   million black market operating in the continental United States, of
   which an alleged 70\% was supplied by a rag-tag trio of would-be drug
   barons: David Jenkins, an Olympic silver medallist; Dan Duchaine, a
   successful author and renowned steroid authority; and William Dillon, an
   aeronautical engineer from the Midwest. Much like alcohol bootleggers in
   the Prohibition Era (1920-1933), the men capitalized on a void left in
   the market by increased government regulation. In the mid-1980s, a
   20-year drug review campaign spearheaded by the U.S. Food and Drug
   Administration culminated in the removal all anabolic steroids from the
   pharmaceutical market; a host of widely-used substances excised in one
   fell swoop. Revelations of systemic drug use in the Olympic Movement
   begot a paradigm shift in anti-doping enforcement in the early 1980s;
   however, no such shifts occurred in the legislative agenda. It was only
   after the ring was dismantled that American policy makers began to take
   notice, commencing in earnest a war on steroids that continues to rage
   on.},

Title = {Psychological determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among urban

Abstract = {IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has emerged
   as a promising approach to counter the harmful impacts of the pandemic.
   Understanding the psychological components that may impact an
   individual's attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination is crucial for
   generating evidence-based ways to minimize vaccine hesitancy. This study
   determined the psychological antecedents regarding vaccine acceptance
   among urban slum people of Bangladesh. MethodsFrom 5 July to 5 August 5,
   2021, a face-to-face survey was conducted in the urban slum of two large
   cities in Bangladesh. The questionnaire considered socio-demographics,
   health-related characteristics, psychological determinants, sources of
   information, and conspiracy beliefs regarding COVID-19. The 5C
   sub-scales were used to assess psychological antecedents. Five stepwise
   binary logistic regression models evaluated significant predictors for
   confidence, complacency, calculation, constraints, and collective
   responsibility. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine
   the relationship between psychological antecedents and vaccine
   acceptability. ResultsThe study revealed that the slum residents with a
   high level of confident (89.94\%), complacent (72.73\%), having
   constraints (82.31\%), calculative (84.80\%), and responsible (93.30\%)
   showed a higher vaccine acceptance rate. Higher vaccine acceptance was
   related to the believer in natural-made origin (85.96\%) and those who
   rejected anti-vaccination (88.44\%). The information acquired from
   newspapers differed significantly (p < 0.05), though TV or radio was the
   most common primary information source about COVID-19 vaccines
   (74.75\%). The regression result revealed that marital status,
   education, family income, and perceived health condition were
   significantly associated with the 5C domains. Two psychological
   antecedents including complacency (OR = 3.97; p < 0.001) and collective
   responsibility (OR = 0.23; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with
   vaccine acceptance. ConclusionsDifferent predictors significantly affect
   psychological antecedents related to COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Therefore,
   considering the factors, targeted actions based on the findings may help
   to lower vaccine reluctance and boost vaccination rates.},

Abstract = {Objective Telephone availability is integrated into our home-based
   palliative care team (HPCT) with the aim of helping terminally ill
   patients and their caregivers alleviate their physical and psychosocial
   suffering, in addition to the team's home visits. We aimed to compare
   the differences between non-callers (patients with no phone calls during
   the team's follow-up period) vs. callers (>= 1 phone call during the
   team's follow-up period) across sociodemographic, clinical, physical,
   and psychosocial variables. Method Retrospective analysis of all
   patients with and without phone call entries registered in our
   anonymized database, from October 2018 to September 2020. Results We
   analyzed 389 patients: 58\% were male, and the average age was 71 years
   old; 84\% had malignancies, with a mean palliative performance status of
   45\%. The majority of patients (n = 281, 72\%) made at least one phone
   call to HPCT. On average, a mean of 2.5 calls (SD = 3.61; range: 0-26)
   per patient was registered. Callers compared with non-callers more
   frequently lived with someone (p = 0.030), preferred home as a place to
   die (p = 0.039), had more doctor (p = 0.010) and nurse home visits (p =
   0.006), a prolonged HPCT follow-up time (p = 0.053), along with more
   frequent emergency room visits (p < 0.001) and hospitalizations (p =
   0.043). Moreover, those who made at least one phone call to the HPCT had
   a higher frequency of conspiracy of silence (p = 0.046), anxiety (p =
   0.044), and lower palliative performance status (p = 0.001). No
   statistically significant associations or differences were found for the
   other variables. Significance of results Several factors seem to
   correlate with an increased number of phone calls, and physical
   suffering does not play a relevant role in triggering contacts, in
   contrast with psychosocial and other clinical factors.},

Abstract = {There is progress, in the sense that although the energies assigned to
   cosmic rays by air shower arrays may need reducing by about 20\%, energy
   measurements are consistent at about this level, and several experiments
   now accord with a spectrum which astonishingly shows no GZK cut-off near
   10(20) eV, greatly limiting the possible source regions. The simplest
   interpretation is that few cosmic rays above 10(19) eV come from
   hundreds of Mpc, contrary to expectation on geometrical grounds. Most of
   the arrival directions of showers above 4 x 10(19) eV show little
   correlation with the supergalaxy or with matter concentrations within
   200 Mpc. The implications of the spectrum and the arrival directions are
   discussed. The most likely explanations of their unexpected features are
   either (a) that these cosmic rays come mainly from the decay of
   cosmological relic particles clustered in a large galactic halo (though
   not if photons really do form a large part of the decay spectrum), or
   (b) that local intergalactic magnetic fields are unexpectedly strong,
   and disguise the position of and enhance one extraordinary source within
   a few Mpc, or (c) most particles above 10(19) eV are very different from
   protons after all, and do not have a threshold for serious energy loss
   as low as 10(20) eV, or (d) that there is a conspiracy of matching
   fluxes, so that most cosmic rays above 10(19) eV are from widespread
   extragalactic sources, but a superimposed hard spectrum from decaying
   halo relic particles neatly reduces the magnitude of the GZK fall-off
   above 10(20) eV. Several close pairs of arrival directions may yet turn
   out to be accidental, but if not, explanations (a) and (b) fail. There
   are several diagnostic tests to be made by the well-placed first
   (Southern) Auger Project detector and the High-Resolution Fly's Eye
   detector.},

Title = {Political repression in the United States},
Journal = {ACTES DE LA RECHERCHE EN SCIENCES SOCIALES},
Year = {1997},
Number = {120},
Pages = {32+},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article, originaly published in English over a decade ago,
   defamilarizes the account of the United States as the land of the free.
   Placing a contersubversive tradition at the center of American history,
   the paper identifies three major moments in the history of American
   political repression, each building on and incorporating its
   predecessors. The first moment was racial, pitting whites against
   peoples of color and placing race at the center of the most important
   divisions in American life. Class and ethnic conflict defined the second
   moment, whereas the cold war introduced the third; the Soviet Union
   replaced the immigrant working class as the source of anxiety, class
   conflict gave way to mass society, and the combat between workers and
   capitalists, immigrants and natives, was replaced by one between
   Moscow's agents and a national security stare. A fourth moment, in which
   Americans now live, was succeeding the third as the essay was being
   written. That moment, stigmatizing ``illegal aliens{''}, unwed mothers
   on welfare, and young black men, returns to the racialized origins of
   the United States.
   The full essay, which also discusses antebellum anti-Catholicism and
   other conspiracy fears, the emergence of the prison, the confinement of
   women, and the disciplining of private life, will appear in my Les
   Demons d'Amerique (Editions du Seuil, 1998). The version here, after a
   brief reference to American origins in racial violence, picks up the
   story after the Civil War. It chronicles the suppression of the radical
   labor movement, punctuated by a series of red scares; the rise of a
   state security bureaucracy obsessed with internal disloyalty; and the
   repression of the movements for racial equality and against the war in
   Vietnam that, spreading to covert operations against powerful
   established institutions, ultimately forced President Richard Nixon to
   resign.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Objective: The present study integrates several distinct lines of jury
   decision-making research by examining how the racial identities of the
   defendant and an informant witness interact in a federal drug conspiracy
   trial scenario and by assessing whether jurors' individual racial
   identity and jury group racial composition influence their judgments.
   Hypotheses: We predicted that jurors would be biased against the Black
   defendant and would be more likely to convict after exposure to a White
   informant, among other hypotheses. Method: We recruited 822 nonstudent
   jury-eligible participants assigned to 144 jury groups. Each group was
   assigned to one of four onditions where defendant race (Black or White)
   and informant race (Black or White) was manipulated. Each group watched
   a realistic audio-visual trial presentation, then deliberated as a group
   to render a verdict. Results: Contrary to expectations, the conditions
   depicting a Black defendant yielded lower conviction rates compared to
   those with a White defendant-at both the predeliberation individual
   (odds ratio {[}OR] = 1.54) and postdeliberation group level (OR =
   2.91)-while the informant race did not influence verdict outcomes. We
   also found that jurors rated the government witnesses as more credible
   when the defendant was White compared to when he was Black. Credibility
   ratings and verdict outcomes were also predicted by jurors' own race,
   although juror race did not interact with the race conditions when
   predicting verdicts. Conclusions: Jurors are sensitive to defendant
   race, and this sensitivity appears to strengthen after deliberation-but
   in a direction opposite to what was expected. One potential implication
   of our findings is that juries may operate as a check on system bias by
   applying greater scrutiny to law enforcement-derived evidence when the
   defendant is Black.},

Abstract = {Background Vaccine-related diseases are increasing in developing
   countries. This study aimed to explore parents reasons for refusal of
   childhood vaccinations in Malaysia and their recommendations on
   addressing their concerns.
   Methods A qualitative study design involving individual both
   face-to-face and online in-depth interview was used. The topic guide was
   developed from the Health Belief Model theoretical framework. Seven
   face-to-face and seven online interviews were conducted with parents in
   the Klang Valley (an urban area) who had refused childhood vaccination.
   All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and checked.
   Thematic approach was used to analyze the data. Data was collected until
   data saturation was reached.
   Results Findings were summarized into two main categories: Personal
   Health Beliefs and Vaccine Related Concerns. Six personal health beliefs
   were identified: lack of confidence in modern medicine and health care
   personnel, pharmaceutical conspiracy to sell medicines, preference to a
   natural approach to health, personal instincts, religious beliefs and
   having a partner with similar beliefs. Four main vaccine-related
   concerns were identified: negative effects and content concerns, doubts
   of necessity and lack of information and knowledge regarding vaccines.
   Parents recommended that more empathy from healthcare professionals and
   evidence on safety and content purity would help them reconsider
   vaccination.
   Conclusion Parents had multiple reasons for refusing childhood
   vaccinations but felt that communication and empathy from healthcare
   professionals was lacking. Besides individual consultations with
   parents, addressing these concerns at multiple levels in the health care
   system and society may help to increase the uptake of childhood
   vaccinations in the future.(c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {In the last decades, there has been a significant increase in the number
   of lifestyle and auto-immune diseases, such as various cancers or
   multiple sclerosis. In countries where cannabis is decriminalized for
   medical purposes, it is most often prescribed for these diagnoses.
   Today, over 700 different cannabis genotypes are being bred, and it is
   very important to describe in detail their cultivation, potential
   yields, chemical profile and stability, to be recommended to a
   particular patient with a specific diagnosis. The aim of this study was
   to evaluate the inflorescence yields and the content of
   Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) of
   seven traditional genotypes of cannabis - Conspiracy Kush, Nurse Jackie,
   Jilly Bean, Nordle, Jack Cleaner 2, Jack Skellington and National Health
   Services. The plants were grown under controlled climatic conditions
   during six growing cycles at a density of 9 plants/m(2). Dried
   inflorescences from each plant were homogenized and analyzed by gas
   chromatography with flame ionization detection. The average yield per
   plant was 21.02 +/- 3.33 g and the highest yields showed genotype Nurse
   Jackie (24.74 +/- 6.11 g). The lowest yields were shown by genotype Jack
   Skellington (15.41 +/- 4.02 g). Average Delta(9)-THC levels for each
   variety in all 6 growing cycles ranged from 15.69 +/- 2.6 \% to 19.31
   +/- 2.47 \% (w/w). The lowest contents of Delta(9)-THC were measured in
   the Nordle genotype and the highest values were found in the Jack
   Cleaner 2 and Jack Skellington genotypes. Average CBD levels in the
   plants ranged from 0.45 +/- 0.1 \% to 0.57 +/- 0.08 \% (w/w) over six
   individual cycles. This study shows that among genotypes studied, the
   best parameters - high yield and stable cannabinoids production - are
   shown by genotypes Nurse Jackie and Jilly Bean.},

Abstract = {Background: In July 2021, in France, the hashtag ``\#NousSavons{''}
   ({''}\#WeKnow{''}) emerged, aimed at rallying COVID skeptics on Twitter.
   Creating a genuine online community, this hashtag mobilized its members
   by having them question dominant forms of knowledge. This article
   examines the architecture of the discourses developed by the members of
   the \#NousSavons community.Analysis: The analysis considers two of this
   community's initiatives that supported a conspiracy-based perception of
   COVID-19: establishing the legitimacy of their perception of the crisis
   and publicizing this perception.Conclusions and implications: This
   article shows the diversity of evidence put forward by the community as
   well as the latter's singular positioning with regard to the truth. It
   also analyzes the refinement of the communication practices that were
   implemented in order to convince members of the public sphere of the
   legitimacy of their viewpoint.
   Contexte : En juillet 2021, en France, le mot-clic \#NousSavons regroupe
   les sceptiques de la COVID-19 sur Twitter. Reel cluster, ce mot-clic
   positionne la mobilisation directement sur le plan du savoir. Cet
   article examine l'architecture du discours que composent les membres de
   la communaute \#NousSavons.Analyse : L'analyse prend en compte deux
   productions de cette communaute qui viennent soutenir une perception
   complotiste de la COVID-19 : la mise en place de gages de legitimite
   devant confirmer leur perception de la crise et la mise en visibilite de
   ces gages.Conclusions et implications : Cet article montre la diversite
   des preuves mises en place par la communaute ainsi qu'un positionnement
   singulier eu egard a la verite. Il analyse egalement le raffinement des
   pratiques communicationnelles mises en oe uvre dans le but de convaincre
   les membres de l'espace public.},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: Little is known regarding the 5C
   psychological antecedents to COVID-19 vaccination among pharmacists in
   low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to assess the
   acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and its psychological antecedents
   among community pharmacists in Khartoum State, Sudan. Materials and
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from July to September
   2022. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data about
   sociodemographic and health status characteristics, vaccine acceptance,
   and the 5C psychological antecedents to vaccination. Stepwise logistic
   regression analysis was conducted, and results were presented using odds
   ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: A total of 382 community pharmacists participated in the
   current study, with a mean age of 30.4 +/- 5.6 years. Nearly two-thirds
   of the participants (65.4\%) were females, and the majority (74.9\%)
   have received or intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine
   acceptance was significantly associated with the following psychological
   antecedents to vaccination: confidence, complacency, constraints, and
   calculation (p < 0.001). Results of the logistic regression showed that
   confidence in vaccines {[}OR = 6.82 (95\% CI = 3.14-14.80)], conspiracy
   beliefs {[}OR = 0.44 (95\% CI = 0.23-0.85)], and constraints to
   vaccination {[}OR = 0.18 (95\% CI = 0.06-0.56)] were the significant
   determinants of vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: The study revealed
   important predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance that can be used to
   guide policymakers in designing target-oriented interventions that can
   improve the vaccine acceptance rate among community pharmacists in
   Sudan. These findings suggest that interventions to promote vaccine
   acceptance among pharmacists should focus on building confidence in
   vaccines and providing accurate information about the safety and
   efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, and reducing constraints to
   vaccination.},

Abstract = {Public Significance Statement In this study, a new 6-item questionnaire
   was developed for assessing the extent to which people mistrust medical
   authorities (the Medical Mistrust Multiformat Scale). Results
   demonstrate that this scale performs better than a widely used existing
   scale and that medical mistrust is important for understanding vaccine
   hesitancy, adherence to medical treatment plans, and quality of
   patient-practitioner relationships.
   The assessment of medical mistrust is essential to progress in
   understanding behavioral health outcomes such as vaccine hesitancy,
   treatment adherence, and patient-practitioner relationships. To address
   limitations of existing medical mistrust scales and to address a need
   for clear psychometric information, a new Medical Mistrust Multiformat
   Scale (MMMS) was developed and tested. Study 1 included 741 Black and
   White participants with hypertension, with one subsample used for item
   selection and a second for cross-validation. Study 2 included 234
   lower-income participants with diabetes or hypertension representing
   diverse racial/ethnic identities. All participants were recruited via
   marketing panels to complete online questionnaires. In both studies, the
   MMMS fit a unidimensional factor structure; items demonstrated high
   discrimination; and the scale was correlated with vaccine compliance. In
   Study 1, measurement invariance was demonstrated across Black and White
   groups. In Study 2, the MMMS correlated with additional tested outcomes
   regarding treatment adherence and patient-practitioner relationships,
   all effects remained significant after controlling for other related
   variables (conspiracy beliefs, race/ethnicity, political affiliation,
   stress), and the MMMS produced significantly larger convergent validity
   effects than a widely used existing mistrust scale. Results highlight
   the importance of medical mistrust and support use of the MMMS to assess
   mistrust in populations that include people with diverse racial/ethnic
   identities, people with chronic medical conditions, and people with
   lower incomes.},

Abstract = {Purpose In a context of critical transition such as the COVID-19
   pandemic, moral semantics take a prominent role as a form of
   self-description of society. However, they are not usually observed, but
   rather assumed as self-evident and necessarily ``good.{''} The purpose
   of the article is to summarize the theory of morality from the social
   systems' perspective and illustrate with concrete examples the
   polemogenous nature of moral communication. Design/methodology/approach
   This article presents an analysis of the role of morality in the context
   of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the perspective of Niklas Luhmann's
   social systems theory. Applying the method of second-order observation,
   it describes three cases of moral semantics disseminated via mass media
   and social media, and it examines their connection with the structural
   situation of subsystems of society during the pandemic crisis
   (particularly healthcare, politics and science). Findings Second-order
   observation of moral communication demonstrates to be fruitful to
   describe the conditions and consequences in which moralization of
   communication occurs, particularly in a situation of critical transition
   around the healthcare crisis. The three examples examined, namely, the
   hero semantics directed to healthcare workers, the semantics of
   indiscipline and the controversies around pseudo-sciences and conspiracy
   theories, show how they are based on social attribution of esteem and
   disesteem, how they try to answer to troublesome situations and
   contradictions that seem difficult to cope, and how they are close
   related to the emergence of conflicts, even when they seem positive
   oriented and well intentioned. Originality/value This paper is an
   attempt to test the usefulness of Luhmann's theory of society to
   understand the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and particularly the role of
   moral communication in concrete examples.},

Title = {9/11 Truth and the Silence of the IR Discipline},
Journal = {ALTERNATIVES},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {International Relations (IR) scholars uncritically accept the official
   narrative regarding the events of 9/11 and refuse to examine the massive
   body of evidence generated by the 9/11 truth movement. Nevertheless, as
   calls for a new inquiry into the events of 9/11 continue to mount, with
   the International 9/11 Consensus Panel and World Trade Centre Building 7
   Evaluation inquiries having recently published their findings, and with
   a U.S. Federal Grand Jury on 9/11 having been announced, now would be an
   opportune moment for IR scholars to start taking the claims of 9/11
   truth seriously. A survey of the 9/11 truth literature reveals that the
   official 9/11 narrative cannot be supported at multiple levels. Two
   planes did not bring down three towers in New York. There is no hard
   evidence that Muslims were responsible for 9/11 other than in a patsy
   capacity. Various U.S. government agencies appear to have had
   foreknowledge of the events and to have covered up evidence. Important
   questions regarding the hijacked planes need answering, as do questions
   about the complicity of the mainstream media in 9/11. IR scholars avoid
   looking at evidence regarding the events of 9/11 for several reasons.
   They may be taken in by the weaponized term, ``conspiracy theory.{''} A
   taboo on questioning the ruling structures of society means that
   individuals do not wish to fall outside the spectrum of acceptable
   opinion. Entertaining the possibility that 9/11 was a false flag
   requires Westerners to reject fundamental assumptions that they have
   been socialized to accept since birth. The ``War on Terror{''} has
   created a neo-McCarthyite environment in which freedom to speak out has
   been stifled. Yet, if IR scholars are serious about truth, the first
   place they need to start is 9/11 truth.},

Abstract = {After the outbreak of the Pacific War, while considering taking back the
   Japaneseoccupied areas, the Nationalist government also started to think
   of recovering the frontier regions, which had been somewhat out of
   China's control under the influence of a major ally of China, the USSR.
   For a long time, Xinjiang had a very close relationship with the Soviet
   Union under the rule of Sheng Shicai, and the central government of
   China had little direct control. In April of 1942, Sheng Shicai,
   suspicious of a Soviet conspiracy to overthrow his rule, conducted mass
   arrests in Xinjiang, causing a sudden deterioration in the relationship
   between Xinjiang and the Soviets. At first, the Soviet Union attempted
   to intimidate Sheng in order to prevent him from turning to the central
   government, but failed. Paying no heed to the alienation policy of the
   Soviets, the Nationalist government soon decided to buttress Sheng in an
   effort to place Xinjiang under centralized control. The Nationalist
   government first set out to take back the diplomacy of Xinjiang,
   followed by expropriation of formerly Soviet-controlled enterprises and
   forced removal of Soviet military advisors, experts, technicians and
   army personnel from Xinjiang. In the meantime, a large number of party,
   government, economic, cultural and educational personnel were dispatched
   by the central government to Xinjiang to infiltrate various sectors.
   With the weakening of his own power and increasing conflicts with the
   central government, Sheng Shicai planned another turn of events. By
   executing a new round-up, this time to cleanse Xinjiang of the central
   government's forces, Sheng re-oriented his regime towards the Soviet
   Union. Yet his gesture was turned down by the USSR because of his loss
   of credibility. Well prepared militarily, the Nationalist government
   eventually forced Sheng Shicai to leave Xinjiang, which then was almost
   fully restored to the authority of the central government.},

Title = {Just asking questions: can a far-right president turn agentic knowledge
   construction into political manipulation?},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND LEARNING SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {124},

Pages = {197-220},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {PurposeThere are several connections between education and
   disinformation, including the association between years of schooling and
   vulnerability to unfounded hypothesizing. The purpose of this paper is
   to inquire into a competing explanation: political leaders might be
   exploring powerful teaching and learning strategies to disseminate
   agendas based on baseless assumptions, exploiting human's tendency to
   generate robust theories even with incomplete or incorrect information.
   Design/methodology/approachThe authors analyzed ten videos published
   online by a highly partisan YouTube channel. The footage contained
   informal encounters between former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro
   and supporters in front of his official residence. The team sought to
   answer two research questions: Do Mr Bolsonaro's discursive moves
   include activators that lead the audience to understand that they are
   theorizing and reaching conclusions ``on their own?{''} Does Mr
   Bolsonaro's audience follow those clues and mention politically
   motivated hoaxes and conspiracy theories in their comments? This paper
   draws on perspectives from the field of educational research to
   investigate the mechanisms used by the president to shape public
   opinion. FindingsThe authors found evidence of the employment of
   elements akin to classroom discourse in the dialogues led by Mr
   Bolsonaro. Specifically, different types of rhetorical questions are
   present to a substantial extent in the data subset analyzed for this
   paper. Originality/valueThis work offers an alternative perspective to
   analyzing disinformation. By drawing from established literature from
   education research, this paper departs from facile explanations that
   take for granted the lack of intelligence of the audience. Conversely,
   it argues that popular, if not powerful, teaching and learning
   strategies might play an undesired role by shaping individuals'
   cognitive processes to create robust, internally consistent theories
   about the world using flawed assumptions and incorrect ``building
   blocks.{''}},

   and opinions on the monkeypox virus and related public health issues.
   Methods We analyzed English-language tweets using the keyword
   ``monkeypox{''} from 1 May to 23 July 2022. We reported gender,
   ethnicity, and race of Twitter users and analyzed tweets to identify
   predominant sentiment and emotions. We performed topic modeling and
   compared cohorts of users who self-identify as LGBTQ+ (an abreviation
   for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and/or questioning)
   allies versus users who do not, and cohorts identified as ``bots{''}
   versus humans. Results A total of 48 330 tweets were written by LGBTQ+
   self-identified advocates or allies. The mean sentiment score for all
   tweets was -0.413 on a -4 to +4 scale. Negative tweets comprised 39\% of
   tweets. The most common emotions expressed were fear and sadness. Topic
   modeling identified unique topics among the 4 cohorts analyzed.
   Conclusions The spread of mis- and disinformation about monkeypox was
   common in our tweet library. Various conspiracy theories about the
   origins of monkeypox, its relationship to global economic concerns, and
   homophobic and racial comments were common. Conversely, many other
   tweets helped to provide information about monkeypox vaccines, disease
   symptoms, and prevention methods. Discussion of rising monkeypox case
   numbers globally was also a large aspect of the conversation.
   Conclusions We demonstrated that Twitter is an effective means of
   tracking sentiment about public healthcare issues. We gained insight
   into a subset of people, self-identified LGBTQ+ allies, who were more
   affected by monkeypox.},

Title = {Political tolerance in Europe: The role of conspiratorial thinking and
   cosmopolitanism},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Tolerance has long been identified as a crucial feature of liberal
   democracies. Although the limits of tolerance are debated, the extent to
   which citizens are open and willing to accommodate others who are
   different from them is often regarded as a sign of a healthy and
   well-functioning liberal democracy. The goal of this paper is to
   empirically investigate the state of political tolerance in Europe
   today. The main questions we ask are: What explains the different levels
   of tolerance across individuals in various countries? Which groups in
   society are the most likely targets of intolerance? We understand
   political tolerance as the willingness to allow the free articulation of
   interests and ideas in the political system of groups one opposes.
   Previous research emphasizes education, civic activism and threat
   perceptions as important determinants of tolerance. We redirect the
   debate to a set of novel correlates of tolerance. We argue that
   conspiratorial thinking and cosmopolitanism are critical factors that
   explain levels of tolerance among Europeans. The analysis employs
   original survey data collected as part of a mass survey conducted in
   2017 in 10 European Union member states: Czech Republic, France,
   Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the
   United Kingdom. Our descriptive analysis shows that far-right groups
   (i.e., fascists and neo-Nazis) and Muslims are the most disliked groups
   in Europe. When it comes to the level of tolerance towards these groups,
   we find that more than half of the respondents in each country are
   willing to deny their most disliked group parliamentary representation.
   Moreover, we find that even after controlling for traditional
   determinants of tolerance, conspiratorial thinking and cosmopolitanism
   emerge as the most important predictors of political tolerance. Our
   analysis suggests that the recent rapid spread of various conspiracy
   theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have far-reaching
   implications for tolerance as well.},

Title = {The new normal: Covid-19 risk perceptions and support for continuing
   restrictions past vaccinations},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {I test the possibility that over-estimating negative consequences of
   COVID-19 (e.g., hospitalizations, deaths, and threats to children) will
   be associated with stronger support the `new normal' (i.e., continuation
   of restrictions for an undefined period starting with wide-spread access
   to vaccines and completed vaccinations of vulnerable people). The new
   normal was assessed by endorsing practices such as vaccine passports,
   travel restrictions, mandatory masking, continuing contact tracing, and
   pursuing elimination. Results are based on five samples (N = 1,233 from
   April 2021 and N = 264 from January 2022) and suggest that people
   over-estimate COVID-19 risks to children and healthy people, as
   evidenced by median estimates that 5\% of all global deaths were
   children, 29\% were generally healthy people under 65, and that a
   healthy person under the age of 65 has 5\% chance of dying from
   COVID-19. Over-estimates observed in this study align with those based
   on representative samples, and they were consistently related to
   stronger support for the new normal. This relationship emerged when
   participants estimated risks with percentages (core indicators) and
   indicated the extent to which risk-based statements are true/supported
   with evidence or false/unsupported (alternative indicators). People were
   notably more likely to support continuing restrictions if they believed
   that COVID-19 risk and risk mitigation tactics are true, even when they
   are not (e.g., children need to be prioritized for boosters). These
   relationships persisted when considering competing explanations
   (political ideology, statistics literacy, belief in conspiracy
   theories). I trace these effects to well-meaning efforts to prevent
   under-estimation. Public policy and people's perceptions of risks are
   intertwined, where even inaccurate judgments may influence decisions.
   Failure to combat all misinformation with equal rigor may jeopardize the
   restoration of the social and economic life essential for building
   adaptive post-pandemic societies.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether the clustering of initial public offering
   (IPO) spreads in the IPO market occurs through competition or collusion,
   using the period from January 2000 to July 2006 as the analytical range.
   It finds that the Korean IPO market spread is clustered at 3.5\% on
   moderately sized IPOs (i.e., IPOs between 9 (KRW billion) and 33 (KRW
   billion)), representing a 74\% overall rate that increases gradually
   over time. Our empirical results refute the collusion theory. The Korean
   IPO market is characterised by low concentration. A 3.5\% spread does
   not represent abnormal profits relative to other IPOs. Cost saving (i.e.
   an inverse U shape) is confirmed by the use of 3.5\% offers. Our results
   also show that factors typically related to underwriters and issuers
   such as proceeds, secondary sales, earnings and reputation affect the
   3.5\% spread used both positively and negatively. Thus, consistent with
   the efficient contract theory, the use of a 3.5\% contract becomes less
   likely as proceeds increase but becomes more likely for IPOs of over 35
   (KRW billion). On the one hand, the use of a 3.5\% contract becomes more
   likely the more insider shares an IPO contains and the higher the
   volatility of the stock return (an insignificant factor). On the other
   hand, the use of a 3.5\% contract becomes less likely the higher the
   earnings and debt (insignificant factors) and the more reputable the
   underwriter. Underpricing in 3.5\% IPOs is conditioned by proceeds and
   secondary sales, not reputation and IPO market concentration. Thus, we
   conclude against the cartel theory that there is no collusive conspiracy
   in the Korean IPO market and that underwriters do not reap excess
   profits from 3.5\% IPOs.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to identifying the role of the Finnish scientist
   Yrjo Jooseppi Wichmann in the formation and development of Udmurt
   folkloristics. In Udmurt sciences, Yrjo Wichmann is represented as a
   linguist, one of the founders of comparative historical permistics, who
   made a huge contribution to Udmurt dialectology, historical phonetics,
   historical lexicology and etymology. However, the role of the Finnish
   scientist as a folklorist, who laid the foundations for the principles
   of recording and publishing folklore material, including music, has not
   yet been appreciated in Finno-Ugric studies.
   He made two long trips to the Udmurts in order to study some Udmurt
   dialects, there he recorded a significant corpus of samples of Udmurt
   speech. The corpus is composed of different genres of Udmurt folklore:
   songs, conspiracies, prayers, riddles, legends, etc., published in two
   volumes of ``Wotjakische sprachproben{''} (1893; 1901). In addition,
   possessing musical notation, he recorded and published a corpus of
   melodies of Udmurt ritual songs, which have become a valuable source for
   modern comparative research. A rare success of the Finnish researcher
   should be considered records of rare instrumental tunes that accompanied
   pagan prayers.
   Publishing and describing folklore material, Yu. Vihmann, as a
   linguist-dialectologist, used the areal method, and for the first time
   used the folkloristic principles of classification, dividing the
   folklore material of each dialect into genre-thematic groups. At the
   same time, Yu. Wichmann, the first scientist in the history of Udmurt
   folkloristics, applied ethnomusicological methods in describing the
   genre system, the structure of melodies and the performing manner. Yrjo
   Wichmann rightfully occupies a prominent place in the history of Udmurt
   folklore studies. To a certain extent, he was ahead of his time, using
   the methodology and principles of working with folklore material, which
   have become fundamental in modern Russian folklore studies.},

Title = {When the Crystal Boys Meet the Rebellious Daughter: Investigating Pai

Abstract = {Based on the textual analyses, intertextual dialogisms, literary
   interpretations, and cultural criticisms of Crystal Boys (1983), a
   canonical Chinese modernist novel that features gay relationships, and
   The Rebellious Daughter (1996), a renowned contemporary Chinese novel
   that concerns lesbian relationships, the present paper seeks to probe
   into the discursive tug of war between a non-homosexual reading and a
   homosexual interpretation of the two controversial novels published in
   Taiwan across a chronological gap of thirteen years. It attempts to
   achieve a bird's eye view of the connections between the evolutionary
   changes of literary interpretative tendency and the development of
   homosexual discourse in Taiwan. Apart from contrasting the themes and
   major concerns of the two novels and analyzing similarities and
   differences in their social and historical backgrounds, the research
   also strives to compare their arts in the light of homographesis so as
   to lay bare their respective skills of homosexual representation. The
   paper argues that: Crystal Boys features a nuanced convergence of stream
   of consciousness and realistic representation whereas The Rebellious
   Daughter resorts to an outright realistic representational strategy; the
   former combines both traditional literary style and colloquial
   vernacular whereas the latter excels at characterization by means of
   overt appropriation of Minnan dialect. The comparative study goes so far
   as to point out the subtle contrapuntal writing between the two novels.
   Altogether, drawing on important accessible literature regarding the
   academic interpretations and critical comments of the two novels, the
   study aims to uncover latent ideological conspiracies looming in the
   established interpretations of the two novels so as to expose the
   camouflaged stigmatization imposed upon gay and lesbian scenarios by
   heterosexual hegemony, if not by patriarchal familism. Such scenarios
   have been wrought to forge literary construction of homosexual
   subjectivity and gay/lesbian political consciousness, one that has been
   inscribed in Pai Hsien-yung's and Du Xiu-Lan's respective novelistic
   writings.},

Title = {Is 80\% a passing grade? Meanings attached to condom use in an
   abstinence-plus HIV prevention programme in South Africa},
Journal = {AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {213-220},
Abstract = {This study represents the first qualitative exploration of how condoms
   are perceived by at-risk youth, their parents, their teachers and HIV
   prevention programme staff in an abstinence-plus HIV prevention
   programme. Behavioural interventions for HIV prevention with youth may
   be divided into three categories, each with a different approach to
   condoms: abstinence-only, abstinence-plus and comprehensive approaches.
   Research has highlighted the limitations of abstinence-only approaches
   and the emergence of early support for abstinence-plus interventions as
   HIV prevention strategies. Furthermore, research consistently
   demonstrates that condoms are socially mediated, reflecting diverse
   norms. However, there is a gap in the literature in terms of how condom
   use is framed, understood and represented by those delivering and
   receiving an abstinence-plus programme. This is critically important
   because advocates of a comprehensive approach to HIV prevention have
   flagged concern with the degree to which abstinence-plus programming may
   undermine confidence in condom use. Therefore, this study analyses
   meanings attached to condom use by stakeholders in an abstinence-plus
   HIV prevention programme in South Africa. Results demonstrate diverse
   meanings attached to condom use, including: condoms as second best to
   abstinence; condoms as a gendered response to HIV; condoms as a source
   of mockery; condoms as futile in a high-prevalence setting; condoms as
   part of conspiracy beliefs along racial and colonial lines; and, condoms
   as popular in HIV prevention because they can be counted. These findings
   have particular bearing for abstinence-plus HIV prevention programmes,
   which face the double challenge of (1) engaging with condom promotion in
   a way that takes into account their diverse social meanings, and (2)
   promoting condoms within their hierarchical framework of options in a
   way that does not inadvertently discourage their use.},

Abstract = {The name of Neeltje Jans comes from prehistoric times, born in the
   hidden Flemish and Dutch past, at the border of the Helle, now called
   the North Sea. The `hell' (Helle, Houle, Holle, Holle, Harle) was the
   place of the dead in the past, as the sea was the major cause of death.
   Neeltje Jans was the Goddess of the sea like Gaia was the mother of the
   earth. Neeltje Jans brought mythical security, stabilizing the emotion
   of anxiety in an unstable world without dikes and drainages.
   Rijkswaterstaat took over her role, producing security in living with
   water by technological means. Our twentieth century brought a technology
   that was admirable and powerful, but Neeltje Jans wept, as she had
   discovered that her intellectual child, called rationality, was
   blind-born. At first she kept her discovery secret, taking part in an
   unintended conspiracy of the twentieth century against the logic of
   feeling, which was called subjective and irrational. But blind
   rationality, pretending not to know what is quality and value, was going
   to Loose the battle of the mind. In the recent development of the
   philosophy of technology, water is no longer an enemy, but a field of
   work for value and quality. This new development of Dutch water
   technology makes Neeltje Jans smile, her hidden logic has been
   recognized by the engineer and by a growing public encouragement. Almost
   half a million people come each year to share the promise of the
   philosophy of Neeltje Jans, along the Line of the unconscious logic of
   feeling and without knowing consciously why. This paper intends to clear
   up the poetic mystery and the hidden steering of the logic of feeling
   behind the new technology of living with water.},

Abstract = {Purpose - To identify the reason of Japan not complying with the
   Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendation 35 and suggesting a
   strategic solution to overcoming the barrier.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through contextual, historical, and legal
   analysis of the anti-money laundering (AML) measures in Japan.
   Findings - This paper implies that less flexible mindsets in stone of
   major players in the field of AML measures in Japan are the fundamental
   barrier for Japan not complying with the FATF Recommendation 35, while
   this paper suggests better realistic ways to address the barrier.
   Originality/value - The novel point of this paper is that this paper
   illustriously uncovers the mindsets of the major players pertaining to
   the Japanese AML measures in a very illustrative way, points out the
   underlying true barrier, and describes a useful strategy desperately
   needed to address the barrier.},

Title = {RUSSIAN SCIENCE FICTION IN THE GENRE OF ALTERNATIVE HISTORY AS A
   REFLECTION OF MASS CONSCIOUSNESS: SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACHES},

Abstract = {In Russia, fiction in the genre of alternative history has become
   popular over the past ten years. Book series of this kind are actively
   published and have a significant readership. This genre is part of
   ideological and utopian landscape of the Russian mass consciousness. It
   helps to understand imperial historical traumas, nostalgia for the
   Soviet past, and a high level of anxiety about the present and future.
   The theoretical part of the analysis is based on the G. Rosenfeld ideas
   about a close connection of this genre with the experience of the
   present and about ontological pluralization of the past. The article
   also includes M. Laruelle's thesis about the ideological function of
   this genre and its role in ideological mobilization. The concept of E.
   Shatsky's utopia as a chronic escapism is an important element in the
   analysis of this genre in Russia. Russian science fiction in the genre
   of alternative history mirrors ideological and utopian unconscious,
   which articulates affective historical traumas of society. Alternative
   history novels actively experiment with genres, and it contains elements
   of a political detective story, adventure and spy novel, conspiracy
   theories, personal nostalgic memoirs about childhood and adolescence,
   mysticism, military action movie, romance, crypto- fiction. Many authors
   perceive their novels as a historical experiment, and they are concerned
   with problematizing the causes of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The
   modern Russian wave of science fiction in the genre of alternative
   history is a more painful reaction of a part of society to the deep
   historical faults associated with the collapse of the USSR. The source
   of the analysis is the materials of interviews with the authors of works
   in the genre of alternative history, readers' reviews on thematic online
   platforms and the content of the works.},

Title = {Antecedents and Consequences of Misinformation Sharing Behavior among
   Adults on Social Media during COVID-19},
Journal = {SAGE OPEN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Misinformation has been existed for centuries, though emerge as a severe
   concern in the age of social media, and particularly during COVID-19
   global pandemic. As the pandemic approached, a massive influx of mixed
   quality data appeared on social media, which had adverse effects on
   society. This study highlights the possible factors contributing to the
   sharing and spreading misinformation through social media during the
   crisis. Preferred Reporting Items and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used
   for systematic review. Anxiety or risk perception associated with
   COVID-19 was one of the significant motivators for misinformation
   sharing, followed by entertainment, information seeking, sociability,
   social tie strength, self-promotion, trust in science, self-efficacy,
   and altruism. WhatsApp and Facebook were the most used platforms for
   spreading rumors and misinformation. The results indicated five
   significant factors associated with COVID-19 misinformation sharing on
   social media, including socio-demographic characteristics, financial
   considerations, political affiliation or interest, conspiracy ideation,
   and religious factors. Misinformation sharing could have profound
   consequences for individual and society and impeding the efforts of
   government and health institutions to manage the crisis. This SLR
   focuses solely on quantitative studies, hence, studies are overlooked
   from a qualitative standpoint. Furthermore, this study only looked at
   the predictors of misinformation sharing behavior during COVID-19. It
   did not look into the factors that could curb the sharing of
   misinformation on social media platforms as a whole. The study's
   findings will help the public, in general, to be cautious about sharing
   misinformation, and the health care workers, and institutions, in
   particular, for devising strategies and measures to reduce the flow of
   misinformation by releasing credible information through concerned
   official social media accounts. The findings will be valuable for health
   professionals and government agencies to devise strategies for handling
   misinformation during public health emergencies.},

Title = {COVID vaccine stigma: detecting stigma across social media platforms

Abstract = {The study presents the first computational model of COVID vaccine stigma
   that can identify stigmatised sentiment with a high level of accuracy
   and generalises well across a number of social media platforms. The aim
   of the study is to understand the lexical features that are prevalent in
   COVID vaccine discourse and disputes between anti-vaccine and
   pro-vaccine groups. This should provide better insight for healthcare
   authorities, enabling them to better navigate those discussions. The
   study collected posts and their comments related to COVID vaccine
   sentiment in English, from Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube, for the period
   from April 2020 to March 2021. The labels used in the model, ``stigma
   ``, ``not stigma ``, and ``undefined ``, were collected from a smaller
   Facebook (Meta) dataset and successfully propagated into a larger
   dataset from Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube. The success of the
   propagation task and consequent classification is a result of
   state-of-the-art annotation scheme and annotated dataset. Deep learning
   and pre-trained word vector embedding significantly outperformed
   traditional algorithms, according to two-tailed P(T \& LE;t) test and
   achieved F1 score of 0.794 on the classification task with three
   classes. Stigmatised text in COVID anti-vaccine discourse is
   characterised by high levels of subjectivity, negative sentiment,
   anxiety, anger, risk, and healthcare references. After the first half of
   2020, anti-vaccination stigma sentiment appears often in comments to
   posts attempting to disprove COVID vaccine conspiracy theories. This is
   inconsonant with previous research findings, where anti-vaccine people
   stayed primarily within their own in-group discussions. This shift in
   the behaviour of the anti-vaccine movement from affirming climates to
   ones with opposing opinions will be discussed and elaborated further in
   the study.},

Title = {When Peppa Pig and Confucius meet, joining forces on the battlefield of
   health literacy-a qualitative analysis of COVID-19 educational materials
   for children and adolescents from China, the USA, and Europe},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {In times of pandemic, health literacy (HL) is very important, as it
   helps to find, understand, and use essential health information and
   services. According to WHO, HL is pivotal in fighting infodemic
   effectively, and education is a vital tool for developing it. In the
   presented work, we analyze 247 educational materials dedicated to
   children, adolescents, and their carers explaining the pandemic,
   prepared by the Chinese, American, German, Italian and Polish
   governments and international non-governmental organizations. Focusing
   on the textual and visual side of the documents, we investigated how the
   pandemic is explained and what discursive measures were used to inform
   young citizens about the risks and consequences of pandemic
   restrictions. Additionally, we verified whether the materials helped
   developing critical thinking, which is crucial to prevent spreading fake
   news and conspiracy theories. Although the analyzed materials were
   prepared in different cultural contexts, we identified that all of them
   contained simple instructions on the desired behaviours during the
   pandemic. Key messages relating to the importance of hygienic behaviors
   were often supplemented with guidelines on how to successfully complete
   each action. While the cultural particularities in presenting the state
   of the pandemic are visible, the challenges of dealing with the
   emotional and social crises were dominant all around the world. In our
   study, we argue that the possibilities of building HL were not fully
   exploited by the national and international institutions. Citizens were
   taught how to behave in unusual circumstances but not why they should
   behave differently. The educational materials lacked reliable knowledge
   that would allow them to deal with infodemic and develop critical
   thinking. We conclude that health education expertise worldwide should
   be focused on enhancing individuals' ability to make informed health
   decisions and provide three recommendations regarding the process of
   development of health educational resources for children and the youth.},

Title = {Comparing covariation among vaccine hesitancy and broader beliefs within
   Twitter and survey data},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, the percentage of adults in the United States who
   use some form of social media has roughly doubled, increasing from 36
   percent in early 2009 to 72 percent in 2019. There has been a
   corresponding increase in research aimed at understanding opinions and
   beliefs that are expressed online. However, the generalizability of
   findings from social media research is a subject of ongoing debate.
   Social media platforms are conduits of both information and
   misinformation about vaccines and vaccine hesitancy. Our research
   objective was to examine whether we can draw similar conclusions from
   Twitter and national survey data about the relationship between vaccine
   hesitancy and a broader set of beliefs. In 2018 we conducted a
   nationally representative survey of parents in the United States
   informed by a literature review to ask their views on a range of topics,
   including vaccine side effects, conspiracy theories, and understanding
   of science. We developed a set of keyword-based queries corresponding to
   each of the belief items from the survey and pulled matching tweets from
   2017. We performed the data pull of the most recent full year of data in
   2018. Our primary measures of belief covariation were the loadings and
   scores of the first principal components obtained using principal
   component analysis (PCA) from the two sources. We found that, after
   using manually coded weblinks in tweets to infer stance, there was good
   qualitative agreement between the first principal component loadings and
   scores using survey and Twitter data. This held true after we took the
   additional processing step of resampling the Twitter data based on the
   number of topics that an individual tweeted about, as a means of
   correcting for differential representation for elicited (survey) vs.
   volunteered (Twitter) beliefs. Overall, the results show that analyses
   using Twitter data may be generalizable in certain contexts, such as
   assessing belief covariation.},

Title = {Systematic study of background cosmology in unitary Poincare gauge
   theories with application to emergent dark radiation and
   <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> tension},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW D},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {102},

Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {We propose a one-parameter extension to Lambda CDM, expected to strongly
   affect cosmological tensions. An effective dark radiation component in
   the early Universe redshifts away as hot dark matter, then quintessence,
   tracking the dominant equation-of-state parameter and leaving a
   falsifiable torsion field in the current epoch. This picture results
   from a new Poincare gauge theory (PGT), one of the most promising among
   the latest batch of 58 PGTs found to be both power-counting
   renormalizable and free from ghosts and tachyons. We systematically
   categorize the cosmologies of 33 of these PGTs, as special cases of the
   most general parity-preserving, Ostrogradsky-stable PGT with a purely
   Yang-Mills action. The theory we consider contains two propagating
   massless gravitons, which may be J(P) = 2(+) (long-range gravitation and
   gravitational waves). A conspiracy among the coupling constants
   eliminates the spatial curvature k is an element of \{+/- 1, 0\} from
   the field equations. We show that this ``k-screening{''} is not
   restricted to conformal gravity theories. The flat Friedmann equations
   are then emergent, with potentially tension-resolving freedom at the
   early scale-invariant epoch that reliably gives way to an attractorlike
   state of modern Lambda CDM evolution. We compare with related theories
   and promising special cases, such as k-screened theories with
   negative-definite effective k, and more traditional theories with
   effective. and a J(P) = 0(-) massive graviton (dark matter candidate).
   As a bonus, we analyze similarly constrained actions in the new extended
   Weyl gauge theory (eWGT). We show that in cosmology, PGT and eWGT span
   exactly the same classical phenomenology up to a linear map between
   their coupling constants, hinting at a deeper relationship between the
   two.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research is devoted to the criminological description
   and explanation of the state of illegal influence on the results of
   official sports competitions in Ukraine. Main content. An ultra-high
   level of latency of crimes according to Art. 369-3 of the Criminal Code
   of Ukraine is found, which is at least 99\% of their actual level. The
   structure of match-fixing was revealed and analyzed depending on the
   type of sport, the method of illegal influence on the results of
   official sports competitions, as well as the subjects of bribery. The
   characteristic of the corresponding structural units is given.
   Methodology: Materials and methods research based on the analysis of
   documentary sources. the basis is the dialectical method of cognition of
   the facts of social reality, on which the formal legal and comparative
   legal approaches are largely based. Conclusions. The most intense
   criminal match-fixing is practiced in such kinds of sports as football,
   futsal, basketball and volleyball. Among the ways to encourage athletes
   to commit illegal acts, bribery predominates (75\%). Approximately at
   the same level in terms of prevalence with small fluctuations in
   specific weight are structurally located such ways of influencing
   athletes as incitement (10\%), conspiracy (8\%) and coercion ( 7\%). In
   general, illegal influence on the results of official sports
   competitions on bribery is directed directly at athletes. In total, the
   share of such influence is 78\% with a slight predominance of bribery of
   several athletes (players) of one team (40\%) over bribery of an
   individual player (38\%). In second place in terms of ranking - bribery
   of members of the coaching staff (10\%). Then bribery of judges (5\%),
   owners of sports clubs (5\%), support staff of clubs (2\%).},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic produced threats not only to physical and
   psychological health but also to the very fabric of family, work and
   social life. Individuals differ markedly in their ability to cope with
   such threats. Drawing on Identity Process Theory, our study examines
   identity processes that shape emotional and attitudinal responses to
   COVID-19. Survey data were collected from 251 adults in the UK during
   July 2020. Identity resilience, trust in science and scientists, fear of
   COVID-19 and perceived own risk of infection were measured. Respondents
   then watched a video clip designed to focus their thinking further upon
   the disease. Immediately after, levels of feeling afraid, uncertainty
   about self-protection, mistrust of anyone offering COVID-19 advice, and
   perceptions of identity change were indexed. A structural equation model
   of the relationship between these variables was tested and proved a good
   fit for the data. Identity resilience is negatively related to fear of
   COVID-19, which in turn is positively related to perceived own risk of
   COVID-19. Higher identity resilience is associated with greater
   uncertainty and feeling more afraid. Greater identity change is
   associated with higher mistrust, uncertainty and feeling more afraid.
   Trust in science and scientists correlates positively with perceived own
   risk of COVID-19 and negatively with mistrust of those offering advice
   on preventive behaviour. This study shows the usefulness of the identity
   resilience concept in modelling responses to health hazards. It also
   illustrates that focusing, even for a short time, on the characteristics
   of such a hazard can elicit perceived identity changes. Arousing fear is
   unlikely to initiate self-protection in those who are already fearful or
   who have less identity resilience. Fostering greater general trust in
   science and scientists, though difficult, will be valuable, particularly
   in encouraging public acceptance of mass vaccination against the virus
   when misinformation and conspiracy theories about it abound.},

Abstract = {By the end of March 1917, 20 out of 65 members of the Romanov Imperial
   House gathered on the estates Ai-Todor, Diul'ber, and Chair near Yalta
   in the Crimea. There were among them: a widow of Alexander III Maria
   Fedorovna; sisters of Nicholas II Xenia and Olga; Grand Dukes Nicholas
   Nikolaevich, Alexander Mikhailovich, Peter Nikolaevich. On April 26,
   1917, representatives of the Sevastopol Soviet, with the support of the
   forces of the Black Sea Fleet, conducted massive searches in the places
   of residence of the relatives of the former tsar in order to identify a
   possible counter-revolutionary conspiracy. On the basis of the published
   sources, as well as previously unused materials from the Russian State
   Archive of the Navy, including inspection protocols, the article
   reconstructs the circumstances of this only search of the Romanovs in
   the Crimea. The names of the main participants in the events are
   restored, the key role of Lieutenant Colonel A. I. Verkhovsky is
   described, who at that time was a deputy chairman of the Sevastopol
   Soviet. A. I. Verkhovsky has been underestimated until now as a
   participant in the revolutionary events in Russia between the February
   and October revolutions. At the end of August 1917, he became the last
   Minister of War of the Russian Empire in the rank of Major General. The
   search in estates on the southern coast ended with the Sevastopol City
   Council taking charge of the protection of the ``Crimean group of the
   Romanovs{''}. Afterwards, despite the fact that the Red Terror did not
   bypass the Crimean peninsula, Sevastopol sailors and representatives of
   local Councils helped save the lives of the relatives of the former tsar
   who ended up in the Crimea. All of them emigrated in 1919.},

Title = {The Ecosystem of Learning: Admission and Diversity in Christian Higher
   Education},
Journal = {CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Pages = {358-375},
Abstract = {The policies, priorities, and productivity of postsecondary admission
   offices are under a great deal of scrutiny. The current realities range
   from the pressures of tuition-driven institutions to deliver the
   majority of the university budget each fall, to more selective
   institutions wrestling with standards of which applicants to accept amid
   national scandals such as the well-publicized ``varsity blues{''} (a
   conspiracy to influence admission decisions at several top U.S.
   universities that was uncovered in 2019). Historically, institutional
   guidelines related to the admission and rejection of applicants have
   maintained a tense relationship with issues related to homogeneity and
   diversity. Postsecondary institutions in the U.S. were originally
   developed for the purpose of educating wealthy White men and slowly
   expanded to include more groups, in principle, even if not manifested in
   actual enrollment composition. Notably, efforts to diversify have
   repeatedly put admissions issues back in the spotlight of the U.S.
   Supreme Court. This article identifies and describes the process of
   admission to institutions of Christian higher education as one of the
   earliest points of contact for creating a learning environment. By
   taking an ecosystem approach akin to the metaphor of the body in I
   Corinthians 12, we examine the benefits of diversity in a manner that
   recognizes the ways in which all parts of the body can benefit, when all
   parts of the system are considered and included. Conversely,
   monocultures can miss the benefits of diversity, a reality that should
   be considered given that the process of shaping a class is often under
   the purview of admission and recruitment personnel. Beyond the more
   typical concerns related to the budget or prestige of an institution,
   shaping the class is critical to the process of creating a diverse
   learning environment that also provides multifaceted opportunities for
   cultivating spiritual growth.},

Title = {EVOLUTION OF THE CONCEPT OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION IN WESTERN AND RUSSIAN
   POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LAW},
Journal = {RUSSIAN LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {53-80},
Abstract = {As a result of intensive international debate and the adoption of a
   number of renowned international anticorruption conventions and
   initiatives in the 1990s and 2000s, the issue of corruption has become a
   convenient theme for different kinds of generalizations in social
   sciences. However, national legislation does not reflect these
   developments in its legal regulation due to conservatism inherent in
   jurisprudence.
   One of the most evident gaps in this respect is the sphere of political
   corruption. While political science and political economy for decades
   have been successful in explaining political processes in different
   countries as corrupt conspiracies of political elites, business
   structures, and other actors in the political process, legal science has
   kept itself separate from such problems and prefers to deal with
   individual acts of corruption. But if for criminal law such an approach
   seems logical due to the methodology of the criminal law, for other
   branches of law which set forth a systemic view on social processes -
   primarily administrative and constitutional - there seems to be an
   omission.
   Nowadays, there is a quite favourable environment for the development of
   a consistent legal understanding of anticorruption in Russia. This has
   become possible thanks to current Russian administrative reforms, when
   the need fora highly professional bureaucracy led to a greater demand
   for various anticorruption mechanisms. The next possible step in Russia
   may be an attempt to ensure the effectiveness of well-proven
   anti-corruption methods of the political system as a whole.
   In this article we propose a brief background to the evolution of the
   concept of political corruption in Western and Russian political and
   legal science, which entails the necessity of complex scientific legal
   synthesis on this issue, allows to discuss the existing methodological
   potential and creates new opportunities to build up appropriate systemic
   legislative models.},

Abstract = {Both law and history have played important roles in consolidating the
   identity of the modem nation-state, Although each discipline relies on
   similar fact-finding techniques, the two fields diverged as historians
   pursued grand narratives and legal scholars sought a rationalized and
   perfected system of laws. Today, the intellectual traditions in each
   field are being challenged by feminists, Critical Race Theorists, and
   new historicists. Whether lawyers or historians, critical scholars have
   questioned lofty abstractions that obscure the concrete, particular
   stories of the oppressed and forgotten. These convergent calls to listen
   to those who speak in a different voice provide an opportunity to bridge
   the gap between law and history by exploring the role of counterhistory
   in law. Drawing on insurgent intellectual movements, this Article
   defines counterhistory as an account that preserves the speaker's
   authenticity and agency, offers an alternative conception of imagined
   community, and reaches a substantial audience. The Article explores two
   criminal trials, each of which might qualify as counterhistory. One is
   the famous trial of the abolitionist John Brown for murder, treason, and
   conspiracy to incite a slave insurrection in Virginia. The other is the
   far less well-known case of Ed Johnson, a Black man who was probably
   wrongly accused of rape and then lynched when his attorneys sought U.S.
   Supreme Court review of his conviction. Although both trials contributed
   in significant ways to the pursuit of racial justice and equality, the
   proceedings against John Brown arguably are a better example of
   counterhistory than those against Ed Johnson. The Article closes by
   examining some contemporary obstacles to telling counterhistory in the
   courtroom, particularly the rise of a complex, bureaucratized trial
   process and television's appropriation of legal stories as a form of
   mass entertainment.},

Abstract = {We present a basic family of galactic disk evolutionary models bearing
   in mind three fundamental questions: i) to what extent does the present
   cosmological frame offer the natural initial conditions for galactic
   formation and evolution, ii) what is the relevance of gas hydrodynamics
   in determining the present physical conditions of disk galaxies and iii)
   how does the wide variety of star formation (SF) histories displayed by
   late type galaxies find an explanation within the present frame of
   galactic evolution. These models describe the global evolution of a disk
   galaxy by integrating the physics of previously published local models
   (Firmani and Tutukov 1992, 1994 hereafter FT1 and FT2) into a
   hydrodynamical framework dominated by gas turbulent dissipation. In an
   effort to avoid ad hoc assumptions we introduce a physical approach to
   the study of the gas and star disks which provides a reasonable estimate
   of the turbulent viscosity and energy dissipation of gas as well as of
   the SF rate (SFR). This approach offers the advantage of leading to
   models free of arbitrary parameters, the evolution of which depends on
   the initial conditions concerning gas and dark matter and on gas
   accretion. The initial conditions where introduced in consistency with a
   cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology with a scale invariant fluctuation
   spectrum normalized to COBE. Our results show that for models
   representative of the Galaxy a very effective gas transfer due to the
   turbulent viscosity takes place independent of accretion regime. This
   process leads to a radial exponential decay of the final stellar surface
   density and a flat rotation curve, in accord with a `'conspiracy''
   behind an indistinguishable transition between visible and dark matter
   contributions. A star formation rate consistent with a surface Schmidt's
   law with a power smaller than or equal to two is also obtained.},

Abstract = {Objective Understanding public discourse on emergency use of unproven
   therapeutics is essential to monitor safe use and combat misinformation.
   We developed a natural language processing-based pipeline to understand
   public perceptions of and stances on coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19)-related drugs on Twitter across time.
   Methods This retrospective study included 609 189 US-based tweets
   between January 29, 2020 and November 30, 2021 on 4 drugs that gained
   wide public attention during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1)
   Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin, drug therapies with anecdotal
   evidence; and (2) Molnupiravir and Remdesivir, FDA-approved treatment
   options for eligible patients. Time-trend analysis was used to
   understand the popularity and related events. Content and demographic
   analyses were conducted to explore potential rationales of people's
   stances on each drug.
   Results Time-trend analysis revealed that Hydroxychloroquine and
   Ivermectin received much more discussion than Molnupiravir and
   Remdesivir, particularly during COVID-19 surges. Hydroxychloroquine and
   Ivermectin were highly politicized, related to conspiracy theories,
   hearsay, celebrity effects, etc. The distribution of stance between the
   2 major US political parties was significantly different (P < .001);
   Republicans were much more likely to support Hydroxychloroquine (+55\%)
   and Ivermectin (+30\%) than Democrats. People with healthcare
   backgrounds tended to oppose Hydroxychloroquine (+7\%) more than the
   general population; in contrast, the general population was more likely
   to support Ivermectin (+14\%).
   Conclusion Our study found that social media users with have different
   perceptions and stances on off-label versus FDA-authorized drug use
   across different stages of COVID-19, indicating that health systems,
   regulatory agencies, and policymakers should design tailored strategies
   to monitor and reduce misinformation for promoting safe drug use. Our
   analysis pipeline and stance detection models are made public at

Abstract = {The Israeli series Prisoners of War (Hatufim, Keshet, Israel, Gideon
   Raff, 2009-2011) and Homeland (Showtime, US 2011-2013; developed by
   Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa based on the Israeli series with Gideon
   Raff as one of the producers) is a special case of hypertextuality
   (Genette 1982). Both serial dramas revolve around prisoners of war who
   have returned home and their families, intelligence agency operatives
   and terror organizations operating behind the scenes. In these
   serializations of the thriller genre, narratives of paranoia and
   conspiracy render invisible terror visible on the screen. The
   focalization of the various plots and sub-plots as well as their
   reception spaces are different however. Prisoners of War tells the story
   of three soldierswho are kidnapped, held captive for 17 years and suffer
   from post-traumatic stress disorder on their return home. The series was
   broadcast at a time when intensive negotiations were underway for the
   release of three IDF soldiers who had been kidnapped. Homeland, on the
   other hand, places centre stage a female CIA operative (Claire Danes)
   who suffers from bipolar disorder. The first season was broadcast in
   post-9/11 America while American soldiers were still fighting in Iraq.
   Both series therefore directly address their audiences and relate to the
   public sphere outside the studio. The reception of these texts
   incorporates their meaning as reconstructed by their publics. Thus,
   while both series involve a ritual of scapegoating as a means of
   resolving conflict, each reflects and produces its own repertoire of
   reality (realemes'). Interestingly, a traumatic excess is inscribed on
   both male and female bodies as each series rewrites its own society's
   myth: the binding of Isaac in the Israeli Prisoners of War and Joan of
   Arc in the American Homeland.},

Abstract = {In medieval times, Christians on the Iberian peninsula fought wars to
   expel Muslim rulers from Europe. This protracted conflict, known as the
   Reconquista, was concluded in 1492 when the last of the Muslim rulers
   surrendered. Less than a hundred years later, in 1565, the Spanish
   Empire's conquering impulse had carried it across two oceans into
   Southeast Asia, where Christian Spaniards, once again, confronted and
   fought against Islam. Though there are distinct differences between
   these two Christian-Muslim conflicts, there are also important
   similarities. As the Reconquista had done in Spain, Christian-Muslim
   conflicts in the Philippines known as the Moro Wars shaped local
   perceptions of Islam, established political and cultural boundaries, and
   attached personal loyalties to one or the other of these two global
   religions. This paper analyzes this process by focusing on two Christian
   conquests of Moros. The first of these was the conquest of Manila. When
   the Spanish arrived, Manila was a developing Moro settlement with ties
   to Islamic rulers on Borneo, Mindanao, and Job. Over several decades the
   Spanish gradually coopted Moro authority in Manila, and then finally
   expelled it through the prosecution of several conspirators involved in
   the Tondo conspiracy. This conquest established the political and
   cultural center of the colony and its emerging multiethnic colonial
   community. The second conquest happened on Mindanao. Unlike the conquest
   of Manila, the conquest of Mindanao was never completed. Though the
   Spanish colony won several battles, Moro authority continued to thrive
   in the region. By focusing on the triumphal entry of a Spanish army
   following one of these victories, this paper shows how the constant
   Christian-Muslim conflict reaffirmed and gave personal meaning to the
   boundaries separating the Moros and the Christians in the archipelago.
   Together these two different conquests demonstrate how the revival of
   the Reconquista contributed to the creation of the Philippine colony.},

Title = {Can Communication Strategies Combat COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy with
   Trade-Off between Public Service Messages and Public Skepticism?
   Experimental Evidence from Pakistan},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic may have reached a turning point as the World
   Health Organization and the global community of nations step up plans
   for mass vaccination campaigns. However, the COVID-19 vaccine-related
   conspiracy theories (e.g., falsehoods about birth control, women
   infertility, surveillance, and microchip humanity, etc.) have built new
   momentum for vaccine hesitancy. To this end, several nations worldwide,
   including Pakistan, are struggling to boost public trust and enthusiasm
   to get vaccinated, especially in an anxious and complicated atmosphere
   propelled by multiple, new and the deadliest variants of COVID-19. To
   address this critical research gap during these intensifying conditions
   of vaccine hesitancy, the present study makes the first attempt to
   explore the potential effects of various communication strategies,
   including public service message (safety benefits versus fear
   appraisals), media types (i.e., traditional versus digital),
   self-efficacy, perceived benefits and threats (susceptibility and
   severity), on the willingness to get vaccinated for COVID-19.
   Importantly, the underlying effects of public skepticism (in a
   moderating role) on these relationships were empirically examined. Using
   four fictitious COVID-19 immunization campaigns in a series of
   experiments with 2 (media type: traditional vs. digital) X 2 (service
   attribute: health and safety benefits vs. fear) message frames
   (represented as Group one to Group four), the findings identified fear
   appraisal as the most viable communication strategy in combating vaccine
   hesitancy. Moreover, public skepticism negatively moderated the effects
   of media types and public service message attributes on willingness to
   get vaccinated in relatively high (i.e., Group two), moderate (i.e.,
   Group one and four), and low intensities (i.e., Group three). The
   pioneering findings of this research offer new strategic insights for
   the global health authorities and vaccine promoters to proactively
   address the downward spiral of people's willingness to take the COVID-19
   vaccine.},

Abstract = {Engagement with scientific manuscripts is frequently facilitated by
   Twitter and other social media platforms. As such, the demographics of a
   paper's social media audience provide a wealth of information about how
   scholarly research is transmitted, consumed, and interpreted by online
   communities. By paying attention to public perceptions of their
   publications, scientists can learn whether their research is stimulating
   positive scholarly and public thought. They can also become aware of
   potentially negative patterns of interest from groups that misinterpret
   their work in harmful ways, either willfully or unintentionally, and
   devise strategies for altering their messaging to mitigate these
   impacts. In this study, we collected 331,696 Twitter posts referencing
   1,800 highly tweeted bioRxiv preprints and leveraged topic modeling to
   infer the characteristics of various communities engaging with each
   preprint on Twitter. We agnostically learned the characteristics of
   these audience sectors from keywords each user's followers provide in
   their Twitter biographies. We estimate that 96\% of the preprints
   analyzed are dominated by academic audiences on Twitter, suggesting that
   social media attention does not always correspond to greater public
   exposure. We further demonstrate how our audience segmentation method
   can quantify the level of interest from nonspecialist audience sectors
   such as mental health advocates, dog lovers, video game developers,
   vegans, bitcoin investors, conspiracy theorists, journalists, religious
   groups, and political constituencies. Surprisingly, we also found that
   10\% of the preprints analyzed have sizable (>5\%) audience sectors that
   are associated with right-wing white nationalist communities. Although
   none of these preprints appear to intentionally espouse any right-wing
   extremist messages, cases exist in which extremist appropriation
   comprises more than 50\% of the tweets referencing a given preprint.
   These results present unique opportunities for improving and
   contextualizing the public discourse surrounding scientific research.},

Title = {The financial institution as a racketeering enterprise: RICO and beyond},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {125-131},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce the reader to
   Section 901(a) of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, which deals
   with ``Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations{''} and is
   popularly known as the ``RICO{''} statute.
   Design/methodology/approach - RICO was designed to protect legitimate
   enterprises from infiltration by organized crime. The paper discusses
   one case in which a bank, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
   (BCCI), was found to have violated RICO by engaging in prohibited
   racketeering activities and a second case in which another bank, UBS AG,
   engaged in activities criminal under US law. The paper then details some
   of the activities of the two banks and explores the remedies available
   under RICO.
   Findings - Following the failure of BCCI, the US filed a criminal
   information against the bank that included a forfeiture allegation under
   Section 1963 of RICO. In February of 2009, UBS AG, Switzerland's largest
   bank, entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the US
   Department of Justice, under the terms of which the bank agreed to waive
   indictment and consented to the filing of an information charging the
   bank with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the USA and its
   agency, the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of 18 USC 371.
   Originality/value - BCCI may be something of an extreme case in terms of
   the breadth and scope of the illegal activities in which it engaged.
   But, it is not the only example of a bank gone wrong. Unfortunately,
   abuses can and do continue, although not every case may end with RICO
   forfeiture. Indeed, in a recent case with faint echoes of BCCI, RICO did
   not come into play at all.},

Journal = {TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR GESCHIEDENIS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {120},
Number = {3},
Pages = {304+},
Abstract = {When colonel Claus von Stauffenberg was executed, directly after the
   failure of his attempt on 20 July 1944 to kill Hitler and to start a
   coup d'etat, he could expect to appear in German history as a traitor
   and perjurer. The fact that he is generally celebrated as a hero in this
   year's centenary, was not a self-evident result. For the German war
   generation this action was at least morally unacceptable if not high
   treason; for the Allies and for many historians afterwards he and his
   accomplices only tried to liquidate Hitler because he lost the war. It
   was the old military Prussian clique, wishing to save its skin.
   To really understand Stauffenberg, this article deals with the exclusive
   world of the poet Stefan George and his elitist circle. George was
   inspired by two great myths: classicist Hellas and the universal sacred
   Empire. To prepare for the future a sort of synthesis of these myths was
   the elevated mission of `Secret Germany' a cultural elite, radically
   opposed to the real existing German state. As adolescents, Stauffenberg
   and his brothers were deeply impressed and influenced by George. Besides
   it was his inherited consciousness of responsibility for the state and
   Germany that drove him into the conspiracy after a period of ambivalence
   with respect to Hitler's politics. At last he decided for action to end
   the murderous crimes in the East, because the war was lost and a near
   peace of compromise became impossible. Recent research confirms that he
   indeed was the dominant and inspiring man of the Putsch and the only one
   who did not despair until the end. This article stresses the importance
   of the myth and of the poetic word as inspiration for his decision.},

Title = {Factors associated with COVID-19 booster vaccine hesitancy: a
   nationwide, cross-sectional survey in Japan},
Journal = {PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {223},
Pages = {72-79},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objectives: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy/fatigue is increasing as the
   pandemic enters the endemic phase. The present study aimed to explore
   current perceptions about COVID-19 booster vaccination among the
   Japanese public. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the Japan COVID-19
   and Society Internet Survey conducted in September 2021 and September
   2022. The public's perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination and factors
   associated with COVID-19 booster vaccine hesitancy were analyzed.
   Results: In total, 56,735 respondents were included. In the Japan
   COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey 2021, 75.1\% of the participants
   (21,126/28,118) had completed the primary vaccination series. In the
   2022 survey, 74.1\% of the respondents (21,216/28,617) completed the
   primary series of vaccination with booster doses. The proportion of fear
   toward COVID-19 and obtaining information about COVID-19 has decreased
   from 2021 to 2022. Factors independently associated with booster vaccine
   hesitancy were young age (range: 18-29 years; adjusted odds ratio
   {[}aOR]: 6.56), history of COVID-19 (aOR: 1.82), distrust of the
   Japanese government's COVID-19 prevention measures (aOR: 1.55), lack of
   confidence in COVID-19 vaccine efficacy (aOR: 1.30), lack of confidence
   in COVID-19 vaccine safety (aOR: 1.62), low reliance on the COVID-19
   vaccine (aOR: 1.92), and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories (aOR:
   1.77). Conclusions: Providing clear and trustworthy information is
   critically important, especially targeted and tailored messages for the
   young generation, to promoting COVID-19 booster vaccination.
   Policymakers should therefore develop consistent and transparent
   communication strategies and the ability to respond promptly and
   flexibly to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on the public while
   preparing for the next pandemic. (c) 2023 The Royal Society for Public

Title = {Using Twitter data to understand public perceptions of approved versus
   off-label use for COVID-19-related medications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 18},
Abstract = {Objective: Understanding public discourse on emergency use of unproven
   therapeutics is essential to monitor safe use and combat misinformation.
   We developed a natural language processing-based pipeline to understand
   public perceptions of and stances on coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19)-related drugs on Twitter across time.
   Methods: This retrospective study included 609 189 US-based tweets
   between January 29, 2020 and November 30, 2021 on 4 drugs that gained
   wide public attention during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1)
   Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin, drug therapies with anecdotal
   evidence; and (2) Molnupiravir and Remdesivir, FDA-approved treatment
   options for eligible patients. Time-trend analysis was used to
   understand the popularity and related events. Content and demographic
   analyses were conducted to explore potential rationales of people's
   stances on each drug.
   Results: Time-trend analysis revealed that Hydroxychloroquine and
   Ivermectin received much more discussion than Molnupiravir and
   Remdesivir, particularly during COVID-19 surges. Hydroxychloroquine and
   Ivermectin were highly politicized, related to conspiracy theories,
   hearsay, celebrity effects, etc. The distribution of stance between the
   2 major US political parties was significantly different (P< .001);
   Republicans were much more likely to support Hydroxychloroquine (+55\%)
   and Ivermectin (+30\%) than Democrats. People with healthcare
   backgrounds tended to oppose Hydroxychloroquine (+7\%) more than the
   general population; in contrast, the general population was more likely
   to support Ivermectin (+14\%).
   Conclusion: Our study found that social media users with have different
   perceptions and stances on off-label versus FDA-authorized drug use
   across different stages of COVID-19, indicating that health systems,
   regulatory agencies, and policymakers should design tailored strategies
   to monitor and reduce misinformation for promoting safe drug use. Our
   analysis pipeline and stance detection models are made public at

Title = {Historical expertise of the tragedy on Pula's Vargarola
   (<i>Vergarolla</i>) on August 18th 1946},
Journal = {HISTRIA},

Abstract = {Even after 64 years, the mystery of the Vargarola explosion on August
   18th 1946, which left 63 dead and 30 people of Pula injured, most of
   them women, children and youth, has not been solved. Alongside the
   victims of the bombing of Pula on January 9th 1944, this is the gravest
   tragedy that had hit the city in the 20th century.
   Much has been written about this event, especially in the past 15 years.
   Publicists, some eyewitnesses, often those who did not even know where
   Vargarola is, wrote about it, but not a single historian did. Historians
   mentioned the event only as a cause or the reason for the exodus of the
   Italian citizens of Pula and copied incorrect data from Italian
   publicists. Texts were, of course, emotional and overburdened with
   various political beliefs. Important facts were left out or inverted and
   distorted as one please). The uncritical attitude towards this event
   encourages and nourishes all sorts of conspiracy theories and nonsense
   stories so it may seem as if the real truth does not want to come out.
   The truth can be found (or we can at least come close to it) if the
   event at Vargarola is studied in a broader context of events within the
   period from May 1945 until January 1947. Every archived document
   connected to the event needs to be studied and all technical information
   about the explosion need to be critically processed.
   Historically-professional expertise of the event is based on a critique
   of published publicist writings and scientific texts, newspapers of the
   time and archives. I would especially like to emphasize the value of the
   archives from The National Archives Kew Gardens fund which helped which
   helped our understanding of the unfamiliar events and processes
   connected to this tragedy.},

Abstract = {In 1821 Napoleon died in exile on the Island of St. Helena. Although the
   autopsy had suggested stomach cancer as the cause of death, in 1961 an
   elevated arsenic concentration was found in Napoleon's hair. This
   finding elicited numerous theories of conspiracy, treachery, and
   poisoning. Most recent reports even suggested inappropriate medical
   treatment may have contributed to the exiled Emperor's death.
   Napoleon's apparent obesity at the time of his demise was interpreted as
   a strong argument against stomach cancer as the cause of death; however,
   his weight changes over the course of his life, noticeable from the
   contemporary iconography, have not been systematically analyzed.
   To test the hypothesis that Napoleon's weight at death could be
   compatible with a diagnosis of terminal gastric cancer, we performed
   several studies to determine: a) Napoleon's weight at death; and b) the
   changes of his weight during the last 20 years of his life. Our weight
   modeling was based on the collection of 12 different pairs of trousers
   worn by Napoleon between 1800 and 1821, the year of his death. Modeling
   trouser sizes with control data suggested a weight increase from 67 kg
   to 90 kg by 1820. The trousers worn at the time of death suggested a
   Subsequent weight loss of 11 kg (to 79 kg) during the last year of his
   life. This weight was confirmed by a second modeling approach based on
   the subcutaneous fat measurement performed at autopsy (1.5 inches) and a
   control group of 270 men dying from various causes. This provides a
   reasonable validation for both weight measurement methods. Napoleon's
   terminal weight loss of more than 10 kg is suggestive of a severe
   progressive chronic illness and is highly consistent with a diagnosis of
   gastric cancer. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Cosmopolitan ethnicity, entrepreneurship and the nation: Minority elites
   in Botswana},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The build-up of inter-ethnic trust, partnerships and alliances by
   minority elites is a remarkable accomplishment, in the face of
   majoritarian fears of `the takeover' and `the hidden agenda' - the
   popular imagining of an ethnic conspiracy consciously directed by the
   few against the many. This article examines that inter-ethnic
   accomplishment and the entrepreneurship of nationally prominent Kalanga
   elites. Mainly former top civil servants turned entrepreneurs,
   originally from the north of Botswana, they are now the best-positioned
   minority elites in the capital in the south. The analysis resolves a
   linked set of apparent paradoxes. The first is that Kalanga elites merge
   urban cosmopolitanism with assertions of their ethnic identity,
   linguistic difference, distinct cultural heritage and ties to their
   rural homes. The second relates to the boundary-crossing legacies in the
   postcolonial present from the colonial and pre-colonial past: that
   Kalanga elites, coming from the borderland of Botswana and Zimbabwe,
   orient their ethnicity towards the nation and also beyond it,
   internationally. That super-tribalism and nation building in Botswana
   march ahead together, like moral comrades-in-arms, is the third paradox.
   More generally for postcolonial studies, the argument relates changes in
   ethnicity, inter-ethnicity and entrepreneurship to the transformation of
   the capable African state, tracing these changes through the
   administrations of Botswana's three presidents: from the heyday of
   assimilationist yet highly co-optive policy and One Nation Consensus
   under the first; through the second president's less co-optive rule,
   which appeared to foster the autonomy of the bureaucracy but, under a
   liberalisation policy, reduced the insulation between the civil service
   and the investment opportunities of business and high finance; and
   finally, under the current president, to the growing pressures for a
   shift towards greater pluralism in the postcolonial state.},

   However, rather than reifying the belief-driven pretensions
   traditionally upheld by religion, in this paper, I wish to propose a
   different outlook on spirituality, one which is linked to those
   inexplicable, visceral sensations engendered by German artist Katharina
   Grosse's explosive use of colour. To do this, I turn to the philosophy
   of Gilles Deleuze, who when affirming the non-representational,
   spiritual potencies inherent to art provides the conceptual means
   through which to address such relationship. Specifically, Deleuze places
   the emphasis on his concept of sensation, which speaks neither of
   subject nor object. Indeed, by apprehending those in-between, intensive
   moments in which a visual work of art stimulates our eyes, mind, and
   body, sensation foregrounds an immanent, and not transcendent,
   understanding of spirituality. This immanent understanding of
   spirituality refers to the pre-individual forces and processes from the
   outside through which sensation enables us to precursively experience
   what the spiritual looks and feels like, yet without enforcing a
   dogmatic pathway to follow. Thus, by combining my reflections on
   Deleuze's thinking on sensation with creative vignettes based on an
   online ethnographic study of Grosse's artworks, the paper presents three
   methodological pointers: (1) Confronting the in-betweenness of
   sensation, (2) Experimenting with the precursive force of language, and
   (3) Unleashing the literary power of becoming. Through them, I show how
   geographers might rethink their engagements with art as having more to
   do with an aesthetically induced, micro-subjective journey into their
   spiritual becoming than with an intentional encounter. I conclude the
   paper by discussing the ethico-political implications that endorsing an
   ethos of sensation might have for geography and beyond.},

Abstract = {The author analyzes the War in the Vende., one of the most important
   revolts of the time of the French Revolution, as it was perceived by the
   Republicans. Not only dozens of thousands of people were killed, but
   also the image of the world of the French changed. Soon after the revolt
   started, the Republicans already imagined a kind of `ideal revolt', able
   to destroy all the state. Other rebellions started to be measured with
   the same scale, and to be called ``New Vendee{''}. ``New Vendee{''} is a
   cultural and psychological phenomenon, a kind of cognitive matrix, which
   left its mark on the perception of reality by the Republicans and on the
   decisions they made. This was a complex structure of images, which grew
   from the war in the west of France, but later was implied to any
   rebellion in any part of the country. The main features of ``New
   Vendee{''} were the ideas of conspiracy, of the intervention of the
   foreign states into the inner affairs of France, and their aspiration to
   kindle a fire of revolt, the royalism of those who participated in the
   revolts. After all, the Republicans thought that the appearance of ``New
   Vendee{''} was due to the influence of the clergy. To the Republicans,
   the priests had to be stopped to prevent the spread of the rebellion.
   Because of such a perception, a peaceful resolution of the conflict
   became for the Republicans virtually impossible. As in the west, in all
   other parts of the country they suggested only to kill those who took
   part into the revolts. It was not important how big were the sins of the
   rebels, they all were judged with the scale of Vendee. There was no
   chance to a compromise: one could either submit, or await being killed.},

Title = {Exploring the vaccine conversation on TikTok in Italy: beyond classic

Abstract = {TikTok, a social media platform for creating and sharing short videos,
   has seen a surge in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. To analyse
   the Italian vaccine conversation on TikTok, we downloaded a sample of
   videos with a high play count (Top Videos), identified through an
   unofficial Application Programming Interface (consistent with TikTok's
   Terms of Service), and collected public videos from vaccine sceptic
   users through snowball sampling (Vaccine Sceptics' videos). The videos
   were analysed using qualitative and quantitative methods, in terms of
   vaccine stance, tone of voice, topic, conformity with TikTok style, and
   other characteristics. The final datasets consisted of 754 Top Videos
   (by 510 single users) plus 180 Vaccine Sceptics' videos (by 29 single
   users), posted between January 2020 and March 2021. In 40.5\% of the Top
   Videos the stance was promotional, 33.9\% were indefinite-ironic, 11.3\%
   were neutral, 9.7\% were discouraging, and 3.1\% were ambiguous (i.e.
   expressing an ambivalent stance towards vaccines); 43\% of promotional
   videos were from healthcare professionals. More than 95\% of the Vaccine
   Sceptic videos were discouraging. Multiple correspondence analysis
   showed that, compared to other stances, promotional videos were more
   frequently created by healthcare professionals and by females, and their
   most frequent topic was herd immunity. Discouraging videos were
   associated with a polemical tone of voice and their topics were
   conspiracy and freedom of choice. Our analysis shows that Italian
   vaccine-sceptic users on TikTok are limited in number and vocality, and
   the large proportion of videos with an indefinite-ironic stance might
   imply that the incidence of affective polarisation could be lower on
   TikTok, compared to other social media, in the Italian context. Safety
   is the most frequent concern of users, and we recorded an interesting
   presence of healthcare professionals among the creators. TikTok should
   be considered as a medium for vaccine communication and for vaccine
   promotion campaigns.},

Abstract = {Background A relentless flood of information accompanied the novel
   coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. False news, conspiracy theories,
   and magical cures were shared with the general public at an alarming
   rate, which may lead to increased anxiety and stress levels and
   associated debilitating consequences.
   Objectives To measure the level of COVID-19 information overload (COVIO)
   and assess the association between COVIO and sociodemographic
   characteristics among the general public.
   Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between April and
   May 2020 using a modified Cancer Information Overload scale. The survey
   was developed and posted on four social media platforms. The data were
   only collected from those who consented to participate. COVIO score was
   classified into high vs. low using the asymmetrical distribution as a
   guide and conducted a binary logistic regression to examine the factors
   associated with COVIO.
   Results A total number of 584 respondents participated in this study.
   The mean COVIO score of the respondents was 19.4 (+/- 4.0). Sources and
   frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were found to be significant
   predictors of COVIO. Participants who received information via the
   broadcast media were more likely to have high COVIO than those who
   received information via the social media (adjusted odds ratio
   ({[}aOR],14.599; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.608-132.559; p =
   0.017). Also, participants who received COVID-19 information every
   minute (aOR, 3.892; 95\% CI, 1.124-13.480; p = 0.032) were more likely
   to have high COVIO than those who received information every week.
   Conclusion The source of information and the frequency of receiving
   COVID-19 information were significantly associated with COVIO. The
   COVID-19 information is often conflicting, leading to confusion and
   overload of information in the general population. This can have
   unfavorable effects on the measures taken to control the transmission
   and management of COVID-19 infection.},

Abstract = {Introduction. A new source on the history of the Bulavin Uprising of
   1707-1709 is published: a report of the Azov Governor I.A. Tolstoy to
   the Ambassadorial Chancery of December 8, 1708, which is stored in the
   Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts. It was sent in response to a
   request for an order about the Gulyashiy Chelovek (Freeman Wanderer)
   Grigory Zaitsev, nicknamed Banshick (Bath Attendant), accused of aiding
   Kondraty Bulavin. Analysis. Despite the brevity of the presentation, the
   document is very informative. It contains information about the events
   that took place in Cherkassk and Azov in June 1708. New details are
   reported about the organization of the rebel-led campaign against Azov,
   about Ataman K.A. Bulavin's hopes for support from the Azov residents
   and soldiers, about the conspiracy against him in Cherkassk, etc. No
   less important is the data on how the preliminary investigation of state
   crimes (participation in a rebellion) was conducted at the Ambassadorial
   Chancery in the second half of 1708. On the example of the G.K.
   Zaitsev's case we see that the investigation, which started because of a
   denunciation, was carried out in accordance with the norms of procedural
   law adopted at that time and was accompanied by the collection of
   evidence. At the same time, the paper is a source of biographical
   information about the person under investigation, who unwittingly became
   an agent of the Cherkassk's conspirators and an informant of the Azov
   governor. Methods. The publication is prepared in accordance with the
   applicable rules of archaeography. Results. The published document
   allows us to verify some other sources introduced into scientific
   circulation earlier, and extends the knowledge available in science
   about the culmination of the Bulavin Uprising.},

Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},

Volume = {4},

Pages = {81-102},
Abstract = {While the transnational public sphere has existed in the Arendtian sense
   at least since the mid-19th century, a new kind of reflexively political
   global civil society emerged in the late 20th century. However,
   non-governmental organisations (NGOs), advocacy groups, and networks
   have limited agendas and legitimacy and, without the support of at least
   one state, limited means to realise changes. Since 2001, the World
   Social Forum (WSF) has formed a key attempt in forging links and tics of
   solidarity among diverse actors. Although the WSF may seem a party of
   opinion when defined negatively against neoliberal globalisation,
   imperialism, and violence, in more positive ideological terms it remains
   a rather incoherent collection of diverse actors; while itself defined
   as a mere open space. There is a quest for new forms of agency such as a
   world political party. Various historical predecessors of global
   political parties, real and imagined, provide conceptual resources,
   useful experiences for envisaging the structure, and function of a
   possible planetary party-formation. H.G. Wells's `open conspiracy' is a
   particularly important future-oriented left-democratic vision. Wells
   believed that only a mass movement of truly committed individuals and
   groups could have the power to transform the world political
   organisation, by creating a democratic world commonwealth. Recently, for
   instance, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have formulated similar ideas.
   I argue that transformative political agency presupposes a shared
   programme, based on common elements of a wider and deeper world-view,
   and willingness to engage in processes of collective will-formation in
   terms of democratic procedures. From this perspective, I outline a
   possible organisation and some substantial directions for a global
   political party. The point is also to respond to the criticism of
   existing parties and cultivate the critical-pluralist ethos of global
   civil society, but in terms of democratic party-formation.},

Title = {HONG-KONG CHANGING POLITICAL ORDER AND ITS RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to investigate how the changing political order of
   Hong Kong is shaped by the interactions of different political forces;
   namely mainland China, Britain, and the local political groups of Hong
   Kong. A review of how the evolving regional order and new international
   political order affects the future of Hong Kong shows that despite the
   possible setbacks caused to Hong Kong by her return to mainland China,
   regionalism (through Hong Kong's integration and leadership role in the
   South China Economic Zone) and internationalism (the
   internationalization of Hong Kong) can become positive factors to
   guarantee the future prosperity of Hong Kong. However, the.state's
   overwhelming control over the civil society in mainland China can be
   extended to Hong Kong through her participation and intervention in Hong
   Kong's activities. Businessmen are afraid that bureaucracy, corruption,
   and commercial crimes would increase as 1997 approaches. Instead of
   practicing the Western way of management (contract, rule by law, etc.),
   people in Hong Kong need to adopt the ``Chinese{''} ways in dealing with
   mainland China (such as kuan-hsi and corruption). The rivalry between
   London and Peking can be a source of instability also, as the latter is
   always worrying about the British ``conspiracies{''} of implementing a
   parliamentary system of government, privatizing some government
   organizations, and limiting the progress of localization.
   Situated between the two countries, local political forces in Hong Kong
   appear to be weak. Political groups formed by businessmen tend to live
   under the shadow of the Chinese Communist Party, while the leadership of
   the United Democrats would probably not be granted a place in the future
   political stage.
   The article finally touches upon Taiwan-Hong Kong relations.
   Reconciliation of the relationship between mainland China and Taiwan
   might be helpful in improving Taiwan's performance in Hong Kong.},

Title = {Health Misinformation on Social Media and its Impact on COVID-19 Vaccine
   Inoculation in Jordan},
Journal = {COMMUNICATION \& SOCIETY-SPAIN},

Abstract = {It is vital to understand the nature of misinformation disseminated
   online regarding the COVID-19 vaccination. This understanding will
   enhance governments' efforts and strategies to combat the factors which
   hinder vaccine uptake. Vaccine hesitancy has always been a challenge
   which has accompanied vaccine rollouts. Misinformation regarding the
   COVID-19 vaccination, along with the ambiguous narratives around the
   origin of the virus, has played a role in vaccine hesitancy among
   Jordanians. The online activity generated by social media during the
   pandemic, due to people's fear of the virus, their general anxiety and
   curiosity, and their desire for updates, made social media an even more
   fertile environment for misinformation than ever before. During the
   COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan, misinformation on social media platforms
   amplified the scale of fears around the safety of the vaccination
   programme. Therefore, this study offers an exploration of, and insight
   into, the thoughts and experiences of a sample of 30 Jordanian citizens
   who are hesitant about COVID-19 vaccination. This study uses a
   qualitative approach in order to further understand vaccine hesitancy
   and the nature of misinformation surrounding it, using semi-structured,
   face-to-face interviews with participants. It found that low levels of
   information about health, misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine, and
   the spread of misinformation on social media were all causes of vaccine
   hesitancy in Jordan. Facebook and WhatsApp were the principal social
   media networks identified in this study as spreading misinformation
   about the vaccine. The study sample reported that they believed in the
   conspiracy theories discussed on these two platforms. Furthermore,
   videos of influencers and anti -vaccination medical doctors from
   overseas played a part in misleading individuals regarding inoculation
   against COVID-19. Additionally, other factors were also identified and
   are discussed in this study.},

Abstract = {Vaccination is a critical tool in the global response to the COVID-19
   pandemic. Yet, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has not been well explored in
   parts of Nigeria. We assessed the predictors of acceptability of the
   COVID-19 vaccine and identified reasons for vaccine hesitancy among
   adults in urban Kano, northern Nigeria. Using a mixed-methods design, we
   administered structured questionnaires to a cross-section of adults (n =
   446), complemented with 20 in-depth interviews. Binary logistic
   regression and the framework approach were used to analyze the data.
   About one-half (51.1\%, n = 228) of the respondents were willing to take
   the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine acceptance was higher among older
   respondents (>= 30 years) (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.76, 95\%
   Confidence Interval (CI): 1.14-2.99 (>= 30 vs. <30), higher-income
   earners (>= 30,000 Naira) (aOR = 2.06, 95\%CI:1.12-3.80, >= 30,000 vs.
   <30,000), and those with a history of a chronic medical disorder (aOR =
   1.90, 95\%CI:1.06-3.72). Vaccine acceptance was also higher in persons
   with high risk perception (aOR = 1.61, 95\%CI:1.13-2.81, high vs. low),
   those who were unconcerned about vaccine safety (aOR = 1.71,
   95\%CI:1.13-3.55), and those who were not worried about efficacy (aOR =
   2.02, 95\%CI:1.14-4.11) and infertility-related rumors (aOR = 1.98,
   95\%CI:1.24-3.18). Themes revealed doubts about the existence of
   COVID-19, mistrust for authorities, and popular credence to rumors and
   conspiracy theories. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was
   sub-optimal and influenced by respondent's age, income, co-morbidities,
   risk perception, and concerns about vaccine safety, efficacy, and
   rumors. Context-specific, evidence-based risk communication strategies
   and trust-building measures could boost vaccine confidence in similar
   settings.},

Abstract = {Objective The adherence to public health recommendations to control
   COVID-19 spread is influenced by public knowledge, attitudes and
   practices (KAP). We performed this cross-sectional study to assess the
   levels and determinants of public KAP towards COVID-19 in a large,
   multinational sample. Design Cross-sectional study (survey). Setting The
   questionnaire was distributed to potential respondents via online
   platforms. Participants 71 890 individuals from 22 countries. Methods We
   formulated a four-section questionnaire in English, followed by
   validation and translation into seven languages. The questionnaire was
   distributed (May to June 2020) and each participant received a score for
   each KAP section. Results Overall, the participants had fair knowledge
   (mean score: 19.24 +/- 3.59) and attitudes (3.72 +/- 2.31) and good
   practices (12.12 +/- 1.83) regarding COVID-19. About 92\% reported
   moderate to high compliance with national lockdown. However, significant
   gaps were observed: only 68.2\% knew that infected individuals may be
   asymptomatic; 45.4\% believed that antibiotics are an effective
   treatment; and 55.4\% stated that a vaccine has been developed (at the
   time of data collection). 71.9\% believed or were uncertain that
   COVID-19 is a global conspiracy; 36.8\% and 51\% were afraid of
   contacting doctors and Chinese people, respectively. Further, 66.4\%
   reported the pandemic had moderate to high negative effects on their
   mental health. Female gender, higher education and urban residents had
   significantly (p <= 0.001) higher knowledge and practice scores.
   Further, we observed significant correlations between all KAP scores.
   Conclusions Although the public have fair/good knowledge and practices
   regarding COVID-19, significant gaps should be addressed. Future
   awareness efforts should target less advantaged groups and future
   studies should develop new strategies to tackle COVID-19 negative mental
   health effects.},

Abstract = {Research objectives: To clarify the circumstances around the beginning
   of the Time of Troubles in the Golden Horde in 1359-1360, the overthrow
   of Kulpa Khan and the coup d'etat of Navruz Khan.
   Research materials: The author analyzes the whole body of Russian
   chronicles that mention this event, and for the first time ever
   publishes a unique text of the Venetian notary Benedetto Bianco, who
   reported this event. The article contains both the original text in
   Latin from the cartulary of acts kept in the Venetian State Archive in
   Italy, and the Russian translation of the source.
   The novelty and results of the research: In general, the published
   document confirms and clarifies the account in Russian chronicles that
   Navruz's coup occurred in the winter of 1360 and was the result of a
   conspiracy of the Horde's nobility. As a result of the coup, Kulpa, his
   two sons and the emirs supporting him died. In addition to the exact
   date of the coup, Benedetto Bianco's record also reveals interesting
   details about the patronage of Kulpa to Christians, apparently the
   Catholic monastic orders active in those years in the Golden Horde and
   the Italian merchants who traded there. The notary's record vividly
   portrays the circumstances of the coup that occurred in the steppe,
   perhaps during a campaign, a journey or hunting trip, rather than at the
   khan's residence. Being in the center of events, Bianco is accurate on
   details and dates, which further increases the value of his description.
   Both after Navruz's coup and before it, Tana's trading post was
   continuously being rebuilt and settled, still recovering after the long
   break of the 1340-50s. Transactions for the purpose of acquiring real
   estate, land and houses, in Tana occupy an important place in the acts
   of Benedetto Bianco.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to a rather important area of relations between
   the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Poland over a rather long period -
   the end of the 18th - the beginning of the 19th centuries, filled with
   fateful events that determined the negative context of these relations
   for the next centuries. The authors set the goal of creating a
   scientific model of such a variant of historical development, in which
   the reality of the possible influence of Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich
   Romanov on changing the vector of coexistence between Russia and Poland
   is hypothetically assessed. The main milestones in the life and
   character traits of this historical figure are analyzed in the context
   of possible alternatives to his activities before and during his 15-year
   stay in Poland. Despite the underestimation and even denial of the role
   of the individual in history by some experts, the qualities inherent in
   rulers who make fateful decisions that determine the fate of their
   subjects are of considerable importance. This is clearly seen in the
   example of the fate and activities of the hero of the article. The
   author's vision of the person of Tsesarevich Konstantin Pavlovich as a
   bright and popular personality (it was not for nothing that several
   False Konstantins appeared after his death) shows that historical
   science underestimated the power of influence of his character traits on
   the fate of the Polish state. To substantiate the assumption, the
   methods of source study, historical and logical analysis and synthesis
   are used, which made it possible to consider the relationship between
   the Poland he ruled and the Russian Empire from the point of view of the
   individual qualities of the governor. The source base includes both
   classical studies of this issue (S. M. Solovyov), memoirs and memoirs,
   as well as modern research (Stegniy P. V. and others). The methods of
   historical retrospection, chronological and problem-analytical
   approaches make it possible to model the likelihood of an alternative
   history: smoothing out the contradictions between the two Slavic
   countries and returning independence to Poland.},

Abstract = {America is in the midst of experiencing the sesquicentennial of the
   Civil War. We do so with some ambivalence knowing that the war forged a
   great union and ended slavery but also caused the deaths of more than
   600,000 fellow citizens. Samuel A. Mudd, MD, University of Maryland
   School of Medicine class of 1856, was a man of this time. As a
   physician-farmer in Southern Maryland, he was a highly respected
   physician, a slave owner, and a devout citizen. The Civil War
   (1861-1865) would alter his life in ways few could have imagined. This
   article looks at his background, his education, his work as a
   physician-farmer, and his dramatic rise to national attention and
   infamy. Convicted by a military tribunal and imprisoned for his
   ``crimes,'' he was able to partially redeem himself using his medical
   skills and professionalism. Mudd was a man of his time. And what a time
   it was.},

Title = {The COVID-19 Pandemic Mental Health Questionnaire (CoPaQ): psychometric
   evaluation and compliance with countermeasures in psychiatric inpatients
   and non-clinical individuals},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHIATRY},

Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted people's lives
   across a broad spectrum of psychosocial domains. We report the
   development and psychometric evaluation of the self-report COVID-19
   Pandemic Mental Health Questionnaire (CoPaQ), which assesses COVID-19
   contamination anxiety, countermeasure necessity and compliance, mental
   health impact, stressor impact, social media usage, interpersonal
   conflicts, paranoid ideations, institutional \& political trust,
   conspiracy beliefs, and social cohesion. Further, we illustrate the
   questionnaire's utility in an applied example investigating if higher
   SARS-Cov-2 infection rates in psychiatric patients could be explained by
   reduced compliance with preventive countermeasures.
   Methods: A group of 511 non-clinical individuals completed an initial
   pool of 111 CoPaQ items (Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/3evn9/)
   and additional scales measuring psychological distress, well-being, and
   paranoia to assess construct validity and lifetime mental health
   diagnosis for criterion validity. Factor structure was determined by
   exploratory factor analyses and validated by conducting confirmatory
   factor analysis in the accompanying longitudinal sample (n = 318) and an
   independent psychiatric inpatient sample primarily admitted for major
   depressive-, substance abuse-, personality-, and anxiety disorders (n =
   113). Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's Alpha and
   McDonald's Omega. For the applied research example, Welch t-tests and
   correlational analyses were conducted.
   Results: Twelve out of 16 extracted subscales were retained in the final
   questionnaire version, which provided preliminary evidence for adequate
   psychometric properties in terms of factor structure, internal
   consistency, and construct and criterion validity. Our applied research
   example showed that patients exhibited greater support for COVID-19
   countermeasures than non-clinical individuals. However, this requires
   replication in future studies.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate that the CoPaQ is a comprehensive and valid
   measure of the psychosocial impact of the pandemic and could allow to a
   degree to disentangle the complex psychosocial phenomena of the pandemic
   as exemplified by our applied analyses.},

Abstract = {Like the alcohol industry was during Prohibition, the marijuana industry
   is a profitable one. And, as bootlegging was then, selling marijuana in
   the United States is currently illegal. Despite the number of states
   that have legalized or decriminalized the sale of marijuana for medical
   or recreational use under state law, marijuana sales remain illegal as a
   matter of federal law under the federal Controlled Substances Act of
   1970 ({''}CSA{''}). Individuals and entities that violate the CSA face
   substantial criminal and civil liability, including prison time and
   fines, alongside a host of additional negative consequences arising from
   business, tax, bankruptcy, and banking law, as well as other sources.
   The negative consequences that marijuana businesses face have been
   discussed in detail elsewhere. This Essay asks a different question: not
   what are the negative consequences, but rather, when do those negative
   consequences attach? In other words, when does a company become a
   ``Marijuana Business{''}?
   For purposes of this discussion, a Marijuana Business is an entity that
   participates, contributes, or assists, directly or indirectly, in the
   retail and/or medical marijuana industry to an extent that exposes it,
   its owners, and its agents to potential criminal and civil liability and
   other negative business consequences. In short, these are the companies
   that should be worried about the fact that they are engaging in an
   industry that is illegal under federal law. To identify the
   circumstances that result in a company's being a Marijuana Business,
   this Essay analyzes seven hypothetical companies that directly
   participate in the marijuana industry or support others that do. For
   each, the Essay asks whether the facts are sufficient to establish
   criminal liability either directly under the CSA or indirectly under
   criminal conspiracy or aiding and abetting liability theories.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Portugal has one of the highest vaccine coverage rates
   among European countries, associated with excellent vaccine convenience
   and confidence levels. Considering both the high rate of pediatric
   vaccination in Portugal and the excellent indicators of vaccine
   convenience established, an analysis of confidence and complacency
   indicators could help understand this positive example. This study aimed
   to characterize parental beliefs according to the intention to vaccinate
   a next child and identify cognitive and demographic predictors of that
   intention in a Portuguese sample.
   Methods: We measured perceptions of vaccines' safety and efficacy,
   perceptions of the severity of vaccine-preventable diseases, beliefs
   related to conspiracy theories, attitudes towards immunization
   requirements, perceptions of social norms as predictors of the intention
   to vaccinate a subsequent child. We also inquired if parents had
   previously refused a recommended vaccine. The authors disseminated the
   questionnaire online to reach a diverse population of parents of 0-12
   years old children. The final sample included 1,118 parents, 96.9\%
   reported their intention to vaccinate the next child, and 3.6\% had
   previously refused a vaccine. Two additional open-ended questions
   regarding motives to vaccinate or refuse a future baby's vaccination
   were answered by 886 parents.
   Results: All the evaluated parental cognitive dimensions were
   significantly different between the group of parents who would vaccinate
   a next child and those who expressed the intention not to vaccinate.
   Beliefs about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and having fewer
   children were significant predictors of that intention.
   Conclusion: The vast majority of parents reported attitudes and beliefs
   favorable to pediatric vaccination with high consistency in all
   cognitive dimensions assessed. Concerns regarding pediatric vaccines'
   safety need to be sensitively and actively addressed by health providers
   to maintain excellent vaccination coverage rates.},

Abstract = {This article explores the interrelated questions of form and identity in
   the Japanese anime feature Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade. The film is a
   reworking of the fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood, set in an alternate
   Japan which was conquered by Nazi Germany at the end of World War II.
   The main character of the film is a young recruit to a special police
   unit named Kazuki Fuse. His inability to kill a young girl carrying a
   bomb leads to disciplinary action from his superiors, but also draws the
   attention of the rival division in the police force, which is looking
   for a way to abolish the special unit. The narrative explores whether or
   not the traumatized young officer will be capable of using violence to
   defend himself and his unit. The question of whether Fuse is a rapacious
   wolf, capable of remorseless violence, or a sensitive victim of trauma
   converges with the question of the status of the film in relation to its
   medium. For Jin-Roh is a political thriller that, with the exception of
   one scene, might as well have been shot as a live action feature.
   Engaging the work of animation scholar Thomas Lamarre on the
   distinctions between the animetic image and the cinematic image, the
   article seeks to demonstrate that the question of the film's film can
   only be addressed by reference to how the narrative resolves the
   question of the protagonist's interiority. It is the one scene that
   resists being translated into a live action sequence that holds the key
   to the enigmatic behavior of the protagonist. Fuse proves fully capable
   of defending himself against armed men and defeating the conspiracy to
   destroy the special unit, while remaining a traumatized individual who
   becomes complicit in worsening his own state of psychic anguish.},

Year = {2015},

Pages = {131-140},
Abstract = {This study aims to investigate John Barth's The Development in the light
   of trauma theory. Traumatic events were firstly discussed in Freud's
   Studies in Hysteria, and then were revisited in Beyond the Pleasure
   Principle. They can have happened in the past life of a subject, can be
   unacceptable to their consciousness, and yet they can return in the form
   of compulsive and repetitive behaviors. Possible symptoms may be more
   the result of the subject's repressed desires than traumatic events.
   Moreover, traumas are not only the result of the subject's personal
   experience but the ramifications of the historical context and past
   environment to which the subject is bound. In Barth's The Development:
   Nine Stories the tales are narrated by aging people who struggle with
   forces around them which affect their lives. These forces compel a
   couple to a pact of spontaneous suicide. Loss, family, and social
   dysfunction are among the other outcomes of trauma which are satirised
   in a conspiratorial tone. Symbolised in Heron Bay Estates, the American
   society is depicted as a gated community that must come to terms with
   the illusions of safety and conspiracy, for they are not walled off
   traumas that lurk in their most private moments. Barth demonstrates that
   a gated community can never protect its members from possible traumas.
   An analysis of traumatic experiences should be considered along with the
   linguistic and non-linguistic means of representation through which an
   event is recollected because the event is reconstructed to reach
   equilibrium to comprehend the occurrence of the trauma. In the stories
   of The Development such verbal representations of temporality are
   enslaved to traumatic events. And this will explore how the narrative of
   a past history and temporality through traumatised subjects enable the
   representation of the hidden aspects both of history and the
   subconscious.},

Title = {Revision of three-stakeholder signaling game for environmental impact
   assessment in China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},

Abstract = {Since environmental impact assessment (EIA) regulations were adopted in
   China 30 years ago, the implementation rate of EIA policies for
   development projects has been steadily increasing while national
   environmental quality keeps deteriorating. This contradiction prevents
   achievement of the goals that the regulations were originally created
   for, raising concerns regarding the EIA implementation process. One of
   the objectives of EIA is the evaluation of socio-economic costs
   introduced by various commercial activities. However, independent
   economic entities are inclined to break away from these cost related
   responsibilities, making it necessary for government agencies and EIA
   organizations to participate in the evaluation process. The practice of
   avoiding costs may also bring forth other issues, such as rent-seeking
   behavior and conspiracies. Reducing private costs and the tendency of
   the three EIA stakeholders to evade social responsibility are
   intertwined in every EIA process. Their activities are as follows: The
   government is the lawmaker whose attitude toward the EIA organization
   determines how business owners react in the EIA process. The government
   inclination can be interpreted as a signal from which enterprises can
   determine the nature of the government, which helps the enterprise
   owners formulate their future actions. A similar relationship also
   exists among the government, EIA organizations, and enterprise entities.
   Fundamentally, the correlations between the EIA stakeholders are
   determined by their socio-economic situation, namely, the economic costs
   and benefits they encounter. In this article, signaling game theory
   derived from the classic game theory is applied to describe the EIA
   process in China by analyzing the activities of the stakeholders and
   searching for game equilibrium solutions. The optimal reaction schema
   for stakeholders was obtained by transforming the equilibrium. (c) 2010

Title = {The influence of the Ottoman wars on the development of towns in the

Abstract = {Monetary taxes formed the main part of the tax obligation of the royal
   boroughs of the Kingdom of Hungary up to the last third of the 1611
   century. Among them, the census was practically insignificant in amount
   and usually not paid in the 16(th) century. The lucrum camerae was a
   tax, which could only be levied by the Hungarian Parliament, although
   its level was decided by the Court Chamber. From the first decade of the
   17(th) century, the taxes began to increase, the census was collected
   regularly and they tried to levy the lucrum camerae also in years when
   parliament did not meet. In the mid 1711 century, taxa came to be paid
   every two and later every three years. After the Wesselenyi Conspiracy
   (1670), a similar tax system to that applied in other parts of the
   Habsburg Monarchy was introduced. Portia was a tax intended to support
   the army operating in the country, and its amount depended on the size
   of the army. Accisa was a consumption tax charged on meat and alcohol.
   Apart from this, the 16(th)-17(th) century towns had to pay for the
   support of a certain number of soldiers, who served in nearby castles.
   They had to provide transport services and provide tabour for the
   construction of fortifications.
   In the 16(th) century, it was not usual for the royal boroughs to fall
   behind with their tax payments. At the beginning of the 17(th) century,
   the tax system changed, European wars disturbed traditional market
   connections, the income of towns declined, and this meant a general
   decline in regularity of payments. Up to the end of the 17(th) century,
   every town struggled with high arrears in tax payments. The study traces
   the level of indebtedness in the case of the town of Trnava.},

Abstract = {We report the detection of a hot, diffuse intragroup medium with the
   ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter in the NGC 2300 group of
   galaxies. This is the first time such a gas component has been found in
   a small group. The gas distribution is roughly symmetric, centered
   within approximately 3' of the elliptical NGC 2300, and extends to a
   radius of at least 0.2 h50(-1) Mpc. A Raymond-Smith (1977) hot plasma
   model provides an excellent fit to the X-ray spectrum, with a best-fit
   value temperature of 0.9(-0.14)+0.15 keV and abundance 0.06(-0.05)+0.12
   solar. This temperature, combined with the assumption of gravitational
   confinement, leads to a total mass of the group of 3.0(-0.5)+0.4 x
   10(13) M.. A reasonable estimate of the baryonic mass in galaxies and
   diffuse gas indicates that baryons can account for approximately 4\% of
   this mass. A conspiracy of errors could push this number no higher than
   10\%-15\%. This is one of the strongest pieces of evidence that dark
   matter dominates small groups such as this one, and is in agreement with
   dynamical arguments for masses of groups of galaxies. The intragroup
   medium in this system has the lowest metal abundance yet found in
   diffuse gas in a group or cluster. While not as dense as in clusters,
   the intragroup medium is still capable of significantly affecting the
   outer parts of galaxies in this group. In particular, the spiral galaxy
   NGC 2276 displays asymmetries in its optical and radio morphologies
   suggestive of an ongoing intragroup medium-galaxy encounter. This
   peculiar `'bowshock-shaped'' morphology is shared by spiral galaxies in
   other nearby groups, suggesting that it can be used as an optical
   indicator of the presence of a diffuse intragroup medium.},

Abstract = {The article examines the evidences of the early hagiographic tradition
   about the attitude of Christians to Rome. For the martyrs themselves,
   who were striving for death, the opposition to the Romans did not
   matter, but this topic could attract the attention of the authors and
   editors of the acta and passions. The surviving texts do not directly
   accuse Christians of conspiracy, nor are there obvious manifestations of
   their political disloyalty, but some of the ideas contained in them make
   it possible to understand the concerns of the Romans. First of all, this
   is the attitude of Christians to the Cult of the Emperor: the refusal of
   the martyrs to celebrate it put them outside the law, turning them into
   traitors and a threat to the State. They opposed the eternal Kingdom of
   God and the temporary power of Caesars. The Roman identity was replaced
   by the Christian one: martyrs considered themselves as citizens not of
   Rome, but of the Kingdom of God. Christians pointed out that the Emperor
   was ordained by God, which means that His instructions and commandments
   were more important. The execution of the martyrs, which was supposed to
   humiliate them, turned into a celebration of faith, which violated the
   established ritual of maintaining Roman order. The convicted Christian
   disturbed the usual course of events, he welcomed torture, rejoiced in
   death and supervised his own execution. Finally, the texts of the
   martyrdom are typologically similar to Acta Alexandrinorum, records of
   the trial and execution of pagans who criticized Rome. Observing the
   evolution of the image of Roman magistrates, we see how gradually the
   clash of the martyr and the entire Roman order turned into a conflict
   between a virtuous Christian and an evil governor of the province, thus
   removing the responsibility for the persecution from the Emperor.},

Abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) escalated into a real pandemic
   within 3.5 months and had caused 183 000 deaths in 2020. The
   complexities of COVID-19 since the end of 2019 and throughout 2020 left
   a mouth full and the second wave has not least to be said. The purpose
   of this article is to challenge the response of the church in a time
   when her voice is mostly needed. During the lockdown Level 5, churches
   were amongst the many trends that had to close their doors to the
   believers and the community. This was a great shock because churches
   throughout history have been known as safe havens and anchorages.
   Churches helped with answers to unanswered questions, and in some
   instances, confessional statements and creeds were born. In the case of
   COVID-19, a lot of conspiracy theories went viral about COVID-19 and the
   vaccines that were still in their research stage. Lots of speculations
   rose as to the cause of this pandemic. The implementation of 5G was
   viewed as the cause of the coronavirus at the beginning of 2020, and
   much had to be done to correct this fallacy. Another controversial
   fallacy was the link of the vaccination with the beast's mark, as was
   recently also insinuated in Chief Justice's prayer. Questions have
   already been asked, what is the voice of the church in this regard?
   Congregation deals with this in different ways. Hence the relevance to
   the question, how timely can exegesis be to contemporary ecclesiology?
   What would be relevant hermeneutics that could assist in embodying faith
   in a corona-defined world?
   Contribution: This article strives to develop an interpretation of 666
   that could be relevant to the questions asked and suggest a way forward
   in embodying faith in a corona-defined world and beyond.},

Abstract = {This article describes works of Yakov Lensu - a researcher of religious
   beliefs and culture of the Finno-Ugric peoples which lived on the
   territory of the Leningrad Region in 1920s to 1930s. He was one of the
   first Russian researchers, who described the syncretic religious beliefs
   and customs of the Ingrians Finnish ethnic subdivisions (Yevremeyans and
   Savakotes), as well as the Finno-Ugric peoples of Izhora and Vod. From
   the beginning of the 1920s Y. Lensu was actively working at the summer
   expeditions of the Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of
   the Population of the Borderlands of Russia (KIPS). Later he was working
   at the Institute for Studies of the Peoples of the USSR (IPIN), in which
   culture and the life of the USSR peoples were studying. The religious
   life map of USSR was also compiling there. Yakov Lensu was regularly
   participating the section of the study of religious beliefs of the
   peoples of the USSR, led by Nikolai Matorin. The section was functioning
   in the Museum of the History of Religion of the Academy of Sciences of
   the USSR for many years until N. Matorin was arrested. Y. Lensu was also
   engaged in different linguistic research. He was studying Izhora and Vod
   peoples' dialects. In the appendix of this article the part of the
   manuscript of Y. Lensu's research work ``About Finnish people beliefs at
   the Leningrad's environ{''} is published. Lensu described various
   mythological characters like a demons of natural loci and
   demons-assistants in this text. Among the demons-assistants an important
   place was occupied by Para: three-legged demonic creature, which helped
   housewives to increase milk quantity of cows. It was important because
   milk production was traditional for the Finnish people of Ingri. Texts
   of conspiracies from bleeding and from snake bites are also included in
   the manuscript.},

Title = {SMALL SCATTER AND NEARLY ISOTHERMAL MASS PROFILES TO FOUR HALF-LIGHT
   RADII FROM TWO-DIMENSIONAL STELLAR DYNAMICS OF EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {804},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {We study the total mass density profile for a sample of 14 fast-rotator
   early-type galaxies (stellar masses 10.2 less than or similar to
   logM({*})/M-circle dot less than or similar to 11.7). We combine
   observations from the SLUGGS and ATLAS(3D) surveys to map out the
   stellar kinematics in two dimensions, out to a median radius for the
   sample of four half-light radii R-e (or 10 kpc) and a maximum radius of
   2.0-6.2 R-e (or 4-21 kpc). We use axisymmetric dynamical models based on
   the Jeans equations, which allow for a spatially varying anisotropy;
   employ quite general profiles for the dark halos; and, in particular, do
   not place any restrictions on the profile slope. This is made possible
   by the availability of spatially extended two-dimensional kinematics. We
   find that our relatively simple models provide a remarkably good
   description of the observed kinematics. The resulting total density
   profiles are well described by a nearly isothermal power law rho(tot)(r)
   proportional to r(-gamma) from R-e/10 to at least 4R(e), the largest
   average deviation being 11\%. The average logarithmic slope is <gamma >
   = 2.19 +/- 0.03 with observed rms scatter of just sigma(gamma) = 0.11.
   This scatter out to large radii, where dark matter dominates, is as
   small as previously reported by lensing studies around r approximate to
   R-e/2, where the stars dominate. Our bulge halo conspiracy places much
   tighter constraints on galaxy formation models. It illustrates the power
   of two-dimensional stellar kinematics observations at large radii. It is
   now important to test the generality of our results for different galaxy
   types and larger samples.},

Title = {Vaccine criticism on the World Wide Web},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: The incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases is directly
   related to the number of unvaccinated children. Parents who refuse
   vaccination of their children frequently express concerns about vaccine
   safety. The Internet can influence perceptions about vaccines because it
   is the fastest growing source of consumer health information. However,
   few studies have analyzed vaccine criticism on the Web.
   Objective: The purposes of this paper are to examine vaccine criticism
   on the Internet and to analyze the websites in order to identify common
   characteristics and ethical allegations.
   Methods: A structured Web search was conducted for the terms
   ``vaccine,{''} ``vaccination,{''} ``vaccinate:{''} and
   ``anti-vaccination{''} using a metasearch program that incorporated 8
   search engines. This yielded 1138 Web pages representing 750 sites. Two
   researchers reviewed the sites for inclusion/exclusion criteria,
   resulting in 78 vaccine-critical sites, which were then abstracted for
   design, content, and allegations.
   Results: The most common characteristic of vaccine-critical websites was
   the inclusion of statements linking vaccinations with specific adverse
   reactions, especially idiopathic chronic diseases such as multiple
   sclerosis, autism, and diabetes. Other common attributes (>= 70\% of
   websites) were links to other vaccine-critical websites; charges that
   vaccines contain contaminants, mercury, or ``hot lots{''} that cause
   adverse events; claims that vaccines provide only temporary protection
   and that the diseases prevented are mild; appeals for responsible
   parenting through education and resisting the establishment; allegations
   of conspiracies and cover-ups to hide the truth about vaccine safety;
   and charges that civil liberties are violated through mandatory
   vaccination.
   Conclusions: Vaccine-critical websites frequently make serious
   allegations. With the burgeoning of the Internet as a health information
   source, an undiscerning or incompletely educated public may accept these
   claims and refuse vaccination of their children. As this occurs, the
   incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases can be expected to rise.},

Title = {To trust or not to trust: an exploratory qualitative study of personal
   and community perceptions of vaccines amongst a group of young community
   healthcare workers in Soweto, South Africa},

Abstract = {As South Africa debates the implementation of mandatory vaccination
   policies to address coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine
   hesitancy, many adults remain unpersuaded of the need and benefits of
   vaccination. Several surveys suggest that this is particularly true for
   younger adults and for those living in low-income communities.
   Therefore, we sought the views of youth training to become community
   health workers (CHWs) as a youth group at the intersection of the
   community and the health system. This research was conducted in a
   township of South Africa, a country with a long history of political
   mistrust. Using semi-structured interviews and an interview guide, we
   explored young CHWs' perceptions (n = 20) of vaccine hesitancy for
   themselves, their peers and the community. Audio-recorded interviews
   were transcribed, and thematic analysis was undertaken. Findings suggest
   widespread COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in this community, especially
   amongst young people. Reported reasons for this hesitancy appear linked
   to a complex interrelated network of factors, including `uncertainty'
   about the outcome and effectiveness of the vaccines; `fear' of the
   vaccines, driven by a myriad of rumours and conspiracy theories within
   the community; a `lack of control' over other people's behaviour and a
   desire not to be controlled especially by the government but at the same
   time a resignation towards impending mandatory vaccine policies and a
   `lack of trust' particularly in the government's intentions with vaccine
   roll-out and their health messaging. While mandatory vaccination
   policies in several organizations have shown success, with South
   Africa's complex social history and recent civil unrest, the roll-out of
   any mandatory vaccination policy will require careful health messaging
   with a focus on trust-building between communities, health systems and
   authorities through more personalized approaches that consider
   contextual nuances.},

Title = {``Wars{''} on COVID-19 in Slovakia, Russia, and the United States:
   Securitized Framing and Reframing of Political and Media Communication
   Around the Pandemic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {This study analyzes securitized discourses and counter narratives that
   surround the COVID-19 pandemic. Controversial cases of security related
   political communication, salient media enunciations, and social media
   reframing are explored through the theoretical lenses of securitization
   and cascading activation of framing in the contexts of Slovakia, Russia,
   and the United States. The first research question explores whether and
   how the frame element of moral evaluation factors into the conversations
   on the securitization of the pandemic. The analysis tracks the framing
   process through elite, media, and public levels of communication. The
   second research question focused on fairly controversial actors- ``rogue
   actors{''} -such as individuals linked to far-leaning political factions
   or militias. The proliferation of digital media provides various actors
   with opportunities to join publicly visible conversations. The analysis
   demonstrates that the widely differing national contexts offer different
   trends and degrees in securitization of the pandemic during spring and
   summer of 2020. The studied rogue actors usually have something to say
   about the pandemic, and frequently make some reframing attempts based on
   idiosyncratic evaluations of how normatively appropriate is their
   government's ``war{''} on COVID-19. In Slovakia, the rogue elite actors
   at first failed to have an impact but eventually managed to partially
   contest the dominant frame. Powerful Russian media influencers enjoy
   some conspiracy theories but prudently avoid direct challenges to the
   government's frame, and so far only marginal rogue actors openly advance
   dissenting frames. The polarized political and media environment in the
   US has shown to create a particularly fertile ground for rogue
   grassroots movements that utilize online platforms and social media, at
   times going as far as encouragement of violent acts to oppose the
   government and its pandemic response policy.},

Title = {RE-READING VSEVOLOD IVANOV'S STORY ``THE ARMORED TRAIN 14-69{''} AGAINST
   SIBERIAN PERIODICALS (1919): THE HISTORICAL COMMENT OF THE RUSSIAN
   ALLIES IN THE CIVIL WAR},
Journal = {STUDIA LITTERARUM},

Pages = {230-249},
Abstract = {The essay discusses the role that the allied powers - United States,
   France, Britain, and Japan - played in the development and in the
   collapse of the Admiral A.V. Kolchak's anti-Bolshevik Russian government
   between 1918 and 1920. The discussion is based on the material of the
   hitherto unknown newspaper publications by Vsevolod Ivanov issued in
   1919 by a military newspaper Vpered (Forward) and his literary works.
   The latter include his classic story about the Civil War entitled ``The
   Armored Train 14-69{''} (1921), the homonymous plays (1927), and the
   screenplay (1963). For the first time, the article closely examines
   Ivanov's cooperation with the newspaper Forward. The newspaper's editor,
   Colonel V.G. Yanchevetsky, supported the government in major political
   questions. Ivanov's articles ``Bonds of friendship{''} (1919. September
   26) and ```Go' and `Captain - (1919. October 16) represent polar views
   on the role that the allies of the Russian government played in the
   Civil War. The first article underlines the importance of friendly
   relations with the allies that emerged during the First World War and
   that developed during the years of struggle against the
   ``Bolshevik-German armies.{''} Ivanov's second article, a response to
   the events in Vladivostok in the Fall 1919 - particularly, to the secret
   support of the anti-government conspiracy of the
   Socialist-Revolutionaries and Bolsheviks on behalf of the allied forces
   calls for the necessity to concentrate Russia's forces and to strengthen
   Russia's place in the international arena. The present article shows how
   Ivanov's position about the allies developed under the 1919 Siberian
   circumstances, was reflected in his literary work. For example, it
   analyzes a plot line associated with the treacherous behavior of the
   Japanese lieutenant Tanako Muzzi that first appeared in the ``The
   Armored Train 14-69{''} and then got developed in the homonymous play.},

Title = {Paris emission inventory diagnostics from ESQUIF airborne measurements
   and a chemistry transport model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},

Abstract = {During the Atmospheric Pollution Over the Paris Area (ESQUIF) experiment
   a series of airborne measurements were collected in the vicinity of the
   city of Paris during smog episodes. They are used in combination with an
   air quality photochemical model in order to diagnose uncertainties in
   the current emission inventory. Diagnostics are made by comparing
   simulated with observed concentrations for nitrogen oxides, carbon
   monoxide, and primary hydrocarbons, taking into account the chemistry
   and transport processes of these compounds. An emphasis is put on the
   uncertainty of the results, taking into account the finiteness of the
   measurement samples, possible errors in the model transport, and
   chemistry and measurement errors. We examine, in particular, possible
   sources of bias in the model. For instance, we show that boundary layer
   depth is underestimated by at most 30\% on average. However, sensitivity
   experiments showed that these model biases, taken individually, cannot
   alter the qualitative aspects of our results. Only a conspiracy of these
   biases could possibly shift all our diagnostics toward significantly
   different results. There is reasonable consistency between simulated and
   measured concentrations. NOy simulations agree with measured
   concentrations to within 35\%; CO concentrations agree to within a
   factor of 2. There are significant underestimations and overestimations
   in some individual primary hydrocarbons. However, the total mass and
   reactivity of the measured hydrocarbon mixture, which accounts for only
   about half of the total emitted mass, agree with modeled values to
   within an estimated uncertainty of 40\%. The analysis of results
   provides clues for improving emission inventories. It is found, for
   instance, that temperature dependence, which is not considered here, can
   be a key factor and that hydrocarbon emissions from solvent use may
   suffer from inaccurate totals or speciation. Another source of
   uncertainties may be the temporal or spatial distributions of solvent
   activities.},

Abstract = {Healthcare professionals often censor their information giving to
   patients in an attempt to protect them from potentially hurtful, sad or
   bad news. There is a commonly expressed belief that what people do not
   know does not harm them. Analysis of doctor and nurse/patient
   interactions reveals that this well-intentioned but misguided assumption
   about human behaviour is present at all stages of cancer care. Less than
   honest disclosure is seen from the moment that a patient reports
   symptoms, to the confirmation of diagnosis, during discussions about the
   therapeutic benefits of treatment, at relapse and terminal illness. This
   desire to shield patients from the reality of their situation usually
   creates even greater difficulties for patients, their relatives and
   friends and other members of the healthcare team. Although the
   motivation behind economy with the truth is often well meant, a
   conspiracy of silence usually results in a heightened state of fear,
   anxiety and confusion - not one of calm and equanimity. Ambiguous or
   deliberately misleading information may afford short-term benefits while
   things continue to go well, but denies individuals and their families
   opportunities to reorganize and adapt their lives towards the attainment
   of more achievable goals, realistic hopes and aspirations. In this
   paper, some examples and consequences of accidental, deliberate, if
   well-meaning, attempts to disguise the truth from patients, taken
   verbatim from interviews, are given, together with cases of
   unintentional deception or misunderstandings created by the use of
   ambiguous language. We also provide evidence from research studies
   showing that although truth hurts, deceit may well hurt more. `I think
   the best physician is the one who has the providence to tell to the
   patients according to his knowledge the present situation, what has
   happened before, and what is going to happen in the future'
   (Hippocrates).},

Title = {``Forest Kings{''} by George Grebenschikov: towards the problem of the

Abstract = {In the 1910s, G. D. Grebenshikov made active attempts to enter the
   metropolitan literary sphere and to take a high position in the
   hierarchy of writers. That was the reason for his efforts to establish
   connections with modern literature. Of note in this regard is the story
   ``Forest Kings.{''} The contextualization of Grebenschikov's plot
   revealed several motif parallels that could be in the author's field of
   vision. On the one hand, the pretext of the plot could be a popular
   ``Fisher and Hunter's Wife{''} folklore ballade, with its core narrative
   involving wife's conspired adultery, discovery, and murder of her lover.
   Also, the ballade has a similar motif of a lifestyle with forest
   harvesting, the youth of a wife, the prediction of a hero death. On the
   other hand, there is a series of parallels to A. A. Akhmatova's
   ``Grey-eyed King{''} poem that could be familiar to Grebenschikov, who
   visited the capital and sought to establish connections with writers and
   publishers in Saint-Petersburg. In this case, the following motif
   intersections draw attention: usage of ``king{''} word in the title,
   presence of the heroine's child from a lover, conspiracy, lover's death
   during hunting. Grebenschikov followed the precedent of metropolitan
   literature, thus elaborating common topics while trying to enhance his
   status and professional reputation in the literary field. The story
   presents a plot pattern peculiar to a novel based on the confrontation
   of a man ``from nature{''} and a man ``from culture,{''} with mediation
   provided by a woman. In this respect, ``Forest Kings{''} can be
   considered as a specific draft of the first volume of ``Churaevy{''} the
   epic novel, with similar love triangle conflict in the plot basis.},

Title = {How Should Doctors Frame the Risk of a Vaccine's Adverse Side Effects?
   It Depends on How Trustworthy They Are},
Journal = {MEDICAL DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 26},
Abstract = {Background. How health workers frame their communication about vaccines'
   probability of adverse side effects could play an important role in
   people's intentions to be vaccinated (e.g., positive frame: side effects
   are unlikely v. negative frame: there is a chance of side effects).
   Based on the pragmatic account of framing as implicit advice, we
   expected that participants would report greater vaccination intentions
   when a trustworthy physician framed the risks positively (v.
   negatively), but we expected this effect would be reduced or reversed
   when the physician was untrustworthy. Design. In 4 online experiments (n
   = 191, snowball sampling and n = 453, 451, and 464 UK residents via
   Prolific; M-age approximate to 34 y, 70\% women, 84\% White British), we
   manipulated the trustworthiness of a physician and how they framed the
   risk of adverse side effects in a scenario (i.e., a chance v. unlikely
   adverse side effects). Participants reported their vaccination
   intention, their level of distrust in health care systems, and COVID-19
   conspiracy beliefs. Results. Physicians who were trustworthy (v.
   untrustworthy) consistently led to an increase in vaccination intention,
   but the way they described adverse side effects mattered too. A positive
   framing of the risks given by a trustworthy physician consistently led
   to increased vaccination intention relative to a negative framing, but
   framing had no effect or the opposite effect when given by an
   untrustworthy physician. The exception to this trend occurred in
   unvaccinated individuals in experiment 3, following serious concerns
   about one of the COVID vaccines. In that study, unvaccinated
   participants responded more favorably to the negative framing of the
   trustworthy physician. Conclusions. Trusted sources should use positive
   framing to foster vaccination acceptance. However, in a situation of
   heightened fears, a negative framing-attracting more attention to the
   risks-might be more effective.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes legal problems arising in connection with the
   establishment of criminal liability for organizing a stable group of
   persons for committing crimes in the field of computer information. The
   urgency of this topic is due to the negative dynamics of crimes
   associated with computer technology and committed by criminal
   communities or organizations as well as the constant growth of damage
   from them. The author evaluates the current criminal law measures to
   counter organized cybercrime, identifying their shortcomings. The
   provisions of domestic and foreign criminal legislation were analyzed,
   which made it possible to identify some legal gaps and identify ways to
   overcome them. The article proves that the Criminal Code of the Russian
   Federation does not fully cover cases of the creation of organized
   criminal groups aimed at committing illegal activities in the field of
   computer information. In particular, responsibility is not
   differentiated between a group of persons by prior conspiracy and an
   organized group; the category of crimes and the absence of the purpose
   of making profit do not allow qualifying the act as committed by a
   criminal community or a criminal organization. It is advisable to
   recognize the very fact of the creation of illegal organized formations
   as a separate tort, as is done in the legislation of individual
   countries of the ``common law{''} legal family, as well as in domestic
   norms regulating countering terrorism and extremism. It is proposed to
   include in the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation a norm providing
   for responsibility for organizing a stable group of persons aimed at
   committing crimes in the field of computer information. The wording of
   the corresponding article has been formulated, which can be used as a
   recommendation when improving legislation.},

Title = {Online information on face masks: analysis of websites in Italian and
   English returned by different search engines},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Objective Countries have major differences in the acceptance of face
   mask use for the prevention of COVID-19. This work aims at studying the
   information online in different countries in terms of information
   quality and content.
   Design Content analysis.
   Method We analysed 450 webpages returned by searching the string `are
   face masks dangerous' in Italy, the UK and the USA using three search
   engines (Bing, Duckduckgo and Google) in August 2020. The type of
   website and the stance about masks were assessed by two raters for each
   language and inter-rater agreement reported as Cohen's kappa. The text
   of the webpages was collected from the web using WebBootCaT and analysed
   using a corpus analysis software to identify issues mentioned.
   Results Most pages were news outlets, and few (2\%-6\%) from public
   health agencies. Webpages with a negative stance on masks were more
   frequent in Italian (28\%) than English (19\%). Google returned the
   highest number of mask-positive pages and Duckduckgo the lowest. Google
   also returned the lowest number of pages mentioning conspiracy theories
   and Duckduckgo the highest. Webpages in Italian scored lower than those
   in English in transparency (reporting authors, their credentials and
   backing the information with references). When issues about the use of
   face masks were analysed, mask effectiveness was the most discussed
   followed by hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide),
   contraindication in respiratory disease and hypoxia, with issues related
   to their contraindications in mental health conditions and disability
   mentioned by very few pages.
   Conclusions This study suggests that: (1) public health agencies should
   increase their web presence in providing correct information on face
   masks; (2) search engines should improve the information quality
   criteria in their ranking; (3) the public should be more informed on
   issues related to the use of masks and disabilities, mental health and
   stigma arising for those people who cannot wear masks.},

Title = {Comparing and Analyzing Two Stories from Iran and China (Khotan)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS OF LITERARY STUDIES IN CHINA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {478-491},
Abstract = {For the analysis in this essay, I have chosen the tale of Siavash and
   Sudabeh from the Book of Kings (Shahnameh) in Persian literature and
   Kunala-avadana from Chinese (Khotanese) literature. These stories have
   full structural and narrative pattern despite their apparent simplicity
   and they can be studied and evaluated as narratological theories. The
   pattern of Todorov shows that these stories have accurate narrative
   logic; of course, narrative similarity of two stories may originate from
   common collective unconscious mind of these tribes. Anyway, these
   stories have common main and sub propositions with titles of love,
   conspiracy, refusal, trial for finding truth, loyalty of the prince to
   father etc. In addition to common propositions, actions of violation,
   change and punishment which are emphasized by Todorov are found in these
   stories. The variable action dominates but main core of actions is
   disloyalty of woman to her husband and falling in love with the prince
   finally leading to her punishment. These two stories were analyzed
   according to the Todorov's narrative analysis model. In both stories,
   you can find the same major and minor premise and proposition. That is,
   all events occur around the three characters (King, a boy and a woman
   who are related to the court), in both stories the woman loves the boy,
   but the boy remained loyal to the king, and rejects her love. The boy is
   accused with treason and finally the truth becomes evident. Propositions
   of these stories include: proper noun (characters), verb (actions) and
   adjective (features and characteristics of persons), which are common in
   both stories and are repeated identically in both stories. Also
   according to Todorov's view, the five modes in propositions (declarative
   mode, optative mode, subjunctive mode, conditional mode, predictive
   mode) have been investigated in these two stories. This will put more
   emphasis on the similarity of narrative structure of stories.},

Title = {Trial by media: evaluating the role of mainstream media and
   fact-checking agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN HEALTH CARE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 27},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to critically assess the function
   of the media during the COVID-19 pandemic. It tries to understand how
   media corporations selectively polish a certain narrative against the
   other. It will also take into consideration the role of fact-checking
   agencies and its reliability in determining what is right and wrong.
   Design/methodology/approach This study uses qualitative methods and
   relies on secondary data available in academic domains. In this paper, a
   specific case related with the COVID-19 pandemic is taken up.
   Conflicting accounts of health professionals both in academic and
   industry are compared and analysed. Professional integrity of
   fact-checking agencies as well goes through scrutiny. Findings After
   conducting a critical analysis, it is observed that media houses have
   violated certain ethics while presenting news and opinions during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Without any consideration of fair presentation, the
   mainstream media resorted to presenting vaccine hesitancy as conspiracy
   and deplatformed such voice from the media. This violates one's freedom
   to free speech and expression. Research limitations/implications It is a
   viewpoint from the side of a free speech abolitionist. Practical
   implications Press will realize that it failed in a number of occasions
   to uphold and protect its ethical values. Originality/value A study
   questioning the role of media during the COVID-9 pandemic is rare. In
   this regard, adequate literature is always a difficulty considering the
   amount of censorship imposed by health agencies, academic institutions
   and the media. This particular study is built of limited yet reliable
   information made available by academicians and independent health
   professionals. As such, the value of work which focuses on the
   alternative perspectives is believed to add value to health
   professionals, policymakers, media professionals and the general
   population.},

Title = {Opinion of German Immunologists on SARS-CoV- 2: Results of an Online
   Survey},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Background
   Little is known about the opinion of professional academic immunologists
   regarding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.
   Methodology
   In this study, we designed an online survey to determine the opinion of
   immunologically competent academics on SARS-CoV-2 compared with seasonal
   flu (the infection fatality rate, infectivity, the challenge to the
   health system, the importance of vaccine development, and the importance
   of the virulence of the virus and host factors), in addition to
   collecting demographic status variables and information sources used.
   Links to the survey were sent to all German-speaking immunologists,
   bacteriologists, virologists, and infectiologists in Germany, Austria,
   and Switzerland.
   Results
   A total of 91 full datasets were returned after three waves of requests.
   Approximately half of the respondents were male and half were more
   junior. Slightly more than half of the respondents said that the
   infection fatality rate and the infectivity were higher compared to flu,
   and 82\% said that the challenge to the health system is higher.
   Overall, 52\% found that the immune system is more important than the
   virus, and a majority (59\%) supported the current practice of
   vaccination development by telescoping. A majority were of the view that
   conspiracy theories and non-pharmacological interventions pose a greater
   danger than the virus. Respondents who were more junior but
   well-published and mostly informed by public channels were more likely
   to support a mainstream view.
   Conclusions
   German-speaking immunological professionals hold widely diverging
   opinions regarding SARS-CoV-2. Over half of the surveyed professionals
   considered SARS-CoV-2 to be more dangerous and infective than the
   seasonal flu. However, the majority considered the health system to be
   under higher strain. Interestingly, more than half of them found host
   factors more important.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to global public health. Multiple
   safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 are available with
   one-third of the global population now vaccinated. Achieving a
   sufficient level of vaccine coverage to suppress COVID-19 requires, in
   part, sufficient acceptance among the public. However, relatively high
   rates of hesitance and resistance to COVID-19 vaccination persists,
   threating public health efforts to achieve vaccine-induced population
   protection. In this study, we examined longitudinal changes in COVID-19
   vaccine acceptance, hesitance, and resistance in two nations (the United
   Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) during the first nine months of the
   pandemic, and identified individual and psychological factors associated
   with consistent non-acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Using nationally
   representative, longitudinal data from the United Kingdom (UK; N = 2025)
   and Ireland (N = 1041), we found that (1) COVID-19 vaccine acceptance
   declined in the UK and remained unchanged in Ireland following the
   emergence of approved vaccines; (2) multiple subgroups existed
   reflecting people who were consistently willing to be vaccinated
   ('Accepters': 68\% in the UK and 61\% in Ireland), consistently
   unwilling to be vaccinated ('Deniers': 12\% in the UK and 16\% in
   Ireland), and who fluctuated over time ('Moveable Middle': 20\% in the
   UK and 23\% in Ireland); and (3) the `deniers' and `moveable middle'
   were distinguishable from the `accepters' on a range of individual
   (e.g., younger, low income, living alone) and psychological (e.g.,
   distrust of scientists and doctors, conspiracy mindedness) factors. The
   use of two high-income, Western European nations limits the
   generalizability of these findings. Nevertheless, understanding how
   receptibility to COVID-19 vaccination changes as the pandemic unfolds,
   and the factors that distinguish and characterise those that are
   hesitant and resistant to vaccination is helpful for public health
   efforts to achieve vaccine-induced population protection against
   COVID-19.},

Title = {Quantifying the Impact of Public Perceptions on Vaccine Acceptance Using
   Behavioral Economics},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of public perceptions of
   vaccine safety and efficacy on intent to seek COVID-19 vaccination using
   hypothetical vaccine acceptance scenarios. The behavioral economic
   methodology could be used to inform future public health vaccination
   campaigns designed to influence public perceptions and improve public
   acceptance of the vaccine. In June 2020, 534 respondents completed
   online validated behavioral economic procedures adapted to evaluate
   COVID-19 vaccine demand in relation to a hypothetical development
   process and efficacy. An exponential demand function was used to
   describe the proportion of participants accepting the vaccine at each
   efficacy. Linear mixed effect models evaluated development process and
   individual characteristic effects on minimum required vaccine efficacy
   required for vaccine acceptance. The rapid development process scenario
   increased the rate of decline in acceptance with reductions in efficacy.
   At 50\% efficacy, 68.8\% of respondents would seek the standard vaccine,
   and 58.8\% would seek the rapid developed vaccine. Rapid vaccine
   development increased the minimum required efficacy for vaccine
   acceptance by over 9 percentage points, gamma = 9.36, p < 0.001.
   Past-3-year flu vaccination, gamma = -23.00, p < 0.001, and male
   respondents, gamma = -4.98, p = 0.037, accepted lower efficacy.
   Respondents reporting greater conspiracy beliefs, gamma = 0.39, p <
   0.001, and political conservatism, gamma = 0.32, p < 0.001, required
   higher efficacy. Male, gamma = -4.43, p = 0.013, and more conservative,
   gamma = -0.09, p = 0.039, respondents showed smaller changes in minimum
   required efficacy by development process. Information on the vaccine
   development process, vaccine efficacy, and individual differences impact
   the proportion of respondents reporting COVID-19 vaccination intentions.
   Behavioral economics provides an empirical method to estimate vaccine
   demand to target subpopulations resistant to vaccination.},

Abstract = {The author sees the present outbreaks of violence as a confirmation of
   the continued relevance of the diagnosis of the present-day German
   condition set out in The Inability to Mourn in 1967. In post-war Germany
   a pall of silence hung over the subject of Nazi atrocities, guilt and
   shame were negated and no recollection of, or active mourning for, the
   millions of German and non-German war victims took place. The author
   sees an exact parallel to this in the present violence on the part of
   young people towards foreigners, asylumseekers, Jews and gypsies, and
   the way it is mutely condoned by a silent majority, interpreting this as
   an identical instance of the denial of shame and guilt and the
   incapacity for fellow-feeling towards the poor and the underprivileged.
   The accusations of part responsibility levelled at the post-1968
   generation for the outbreaks of violence among young people are in
   Mit-scherlich's view unfounded. This generation, she argues, was the
   first to break with the conspiracy of silence in connection with
   Germany's Nazi past, thus making a process of mourning possible in the
   first place, and goes on the contend that an increasing sensitivity
   among the German population towards the prevailing inhumanity that
   foreigners and the underprivileged are subjected to is an opportunity
   for renewed self-confrontation with the unbroken virulence of the Nazi
   mentality and for a resumption of the necessary process of mourning.
   Here she also sees a possibility of actively curbing the present wave of
   violence, in contrast to the call to be heard from some politicans for
   greater toughness in education and upbringing, an approach which she
   regards as representing not a solution to the problem but rather as a
   relapse into old authoritarian constraints.},

Title = {Vaccine hesitancy: acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in Pakistan},
Journal = {CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {209+},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Purpose: The delay in acceptance or refusal to get vaccinated despite
   the availability of services is called vaccine hesitancy. The Global
   Polio Eradication Initiative in Pakistan faced consistent barriers
   preventing the eradication of the disease in the country. Similarly with
   the advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic mass
   vaccination drives were initiated to a vaccine hesitant population. The
   aim of this study is to explore the prevalence and reasons for COVID-19
   vaccine hesitancy in the Pakistani population. Materials and Methods:
   Cross-sectional study conducted during July to September 2021 using a
   snowball sampling technique targeting the adult population of Pakistan.
   The modified version of the vaccine hesitancy questionnaire related to
   the Strategic Advisory Group of Ex-perts on Immunization Vaccine
   Hesitancy matrix was distributed online. Results: Out of 973
   participants, 52.4\% were immediately willing to take the vaccine and
   con-stituted the acceptance group whereas the remaining 47.6\% who were
   still not sure formed the hesitant group. Support from leaders was found
   to be statistically significant for the dif-ference between the hesitant
   and acceptance groups (p-value=0.027). Hesitant people were concerned
   about the effectiveness of the vaccine (60.9\%) and potential side
   effects (57.9\%) as it was not sufficiently tested prior to launch
   (44.7\%). Age and education were significant fac-tors affecting the
   acceptance of vaccination. The most trusted source of information
   regard-ing vaccination was health care workers (43.8\%). Conclusion: A
   moderately high prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was reported in
   Pakistan. To overcome it, policymakers need to address the reasons for
   it. Leaders, celebrities, and healthcare workers can play an
   instrumental role in dispelling conspiracy theories regarding vaccines
   and making the vaccination drive a success.},

Title = {THE IMAGE OF A CADET PARTY'S MEMBER AMONG THE RUSSIAN ADMINISTRATIVE
   ELITE OF THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY},
Journal = {VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA-PERM UNIVERSITY HERALD-HISTORY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {110-121},
Abstract = {Based on narrative sources, the article analyzes the image of a member
   of the Constitutional Democratic Party in the circles of the Russian
   administrative elite of the early 20th century: ministers, senior
   officials, governors, etc. The memoirs of S.Y. Witte, S.E. Kryzhanovsky,
   V.N. Kokovtsov, P.L. Bark, A.A. Polovtsev, M.M. Osorgin, etc. were used.
   It is shown that the Cadets were perceived as doctrinaires who were
   detached from the life and did not understand the urgent needs of the
   country because of their blind commitment to abstract Western ideas. In
   the eyes of the highest bureaucracy, by offering an alternative model of
   the state development, the Cadets turned into fighters with the
   foundations of the existing system. Cadet politics was regarded as an
   unprincipled struggle for power in alliance with revolutionary parties;
   their program was contrary to the interests of the state, and liberal
   criticism of the actions of the authorities was seen as a ``mockery{''}
   of the bureaucracy. Equating their ideas and the needs of the country,
   the highest administrative elite used the image of the Cadet as an
   ``unscrupulous revolutionary{''} to justify the uselessness of radical
   reforms and maintain their position. The author compares this image with
   the one widespread in the right circles of the Russian Empire. The most
   important differences were the absence of anti-Semitism widespread in
   the right circles and the disbelief of the administrative elite in the
   legend of the conspiracy of some ``dark forces{''} against Russia.
   Accordingly, the Cadets were perceived as a self-sufficient force, and
   not as servants of anti-Russian forces. It is concluded that there was
   an extremely negative image of the Cadets in bureaucratic circles, which
   excluded any possibility to find a compromise between the government and
   society.},

Title = {IN CONNIVANCE WITH NATURE: INTER-FAITH CRISIS AND ECOLOGICAL DEPLETION
   IN HELON HABILA'S <i>MEASURING TIME</i>},
Journal = {ENGLISH STUDIES IN AFRICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {54},

Pages = {73-87},
Abstract = {That `ecocriticism explores the ways in which we imagine and portray the
   relationship between humans and the environment in all areas of cultural
   production' (Garrard 1) is a fact that singles out the concept as an
   indication of intellectual responsiveness on the part of its proponents
   within the framework of knowledge production. This explains why this
   paper explores the mutually hostile cultural forms of consciousness and
   identity that often emerge from the practice of Christianity and Islam,
   two world religions whose contest for universal values, when taken too
   far, as is sometimes the case, wrecks havoc on the environment and
   humanity On this score, the paper specifically examines Helon Habila's
   inventive interrogation of religious crises in Northern Nigeria - a
   region that is notorious for violent inter-faith eruptions - in his
   latest novel, Measuring Time (2007). It will thus argue that by creating
   the little rural and peaceful community of Keti in the beginning of the
   novel, Habila sets out to highlight the values of the environment in the
   sustenance of humanity's existence and living. Besides, the beauty of
   nature on the hills especially, constitutes a source of pride to the
   entire community, which is why the paper argues further that the
   inter-religious crisis that subsequently erupts, critiques, on the one
   hand, an insensate disruption of the rural tranquillity made poignant by
   environmental pollution that results in the wake of a mass human
   slaughter. On the other, the burning of the hill grove that follows is a
   conspiracy on the part of humanity to aggravate the withdrawn largesse
   of nature made visible in the drought that precedes the burning. The
   paper concludes that a greater environmental consciousness needs to be
   created where natural disaster is worsened by religious intolerance and
   violent eruptions. It is the more so when such eruptions abstract from
   the religions' claim to progress.},

Title = {NOT OF THIS EARTH: UFO STUDIES},
Journal = {LOGOS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5},
Pages = {229-254},
Abstract = {In contemporary speculative philosophy there is a tendency to theorize
   about the alien. Among these theories are the xenophenomenology of Dylan
   Trigg, the alien phenomenology of Ian Bogost, and the weird realism of
   Graham Harman. All of them assert that the alien is all around us and
   that we will see it if only we look. Nevertheless, they are all
   inexplicably ready to ignore the actual encounter with the unknown and
   the truly alien during the scientific investigation of unidentified
   flying objects (UFOs) undertaken by the United States Air Force in 1947.
   The article maintains that the UFO investigations are an indispensable
   resource without which no theories of the alien and the weird can in
   principle be developed. Only a thorough analysis of the scientific
   sources describing the encounter with UFOs will enable us apprehend the
   alien in itself without reducing it to the alien for us. To demonstrate
   this point, the author first examines the discourses about UFOs that
   have dominated mass culture from the 1940s through the woos when those
   discourses were finally marginalized. He identifies seven main types of
   discourse that gradually supersede each other: 1) encounter with the
   unknown, 2) guests from other planets, 3) mythological explanation of
   flying saucers, 4) paleocontact, 5) spiritual dimensions of the contact,
   6) alien conspiracy, 7) abductions. He then considers what topics
   occupied researchers during the period in question and how that may be
   applied in contemporary theories of the alien (through analysis of the
   methodology of UFO investigations and the classification of types of
   contacts). Finally he describes in detail the image of the alien
   popularized by mass culture (at the juncture between contemporary myths
   about abductions and UFO crashes and their representations in mass
   culture).},

Title = {Mobilizing During the Covid-19 Pandemic: From Democratic Innovation to
   the Political Weaponization of Disinformation},
Journal = {AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 5},
Abstract = {Political scholars express concern for the continued resilience of
   democracy in the face of multiple crises. In times of crisis, social
   movements articulate grievances and make demands of political leaders
   and policymakers. In contrast to the wave of pro-democracy movements
   following the 2008 global financial crash where protesters demanded
   accountability from elites, mobilization during the COVID-19 pandemic
   has defied expectations in several key ways. First, the expectation for
   protesters to mobilize primarily online in the face of the restrictions
   and risk associated with large gatherings has not been upheld. Instead,
   we have witnessed widespread ``offline{''} mass protests. Second,
   despite high mortality rates and significant disparities in the
   effectiveness of national public health responses, we have not witnessed
   widespread mobilizations demanding governments do better to protect
   citizens from the virus. Instead, we have seen two radically different
   responses: At one extreme, veterans of ``pro-democracy{''} movements
   have ``pivoted,{''} using their skills and experience to either make up
   for weak government responses to COVID-19 (Hong Kong) or to reinforce
   government efforts to contain it (Taiwan). At the other extreme,
   ``antidemocratic{''} and predominantly far right-wing movements have
   mobilized against public health measures, circulating COVID negationist
   and conspiracy messages. Indeed, the political weaponization of
   disinformation has been a notable feature of pandemic mobilization. I
   analyze these contrasting trends, highlighting the challenges they pose
   for the effective handling of the pandemic, and their broader
   implications for democratic legitimacy and resilience. In so doing, I
   call attention to the ways that mobilization during the pandemic
   challenges scholars to revisit some of our assumptions about the
   dynamics of social movements in times of crisis, and how they can foster
   or erode democracy. The analysis also suggests that scholars analyzing
   the impact of information disorders on democracy need to pay careful
   attention to offline protest as well as online transmission.},

   retrospective cohort study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives To describe COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and track trends
   over time in traditional news media. Design Retrospective cohort study
   of a large database of online articles, July 2020-June 2021. Setting
   English-language articles from 100 news outlets with the greatest reach.
   Main outcome measures Numbers and percentages of articles containing
   COVID-19 vaccine misinformation over the study period. Further analysis
   by misinformation themes and whether articles included primary
   misinformation, fact-checking or simply referred to misinformation.
   Results 41 718 (3.2\% of all COVID-19 vaccine articles) contained at
   least one of the vaccine misinformation themes based on the Boolean
   string developed for this study. The volume of such articles increased
   beginning in November 2020, but their percentage of all articles
   remained essentially stable after October 2020. 56.2\% contained at
   least one mention of a safety theme, followed by development,
   production, and distribution (26.6\%), and conspiracies (15.1\%). Of 500
   articles through January 2021 randomly selected from those identified by
   the Boolean string, 223 were not relevant, and 277 included either
   fact-checking (175 articles), refers to misinformation (87 articles) or
   primary misinformation (15 articles). In eight study weeks, the reach of
   these 277 articles (defined as visitors to the sites containing the
   articles) exceeded 250 million people. Fact-checking accounted for
   69.6\% of all reach for these articles and the number of such articles
   increased after November 2020. Overall, approximately 0.1\% (95\% CI
   0.05\% to 0.16\%) of all articles on COVID-19 vaccines in our sample
   contained primary misinformation. Conclusions COVID-19 vaccine
   misinformation in traditional news media is uncommon but has the
   capacity to reach large numbers of readers and affect the vaccine
   conversation. Recent increases in fact-checking may counteract some of
   the misinformation currently circulating.},

Title = {Municipal 5G bans during the Covid-19 pandemic: the case of Italy},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Purpose Several sources have reported an increase in the opposition to
   the fifth-generation (5G) amongst local communities following the
   outbreak of Covid-19. In Italy, more than 300 municipalities banned 5G
   rollout from their territory between April and June 2020. Researchers
   have described this phenomenon as resulting from the infodemic caused by
   the pandemic, however, local protests also accompanied the rollout of
   the previous generation of mobile communications. This paper uses
   document analysis to explore the local debate on 5G municipal bans and
   map their evolution in an Italian region. This study aims to unravel the
   complexity of this phenomenon and inform future research on the actors
   and factors underlying the opposition of local communities towards 5G.
   Design/methodology/approach The analysis focusses on Marche, a region in
   Italy where, by July 2020, 25\% of the municipalities had banned 5G
   rollout. This analysis is based on secondary data, retrieved from
   multiple online sources (articles from the local press, public
   statements and press releases, minutes from local council meetings and
   resolutions from local councils). Findings The analysis revealed that
   concerns on the safety of electromagnetic fields predated the pandemic,
   although these concerns may have increased the sensitivity of local
   communities towards health issues. The local debates on 5G involved many
   actors from the civil society, including environmentalists that had long
   campaigned against wireless technologies and local politicians playing a
   proactive role in leading and coordinating the adoption of resolutions
   against 5G. Originality/value This paper addresses an emerging
   phenomenon, such as municipal bans against 5G, that has not yet been
   explored in academic literature. Researchers have recently investigated
   the propagation of conspiracy theories on 5G on social media, but little
   has been said on the factors and actors shaping the debate on 5G within
   local communities.},

Title = {Vaccine hesitancy and the resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases:
   the way forward for Malaysia, a Southeast Asian country},

Abstract = {This study engaged health professionals in in-depth, semi-structured
   interviews to explore their opinions concerning the issues surrounding
   vaccine hesitancy in Malaysia and strategies to improve vaccination to
   stamp the rise of vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs). Opinions on how
   to address the resurgence of VPDs in the era of increasing vaccine
   hesitancy were obtained. Eight health professionals, including
   geriatricians, pediatricians, microbiologists, public health
   specialists, and family medicine specialists were interviewed. The
   influence of anti-vaccination propaganda, past-experience of adverse
   event following immunization (AEFI), perceived religious prohibition, a
   belief that traditional complementary and alternative medicine (TCAM)
   use is safer, pseudoscience beliefs, and anti-vaccine conspiracy
   theories were identified as reasons for refusing to vaccinate. The
   interplay of social, cultural and religious perspectives in influencing
   perceived religious prohibition, pseudoscience beliefs, and the use of
   TCAM contributing to vaccine refusal was found. Five broad themes
   emerged from the health professionals regarding strategies to address
   vaccine hesitancy, including establishing an electronic vaccination
   registry, increasing public awareness initiatives, providing feedback to
   the public on the findings of AEFI, training of front-line healthcare
   providers, and banning the dissemination of anti-vaccine information via
   social media. With regards to identifying strategies to address the
   resurgence of VPDs, mandatory vaccination received mixed opinions; many
   viewed supplementary immunization activity and the prevention of travel
   and migration of unvaccinated individuals as being necessary. In
   conclusion, the present study identified unique local cultural,
   traditional and religious beliefs that could contribute to vaccine
   hesitancy in addition to issues surrounding vaccination refusal
   similarly faced by other countries around the world. This information
   are important for the formulation of targeted intervention strategies to
   stamp vaccine hesitancy in Malaysia which are also a useful guide for
   other countries especially in the Southeast Asia region facing similar
   vaccine hesitancy issues.},

Title = {Anti-Masonry as political protest: fascists and Freemasons in interwar
   Romania},
Journal = {PATTERNS OF PREJUDICE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-57},
Abstract = {Clark analyses the anti-Masonic discourses used by fascist groups in
   interwar Romania. Unlike attacks on already stigmatized groups such as
   Jews and communists, the objects of anti-Masonic attacks had
   institutional power and were socially respectable. Romanian anti-Masonry
   was an attempt by politically marginal parties on the extreme right to
   undermine the authority of their mainstream opponents. Anti-Masonry was
   a core doctrine for both of the major fascist parties in interwar
   Romania-A. C. Cuza's National Christian Defence League and Corneliu
   Zelea Codreanu's League of the Archangel Michael-as well as for
   journalists and writers associated with smaller groups or those
   attempting to create a united fascist front. Drawing on a large corpus
   of anti-Masonic texts, they claimed to be opposing a global conspiracy
   against the Christian world by Freemasons in co-operation with Jews and
   communists. Fascists slandered specific individuals, including
   government ministers and leading writers, accusing them of treason and
   heresy because of their supposed ties to Freemasonry. Romanian
   Freemasonry's connections with French lodges led fascists to blame
   Masons for their country's pro-French, pro-League of Nations foreign
   policy, which they saw as evidence that Romania was run by Jews.
   Anti-Masonry extended beyond fascist circles and was also adopted by the
   Orthodox Church, which declared Freemasonry to be heretical and
   anti-Christian. Not limiting themselves to those who actually were
   Masons, fascists also accused other fascists of having Masonic
   connections as a way to undermine the nationalist credentials of
   political rivals. Anti-Masonic slander continued even after Freemasonry
   was dissolved in Romania, but decreased in frequency once fascists
   gained institutional power. For them, anti-Masonry was primarily a way
   to attack people in power and, once the fascists ruled Romania,

   lensing},

Abstract = {We propose a new technique for weak gravitational lensing in the radio
   band making use of polarization information. Since the orientation of a
   galaxy's polarized emission is both unaffected by lensing and is related
   to the galaxy's intrinsic orientation, it effectively provides
   information on the unlensed galaxy position angle. We derive a new
   weak-lensing estimator, which exploits this effect and makes full use of
   both the observed galaxy shapes and the estimates of the intrinsic
   position angles as provided by polarization. Our method has the
   potential both to reduce the effects of shot noise and to reduce to
   negligible levels, in a model-independent way, all effects of intrinsic
   galaxy alignments. We test our technique on simulated weak-lensing
   skies, including an intrinsic alignment contaminant consistent with
   recent observations, in three overlapping redshift bins. Adopting a
   standard weak-lensing analysis and ignoring intrinsic alignments results
   in biases of 5-10 per cent in the recovered power spectra and
   cosmological parameters. Applying our new estimator to one-tenth the
   number of galaxies used for the standard case, we recover both power
   spectra and the input cosmology with similar precision and with
   negligible residual bias. This remains true even in the presence of a
   substantial (astrophysical) scatter in the relationship between the
   observed orientation of the polarized emission and the intrinsic
   orientation. Assuming a reasonable polarization fraction for
   star-forming galaxies, and no cosmological conspiracy in the
   relationship between polarization direction and intrinsic morphology,
   our estimator should prove a valuable tool for weak-lensing analyses of
   forthcoming radio surveys, in particular, deep wide-field surveys with
   e-MERLIN, MeerKAT and ASKAP, and ultimately, definitive radio lensing
   surveys with the SKA.},

Title = {CIVIC EDUCATION IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF CONSTITUTIONAL ROT AND STRONG
   POLARIZATION},
Journal = {BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {101},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1771-1792},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This Essay argues that civic education is crucial to remedying what Jack
   Balkin, in The Cycles of Constitutional Time, diagnoses as
   ``constitutional rot{''} in the United States. A twenty-first century
   civic education must meet challenges of polarization and growing
   diversity and inequality and equip people for forms of democratic
   participation necessary to the health of constitutional democracy. Some
   commentators have called the insurrection on January 6, 2021, a
   ``Sputnik moment for teaching civics{''}-seeing a link between the
   whitesupremacist/conspiracy-theory mob's actions and the failure to
   instill civic virtue in ``We the People.{''} To be capable of spurring
   national reconciliation and renewal, civic education must reckon with
   systemic racism and with how to strive to overcome it. This Essay
   critiques the model of ``patriotic education{''} set out in The 1776
   Report as a signal of, rather than a cure for, constitutional rot. The
   Report's attacks on ``identity politics{''} and critical race theory as
   incompatible with ``authentic{''} civics education echo in recent
   proposed or enacted state and local laws prescribing whether and how
   teachers may teach students about racism and sexism. A better model of
   civic education, we argue, is the call for ``reflective patriotism{''}
   set out in the Educating for American Democracy Initiative. This model
   combines ``love of country with clear-eyed wisdom about our successes
   and failures in order to chart our path forward.{''} It helps students
   to engage with ``hard histories{''} of inclusion and exclusion and to
   understand how the constitutional order has become more democratic
   because of the efforts of social movements. It seeks to educate young
   people ``to participate in and sustain our constitutional democracy.{''}
   This model offers hope for addressing constitutional rot and preparing
   students to face present-day challenges.},

Title = {Complex Network and Source Inspired COVID-19 Fake News Classification on
   Twitter},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {139636-139656},
Abstract = {In COVID-19 related infodemic, social media becomes a medium for
   wrongdoers to spread rumors, fake news, hoaxes, conspiracies, astroturf
   memes, clickbait, satire, smear campaigns, and other forms of deception.
   It puts a tremendous strain on society by damaging reputation, public
   trust, freedom of expression, journalism, justice, truth, and democracy.
   Therefore, it is of paramount importance to detect and contain
   unreliable information. Multiple techniques have been proposed to detect
   fake news propagation in tweets based on tweets content, propagation on
   the network of users, and the profile of the news generators. Generating
   human-like content allows deceiving content-based methods. Network-based
   methods rely on the complete graph to detect fake news, resulting in
   late detection. User profile-based techniques are effective for bots or
   fake accounts detection. However, they are not suited to detect fake
   news from original accounts. To deal with the shortcomings in existing
   methods, we introduce a source-based method focusing on the news
   propagators' community, including posters and re-tweeters to detect such
   contents. Propagators are connected using follower-following relations.
   A feature set combining the connectivity patterns of news propagators
   with their profile features is used in a machine learning framework to
   perform binary classification of tweets. Complex network measures and
   user profile features are also examined separately. We perform an
   extensive comparative analysis of the proposed methodology on a
   real-world COVID-19 dataset, exploiting various machine learning and
   deep learning models at the community and node levels. Results show that
   hybrid features perform better than network features and user features
   alone. Further optimization demonstrates that Ensemble's boosting model
   CATBoost and deep learning model RNN are the most effective, with an AUC
   score of 98\%. Furthermore, preliminary results show that the proposed
   solution can also handle fake news in the political and entertainment
   domain using a small training set.},

   divisions expected to adhere rigorously to objectivity and political
   neutrality. However, OPCW's reputation has recently been tarnished.
   Dissenting scientists from within the organization have raised serious
   questions about the integrity of an OPCW fact-finding mission (FFM)
   investigating the alleged chemical attack in Douma, Syria on April 7,
   2018. The OPCW FFMs are tainted in three ways: (1) they rely upon
   information provided via intermediaries connected to states that are
   belligerents in the war in Syria; (2) the organizational structure of an
   FFM excludes scientific and verification divisions of the OPCW; and (3)
   control of FFMs is held by a bureaucratic office staffed by career
   diplomats who are from states involved with the Syrian war. Furthermore,
   officials involved with the Douma FFM investigation report the following
   anomalies: (a) an original interim report was secretly altered in order
   to make an unsubstantiated suggestion that an alleged attack had
   occurred; (b) A U.S. delegation was allowed to brief the FFM, an action
   prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention; and (c) formal attempts
   by the inspectors to obtain transparency and dialog was rejected by the
   OPCW. Meanwhile, the United States and its allies have dismissed
   questions as Russian ``disinformation{''} or as a ``conspiracy
   theory.{''} Overall, analysis of the alleged Douma attack and the OPCW's
   FFM supports the thesis that key international organizations have been
   effectively captured, or at the very least heavily influenced, by
   particular states that assume their own impartiality. This shortcoming
   poses a risk to international peace and security.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesTo explore communities' perceptions about COVID-19 in the
   context of the ANRS COV33 Coverage-Africa clinical trial evaluating the
   efficacy of treatments in preventing clinical worsening of COVID-19.
   DesignDescriptive qualitative study using semistructured in-depth
   individual interviews conducted by telephone in French and Soussou
   between May and September 2021. Data were transcribed, translated in
   French when applicable and analysed with the thematic analysis method.
   SettingThe eight neighbourhoods most affected by COVID-19 in Conakry's
   urban context, capital of Guinea.
   Participants4 community leaders acting as key informants-providing
   insights regarding population's opinions-and six community members, who
   were exposed to an information session conducted as part of
   Coverage-Africa.
   ResultsAccording to participants, community members have heterogeneous
   viewpoints about COVID-19: it exists and is dangerous; it is benign
   ('bad cold'); or it is fictitious (eg, government conspiracy). The fear
   of stigmatisation and social isolation of those sick or cured of
   COVID-19 was largely reported by participants, with illustrations of
   distressing situations for the victims. To avoid stigma, many patients
   seem to adopt strategies of discretion (eg, lying/hiding about the
   disease). Although community attitudes were reported to have evolved
   since the beginning of the epidemic, stigma remained a pervasive concern
   for many people.
   ConclusionsCommunity perceptions about COVID-19 in Conakry may be partly
   explained by the Guinean context of Ebola history and of sociopolitical
   tensions. Stigmatisation of COVID+ people seems to be aimed at
   protecting others against contamination. However, social avoidance can
   greatly affect the morale of stigmatised people, especially in
   collectivist cultures like Guinea. Further investigating stigma,
   including its role on seeking COVID-19 screening and treatment services,
   and its consequences on mental health among affected/exposed people,
   would contribute to identifying improved prevention and care
   interventions in preparation for future health threats, and to promoting
   participation in health research.Trial registration numberNCT04920838

Abstract = {The purpose of the research is dedicated to the criminological
   description and explanation of fraudulent behaviors that interfere in
   the results of official sports competitions in Ukraine. The foregoing is
   evidenced in the ultra-high level of latency of the possible crimes that
   could be committed and that are typified in art. 369-3 of the Criminal
   Code of Ukraine, which are 99 \% probability that the act will be
   committed in reality. The structure of the number of matches (where the
   results could be falsified) according to the type of sport, the method
   of illegal influence on the results of official sports competitions, as
   well as the types of bribery were revealed and analyzed. In addition to
   the characteristics and corresponding structural units. Methodology:
   Qualitative-quantitative research, based on the analysis of documentary
   sources, coupled with the dialectical method of contrasting the facts
   with social reality, with a comparative legal approach. Conclusions. The
   sample identifies that there is a greater intensity in fraud in sports
   such as soccer, futsal, basketball and volleyball. Within the mechanisms
   used to incite athletes to commit illegal acts, bribery predominates
   (75\%). At roughly the same level in terms of prevalence and with small
   fluctuations in specific weight are incitement (10\%), conspiracy (8\%)
   and coercion (7\%). In general, illegal influence on the results of
   official sports competitions such as bribery directly targets athletes.
   In total, the proportion of such influence is 78\%, with a slight
   predominance of bribery of multiple athletes (players) in a team (40\%)
   over bribery of an individual player (38\%). In second place in terms of
   ranking - bribery of members of the coaching staff (10\%). Then bribery
   of judges (5\%), owners of sports clubs (5\%), and finally on the
   support staff of clubs (2\%).},

Title = {Adherence Attitudes towards Mask Wearing Regulations in Russia during

Abstract = {The paper presents an empirical study of adherence attitudes to wearing
   face masks during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Russia
   (October 2020, N=884). The new questionnaire on adherence attitudes to
   wearing face masks is presented. It consists of 7 scales of attitudes,
   which determine adherence to mask wearing regulations. The structure of
   attitudes was described by a hierarchical model with a general factor of
   adherence attitude, three second-order factors with respect to the
   ``discomfort related to face coverings{''}, ``perceived threat of
   COVID-19 for oneself and others{''}, ``rational assessment of COVID-19
   pandemic{''}, and 7 factors of specific attitudes according to the
   questionnaire. The latter were 1) prosociality, 2) tolerance to physical
   discomfort caused by masks, 3) fear for oneself and friends and
   relatives, 4) COVID-19 anti-conspiracy beliefs, 5) comfort of
   communication while wearing a mask, 6) acceptance of restrictions of
   individual freedom, 7) stability of self-esteem. The specific attitudes
   significantly differentiated groups of participants, which differed in
   their adherence to mask wearing regulations and in their motivation for
   inconsistent adherence. Sociodemographic differences in attitudes and
   adherence to mask wearing regulations are described. It was revealed
   that on the attitudinal level, men were less oriented towards adherence
   to mask regime. Compared to women, they expressed less prosociality and
   less tolerance to physical discomfort caused by masks, associated
   wearing masks with manifestation of weakness, underestimated COVID-19
   threat for themselves and for their relatives and friends. In
   conclusion, the issue of unidimensionality of self-reports of adherence
   attitudes is discussed. We sum up that prosocialilty as an attitude
   towards necessity to care about health of other people plays the central
   role in the adherence attitudes structure. Directions for elaboration of
   practical guidelines to sustain adherence to restricting regulations
   during COVID-19 pandemic for different groups of participants are
   outlined.},

Title = {Vaccination Attitudes Examination (VAX) Scale: a Bifactor-ESEM approach
   in a youth sample (15-24 years)},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe Vaccination Attitudes Examination (VAX) Scale is a widely
   used scale designed to measure general attitudes toward vaccinations.
   However, evidence for the VAX's structural, convergent, and discriminant
   validity is still limited, especially in youth samples.MethodsThe
   present study examined the psychometric multidimensionality and evidence
   of convergent and discriminant validity of the VAX using the
   bifactor-exploratory structural equation modeling approach
   (bifactor-ESEM). Using a sample of 803 Serbian adolescents and young
   adults (Mage = 18.23, SDage = 2.66, age range = 15-24 years, 59.2\%
   female), we contrasted the original four-factor model of the VAX with
   alternative solutions (ESEM, bifactor-CFA, and bifactor-ESEM), and
   investigated associations between vaccination attitudes and a variety of
   external criteria.ResultsThe results supported the bifactor-ESEM
   solution with one general factor of vaccination attitudes and four
   specific factors (Mistrust of vaccine benefit, Worries about unforeseen
   future effects, Concerns about commercial profiteering, and Preference
   for natural immunity) as the best representation of the data. The
   general factor was well-defined, and three specific factors showed good
   validity and specificity after the general factor was taken into
   account. The results of convergent validity analyses showed that the
   general factor of vaccine attitudes and one specific factor (Mistrust of
   vaccine benefit) were good predictors of vaccine conspiracy beliefs,
   attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination, intention to get vaccinated
   against COVID-19, and trust in healthcare. The remaining three specific
   factors' contributions to external criteria were generally weak and
   nonsignificant. Evidence of the discriminant validity of the VAX scores
   was supported by weak positive associations of the general factor with
   medical fears and paranoid worry.ConclusionsThe present findings
   indicate that distinguishing general and specific components of
   vaccination attitudes offers a more nuanced assessment and understanding
   of vaccination attitudes.},

Title = {How do psychobehavioural variables shed light on heterogeneity in
   COVID-19 vaccine acceptance? Evidence from United States general
   population surveys on a probability panel and social media},

Abstract = {Objectives To (1) understand what behaviours, beliefs, demographics and
   structural factors predict US adults' intention to get a COVID-19
   vaccination, (2) identify segments of the population ('personas') who
   share similar factors predicting vaccination intention, (3) create a
   `typing tool' to predict which persona people belong to and (4) track
   changes in the distribution of personas over time and across the USA.
   Design Three surveys: two on a probability-based household panel (NORC's
   AmeriSpeak) and one on Facebook.
   Setting The first two surveys were conducted in January 2021 and March
   2021 when the COVID-19 vaccine had just been made available in the USA.
   The Facebook survey ran from May 2021 to February 2022.
   Participants All participants were aged 18+ and living in the USA.
   Outcome measures In our predictive model, the outcome variable was
   self-reported vaccination intention (0-10 scale). In our typing tool
   model, the outcome variable was the five personas identified by our
   clustering algorithm.
   Results Only 1\% of variation in vaccination intention was explained by
   demographics, with about 70\% explained by psychobehavioural factors. We
   identified five personas with distinct psychobehavioural profiles: COVID
   Sceptics (believe at least two COVID-19 conspiracy theories), System
   Distrusters (believe people of their race/ethnicity do not receive fair
   healthcare treatment), Cost Anxious (concerns about time and finances),
   Watchful (prefer to wait and see) and Enthusiasts (want to get
   vaccinated as soon as possible). The distribution of personas varies at
   the state level. Over time, we saw an increase in the proportion of
   personas who are less willing to get vaccinated.
   Conclusions Psychobehavioural segmentation allows us to identify why
   people are unvaccinated, not just who is unvaccinated. It can help
   practitioners tailor the right intervention to the right person at the
   right time to optimally influence behaviour.},

Pages = {464-473},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the study of folkloric elements in the works
   of Tatar writer of the second half of the twentieth century, Gumer
   Bashirov. Verbal folklore reflects the spiritual world of the people,
   its ideals and dreams, values of life, centuries-old creative experience
   of the people, language features, poetic idea of the world. Also,
   folklore is unique in its form and content, themes and subjects, which
   attract writers and poets. In the works, which depicts the spiritual
   world, the way of life of the people, their rural life, the use of folk
   traditions and elements is an integral part of the work of art. In the
   Tatar village prose, which includes the work of the studied writer, in
   order to reflect the Tatar life in the countryside, elements of family
   and household and calendar customs are often included in the skeleton of
   the work. In this work, the objects of study are the folklorisms used in
   Bashirov's autobiographical novel ``My homeland is a green cradle.{''}
   The aim of the study is identifying and studying of switching the
   function of the folkloric elements in the studied novel. The author sees
   one of the purposes for writing this novel is in the preservation of
   Tatar folk customs, rituals, traditional foundations of rural life and
   language specifics. The study enables to conclude that the
   autobiographical novel ``My homeland is a green cradle{''} by G.
   Bashirov has prominently many examples of Tatar verbal folklore. The
   author uses almost all the main genres of Tatar folklore: fairy tales,
   tales and legends, song folklore and baits (lyrical epic), small genres
   - proverbs, sayings, omens, winged words, good wishes, curses,
   conspiracies, oaths, as well as family and household and calendar
   customs that existed in the early twentieth century.},

Title = {`Eastern History with Western Eyes': E.A. Freeman, Islam and Orientalism},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VICTORIAN CULTURE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-45},
Abstract = {E.A. Freeman is remembered today as a confident proponent of English
   superiority, whose historical writings were distorted by mid-Victorian
   prejudices in favour of the Aryan race. This perspective privileges some
   of Freeman's ideas and works above others, and obscures the complexities
   of his view of the past which only fully emerge through an examination
   of his two neglected works on the East: The History and Conquests of the
   Saracens (1856) and The Ottoman Power in Europe (1877). In analysing
   Freeman's obscure Oriental volumes this article uses the insights of
   Edward Said who argued that the West exploits the East according to
   contemporary exigency and consistently represents the Orient as `other'.
   It demonstrates that Freeman composed the Saracens and Ottoman Power in
   direct response to Britain's support of the Ottoman Empire during the
   Crimean War and Eastern Crisis, and re-arranged the past to represent
   the Turk as distinct from, and inferior to, the West. Freeman's account
   of the distinctiveness of the Orient, however, suggests the need to
   revise literature on Western approaches to the East which has assumed
   that antagonism towards Islam declined in the modern period, or was
   masked behind narratives that purported to be secular and objective but
   which continued to empower Europe and subjugate the Orient. Juxtaposing
   Freeman's narratives on Western and Eastern history, I argue that his
   association of Christianity with European progress and Islam with
   Eastern barbarism is key to understanding his deep fear of cultural
   contact with the Orient. Far from bolstering the strength and power of
   the West vis-a-vis the East, Freeman's account of the fearful barbarity
   of the Islamic Orient is underpinned by his belief in an anti-Christian,
   Judeo-Islamic, conspiracy that threatened the West with degeneration and
   recapitulation.},

Abstract = {The reinvigoration of forms of white supremacy in the US and Europe has
   sharply delineated the connections between occluded racialised pasts and
   contemporary race politics in ways which make reparative history an
   urgent concern. This article argues that contemporary struggles over the
   politics of memorialisation telegraph more than a debate over contested
   histories. They are also signs of how the liberal narrative of `trauma'
   and healing no longer suffices as a way of marginalising the history of
   radical black agency. Building on the research by the Legacies of
   British Slave-ownership project, the article focuses on the incendiary
   year of 1831 and on a moment of collision - between black resistance and
   white entitlement. It situates a hitherto overlooked aborted slave
   uprising in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, within its multiple radical
   Caribbean, Atlantic and British contexts as a way of disrupting the
   distance between histories confined to `there' and those confined to
   `here'. The article explores how the link between slavery and capitalism
   can be connected concretely to the black claim made on the nature of
   that emancipation as a way of further developing the concept of
   reparative history.},

Abstract = {This article traces the biographies of Virendranath Chattopadhyaya,
   Agnes Smedley and Somerset Maugham to map a global network of Indian
   nationalist resistance to the British Empire. Maugham and Smedley
   fictionalized their experiences with the British Secret Intelligence
   Service and the Ghadar Party, respectively. I analyse the representation
   of Chattopadhyaya in Smedley's autobiographical novel Daughter of Earth
   and Somerset Maugham's short story `Giulia Lazzari' to consider the
   limitations of fiction in the production of historical knowledge of the
   Indian nationalist movement abroad.},

Abstract = {This article articulates the concept of ``conspiratorial
   narratives{''}-defined as stories which integrate a large range of
   events and archetypal characters from past and present in a single
   teleological explanation for the alleged suffering of a given social
   group-and argues that this particular linguistic construct is a key
   marker of extremist language. Using three different cases to illustrate
   our theoretical contribution (Nazi propaganda, Rwandan genocidaires'
   radio, IS' messaging), we show that paying attention to conspiratorial
   narratives leads us to significantly revise classic accounts of violent
   actors' language, and provides a better understanding of the link
   between that language and violence itself-more precisely, why violence
   happens, how much violence is directed to whom, and when it occurs.},

Pages = {451-467},
Abstract = {The issues of the Soviet-German confrontation in Iran in the second half
   of the 30s are considered. The relevance of the study is due to the
   exacerbation in the last decades of the scientific dispute about the
   reasons for the occupation of Iran during the Second World War by the
   Soviet Union and Great Britain. The novelty of the research is
   associated with the introduction into scientific circulation of archival
   sources on the topic previously inaccessible to researchers, allowing
   them to more deeply explore the issues raised. The author proves that
   Hitler's Germany on the eve of World War II strongly pressed the USSR,
   Great Britain and other European countries in the economy, politics and
   information and propaganda spheres of Iran. According to the results of
   the study, it is concluded that the loss of positions in Iran by Moscow
   and London caused the Soviet Union and Great Britain to strive for
   revenge and became the leading motive for the introduction of troops and
   the occupation of Iran in 1941, after the German attack on the USSR. It
   is argued that the occupation of the northern part of Iran for the
   Soviet Union was primarily a situation of restoring previously lost
   positions, which made it possible to build and try to implement new
   geopolitical plans.},

Journal = {MIDDLE EAST LAW AND GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {This article seeks to complement current research on the international
   dimension of the recent transformations in the Arab world by focusing on
   the subjective domestic political debates on external actors in Egypt.
   Approaching political transformations in post-revolutionary Egypt
   (2010-2014) as dynamic and reciprocal processes of claim making and
   receiving, I explore how the representations of external actors served
   as an important source for the military to legitimize the continuous
   expansion of its political powers. By doing so, I hope to illuminate on
   a period that was celebrated as a departure towards democracy, yet
   regressed into the re-emergence of a military regime three years later.
   Drawing from empirical findings gained in a multi-sited long-term field
   study from 2010 to 2014, I show that the `third hand' - a concept that
   is commonly used in the streets, the media and in political speeches to
   designate external interventions as attempts to undermine the stability
   of the country - had a major impact on the transformations. The article
   shows how the exploration of domestic public debates is key to a better
   understanding of the international dimension in political
   transformations.},

Abstract = {Can rational choice theory justify hope and patience in dealing with
   calamities such as financial collapse or terminal illness? The Book of
   Job is a good entry-point. Three friends of Job counsel him to avoid
   hopelessness and bitterness arising from frustration regarding
   calamities. They do so on non-rational grounds. They argue that Job
   should ignore the evidence and instead blindly uphold the belief `God is
   just.' However, such blindness permits magic, superstitions, and cultish
   beliefs. The specter of such beliefs is probably what prompted the
   fourth friend, Elihu, to dismiss the arguments of the three friends.
   Elihu reasons that one should be rational, i.e., acknowledge the
   evidence. This need not entail the conclusion `God is unjust' - as God
   cannot perform miracles on a daily basis. That is, given the evidence,
   one cannot sustain hop\textbackslash{}eful beliefs that God will
   interfere and reverse the course of natural catastrophes and shocks from
   which humans, as well as other living beings, suffer. One at best can be
   patient, accept suffering considering worse counterfactuals. Based on
   Elihu's critique of the arguments of the three friends, and building on
   Maimonides's interpretation, this paper concludes that standard rational
   choice theory can explain patience, but not hope.},

Title = {A Nationwide Natural Experiment of e-Health Implementation during the
   COVID-19 Pandemic in Poland: User Satisfaction and the Ease-of-Use of
   Remote Physician's Visits},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a considerable increase in the use of
   e-health applications. Shortly after confirmation of the first case of
   COVID-19 in Poland, the Ministry of Health allowed for the general use
   of remote physician's visits (RPVs) as a substitute for traditional
   visits to the physician's office. It was estimated that during the first
   year of the pandemic, as many as 80\% of primary care visits were
   provided remotely, mainly by phone. This study's main aim was to assess
   the use of e-health services in the initial phase of the COVID-19
   pandemic. Furthermore, the factors related to user satisfaction and
   positive assessment of the ease-of-use of RPVs were analyzed. The
   analysis was based on data obtained from a computer-assisted web-based
   interviewing (CAWI) survey among 2410 adult Internet users in Poland.
   The questionnaire consisted of 55 items, including a 16-item European
   Health Literacy Questionnaire, an 8-item e-Health Literacy scale, a set
   of questions about the use of and experience with e-health services
   during the pandemic, and items exploring the sociodemographic
   characteristics of the respondents. Univariate logistic regression
   models were developed for variables reflecting user satisfaction and the
   assessment of the ease-of-use of RPVs. The use of RPVs increased during
   the pandemic by about 200\%. Higher health literacy and e-health
   literacy, older age, higher income, a greater number of e-health
   services used before the pandemic, and telephone-based remote visits
   were significantly associated with higher user satisfaction and
   ease-of-use of RPVs. Respondents using RPVs for renewal of prescriptions
   were more favorable in assessing satisfaction and ease-of-use. A less
   positive assessment of satisfaction and ease-of-use was provided by
   students and vocationally passive persons in comparison to the employed.
   Finally, the perception of the threat of COVID-19 was associated with
   higher satisfaction and better assessment of ease-of-use. Persons
   declaring the intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 were more
   likely to be satisfied with remote visits. User satisfaction and the
   feeling of ease-of-use in the case of remote advice provided by a
   physician depend on many factors. Significant predictors include
   selected sociodemographic and economic variables, determinants
   associated with the perception of the threat of COVID-19, the aims and
   tools used for the RPVs, and earlier experience with e-health services.},

Abstract = {The arrival of the COVID-19 virus has led to an acceleration of four
   trends in our modern, technology-focused societies: the development of
   ITopia (a dystopian future where technology undermines our humanity)
   with its imbalanced computational rationality; the collapse of
   sensemaking; the spread of a culture of pessimism and misanthropy; and
   the denial of death. This article makes the case for the practice of
   embodied presence (mindfulness) and cognitive responsibility as means to
   return to a more grounded experience of life, consciousness and self
   amongst modern populations, and thus to help resolve these four

Title = {Determinants of trust in times of crises: A cross-sectional study of
   3,065 German-speaking adults from the D-A-CH region},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},

Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Interpersonal trust declined worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic;
   strategies are needed to restore it. We surveyed 3,065 quota-sampled
   German-speaking adults residing in the D-A-CH region. Using multinomial
   logistic regression models and backward elimination for variable
   selection, we calculated multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and
   95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) to appraise correlates of
   interpersonal trust using the Interpersonal Trust Short Scale (KUSIV3).
   Participants with high levels of interpersonal trust (top KUSIV3 tertile
   (T3)) tended to be older, male, residents of Switzerland, university
   degree holders, and workers with higher income and work satisfaction
   (all P-diff<0.01) compared to those in the lowest KUSIV3 tertile (T1).
   Optimism was most strongly associated with high interpersonal trust
   (ORT3vsT1 = 5.75, 95\%CI = 4.33-7.64). Also significantly associated
   with high interpersonal trust were: Having voted in the last national
   election (for the opposition, OR = 1.39, 95\%CI = 1.02-1.89 or the
   governing party, OR = 1.61, 95\%CI = 1.23-2.11) versus non-voters;
   perspective taking (ORT3vsT1 = 1.46, 95\%CI = 1.11-1.91); being more
   extraverted (ORT3vsT1 = 1.99, 95\%CI = 1.53-2.59) and more agreeable
   (ORT3vsT1 = 1.95, 95\% CI = 1.46-2.61); and scoring higher on complexity
   thinking (ORT3vsT1 = 1.32, 95\%CI = 1.01-1.72). Participants scoring
   significantly lower for interpersonal trust did not regularly
   participate in religious meetings (OR = 0.61, 95\%CI = 0.44-0.84, versus
   participation at least monthly); were more conscientious (ORT3vsT1 =
   0.68, 95\%CI = 0.51-0.91) or current smokers (OR = 0.68; 95\%CI =
   0.53-0.87, versus never smoking); had sleep problems >5 times a week (OR
   = 0.48; 95\%CI = 0.36-0.66, versus none); and scored high on conspiracy
   belief (ORT3vsT1 = 0.53; 95\%CI = 0.41-0.69). Results differed minimally
   by gender and country. These findings may be helpful in devising
   targeted strategies to strengthen interpersonal trust and social
   engagement in European societies, especially during times of crises.},

Abstract = {The work process of specialists in protection from information consists
   of many time-consuming tasks, including data collection, datasets
   formation, and data manual labelling. In this paper, we attempted to
   help such specialists with a two-model approach based on the iterative
   online training of binary classifiers. This approach is used for
   inappropriate information detection and applied on text posts from the
   VKontakte social network. The first model is used to detect text posts
   that are corresponding to the selected topic and is trained on the data
   that is labelled positively and negatively by experts as well as random
   text data. The second model is used to improve the accuracy of the first
   model and is trained only on the data that is labelled by the experts.
   The novelty of the approach lies in the constantly growing dataset,
   while the classifiers training process takes place during the operator's
   work. The approach works with texts of any size and content and
   applicable for Russian social networks. The research contribution lies
   in the original approach for inappropriate information detection. The
   practical significance of the approach lies in the automation of routine
   tasks to reduce the burden on specialists in the area of protection from
   information. Experimental evaluation of the approach is focused on its
   iterative retraining part. For the experiment, text posts of different
   topics from the VKontakte social network were collected and labelled.
   Those topics include: Aggression, Dangerous conspiracy theories,
   Radicalism, Gambling, Prostitution, and Sects. After that, we evaluated
   precision, recall, F-measure and ROC-AUC metrics for classifiers trained
   on random subsamples of different sizes and different topics. Those
   metrics were evaluated for both one-model and two-model implementations
   of the approach, while the following classifiers were used: linear
   support vector machine, passive-aggressive classifier, multilayer
   perceptron. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of the approach,
   as well as future work directions, were indicated.},

Title = {Myths and misconception of COVID-19 among hospital sanitary workers in
   Pakistan: Efficacy of a training program intervention},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Objective Hospital sanitary workers are among the prime source to
   disseminate information at a massive level, however they received least
   attention during the pandemic COVID-19. The study was designed to
   investigate the prevailing myths and misconceptions of the coronavirus
   pandemic among the sanitary workers of health care system. Further, a
   systematic training program is devised and tested to demystify the false
   myths with discerning truth and awareness-raising in hospital sanitary
   workers. Method A pre-post face-to-face intervention design was opted
   and the intervention was conducted at five locations by the project
   team. The intervention consisted a 3 days training program to target
   myths and misconceptions of hospital sanitary workers. The study was
   completed in 8 months starting from August, 2019 to March, 2020.
   Participants were recruited from local hospitals having a specialized
   indoor COVID treatment facility. The sample consisted of 82 participants
   (n = 25, 30.09\% females) with age ranging from 18 to 60 years (M +/- SD
   = 37.41 +/- 10.09). Findings The results indicated that 86.4\% of the
   participants never heard the name of the coronavirus before the pandemic
   in Pakistan. A majority of the participants (> 50\%) believed on a very
   alarming but unrealistic rate of mortality i.e., 30-60\%. The
   pre-testing showed a high prevalence of myths in all four domains (i.e.,
   popular treatments = 24.44, conspiracy myths = 7.93, home remedies =
   16.46, and COVID-reliance = 7.82). The pre and post comparison of
   individual myths showed significant improvement on 24 of the 26 myths
   with a decline ranging from 0.18 to 1.63. Overall, the intervention
   significantly decreased scores on all four domains of coronavirus myths.
   Conclusion The training intervention appeared to effectively reduce
   myths and misconceptions of sanitary staff workers and is advised to be
   included as a standard training program for sanitary workers of health
   care system.},
